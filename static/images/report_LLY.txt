## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products.

LLY's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 444.4%,  placing it at the 71.2th percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 throughout all periods, however, suggest that this outperformance may not be entirely attributable to manager skill (alpha), but rather higher exposure to market risk (beta), as evidenced by varying beta values.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $779.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $789.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $784.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $843.21

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.35 -  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral short-term outlook.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.21 - A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -3.3% - This indicates a recent weakening of relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 566.8% over the long term (2+ years) -  This represents a substantial projected outperformance.  This however is a high estimate, based on historical data and should not be considered a guarantee.


Given the current price of $779.00 is below the moving averages, and the negative 20-day relative strength change, a recent period of price decline is evident.  This is not a strong indication of a larger, sustained decline.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant variability in EPS and revenue.

* **Revenue:** Shows fluctuation but generally increasing trend, except for a minor dip in Q4 2023.
* **EPS:** Exhibits considerable volatility, with a large increase from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024, followed by a decline in Q3 2024.  There is a particularly notable negative EPS in Q4 2023. This volatility warrants close scrutiny for underlying causes.  Further investigation into the factors driving this variability would be needed.  The data alone is inconclusive about performance against expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally increased quarter-over-quarter, indicating strong growth.
* **Profit Margin:** Remains consistently high, indicating strong profitability.
* **Equity:** Shows a positive trend in equity growth.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):**  ROE is highly variable, ranging from a negative value to over 20%. This volatility should be investigated for potential causes.

The high profit margins across the period suggest that LLY efficiently converts revenue into profit.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news releases within the past two days, market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This information was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the observed historical period. While current price action is showing a recent decline and is below its moving averages, the long-term outlook, based solely on the provided data, remains positive.  The high and consistent profit margins, combined with generally positive revenue growth, suggest a fundamentally strong company. However, significant volatility in EPS and ROE warrants further investigation to identify the underlying drivers.  The analysis requires supplementing with recent news and analyst opinions to provide a more complete picture. The high projected return is based on past performance and is not a guarantee of future returns.


**8. Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the data provided and does not constitute financial advice.  Independent research and consultation with a financial advisor are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The lack of recent news and a deeper dive into the reasons behind the fluctuating EPS and ROE are significant limitations to this analysis.
