*   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently positive, and has grown substantially in recent years, indicating that LLY has outperformed its benchmark. A VERY good sign.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally low, indicating that LLY's price is not strongly correlated with the overall market. This could mean it's relatively less volatile (but the high MDD suggests otherwise, implying independent volatility).

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **LLY a Top Stock Split Candidate in 2026 (TipRanks):** A stock split would make the stock more accessible to retail investors. This usually happens after a period of strong price appreciation.
*   **Eli Lilly's Stock Drops as It Slashes the Price of Zepbound (Yahoo Finance):** A price cut could impact revenue but could also increase market share, as it can result in higher total demand.
