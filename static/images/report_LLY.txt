* **20-Day Moving Average:** $821.00

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and high MRI signals caution. However, the positive relative divergence change suggests potential short-term upward momentum.

The significant price drop from the previous close warrants further investigation into potential news or market factors impacting LLY.  The high expected return needs to be balanced against the high risk associated with the current market conditions.

**6.  Overall Analysis:**

LLY has demonstrated exceptionally strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the current price is below its moving averages and several technical indicators point towards a bearish short-term outlook,  combined with a high market risk indicator.  The recent price drop needs further investigation.  Despite this, the long-term outlook, based on high historical CAGR and a substantial projected excess return over the S&P 500, remains positive.  Long-term investors should consider the high risk indicated by the current market conditions and technical indicators while acknowledging the strong historical performance and projected returns.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the discrepancy in the October 30th earnings reports, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
