## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Performance Review

**0. Executive Summary:** Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), a leading pharmaceutical company, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  While recent price movements show some fluctuation, strong earnings and high profitability metrics suggest continued potential.  However, the high relative divergence compared to the S&P 500 warrants monitoring for potential corrections.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a leading pharmaceutical company developing and marketing a broad range of pharmaceutical products.

* **LLY Cumulative Return:** 588.79%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 119.91%
* **Return Difference:** 468.9%
* **Relative Divergence:** 74.9% (This indicates LLY's performance is significantly higher than the S&P 500, placing it in the top 75% of its historical performance range relative to the index.)


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and positive Alpha values for LLY across the observed periods.  This suggests that LLY has generated returns exceeding the market benchmark (Beta>1), with a significant portion attributable to factors other than broad market movements (positive Alpha). The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) also indicates substantial company growth.  However, high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight the inherent risk associated with LLY's performance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $1.08  | $11.44B       |
| 2024-08-08 | $3.29  | $11.30B       |
| 2024-04-30 | $2.49  | $8.77B        |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.06 | $9.50B        |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.06 | $9.50B        |

There's a discrepancy in the provided data showing two entries for 2024-10-30. Assuming the first entry is correct, the earnings show significant variability quarter-to-quarter.  Further investigation is needed to understand the fluctuations, especially the negative EPS in late 2023 and early 2024.  Overall, recent revenue numbers are strong.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $11.44B | 81.02% |
| 2024-06-30 | $11.30B | 80.80% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.77B | 80.91% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.35B | 80.88% |
| 2023-09-30 | $9.50B | 80.42% |

The company shows consistently high profit margins, indicating strong operational efficiency.  Revenue is relatively stable, with a slight increase in the last two quarters.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $14.24B | 6.81% |
| 2024-06-30 | $13.56B | 21.88% |
| 2024-03-31 | $12.81B | 17.51% |
| 2023-12-31 | $10.77B | 20.33% |
| 2023-09-30 | $11.22B | -0.51% |

Equity has been growing steadily, and Return on Equity (ROE) is generally high, though it shows significant variation between quarters.  The negative ROE in Q3 2023 requires further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LLY exhibits exceptional long-term growth exceeding the S&P 500 significantly.  High profit margins and generally strong revenue suggest a financially healthy company. However, considerable volatility in EPS and ROE highlights inherent risk.  The high relative divergence to the S&P 500 warrants caution, as such a large deviation is often unsustainable in the long term.  Further analysis is required to fully understand the drivers behind quarterly earnings fluctuations and the negative ROE in Q3 2023.  While the long-term outlook appears positive, investors should be prepared for potential short-term corrections and volatility.  A diversified investment strategy is recommended.
