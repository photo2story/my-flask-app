The cumulative return of LLY (532.59%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (112.74%). The difference is 419.9%, placing it at the 67.5th percentile of the historical range of this outperformance (max: 634.6%, min: -25.2%).  The provided Alpha values consistently show zero, suggesting the outperformance may be due to factors beyond the market's general movements, potentially company-specific events or sector-wide trends.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $744.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $780.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $778.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $805.14

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.26  -  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound. However, it's not a strong buy signal in isolation.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.0181 - A slightly positive value, hinting at a potential upward momentum, but very weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.8% - Shows a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 135.4% - This represents a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming continued positive performance.  The high expected return should be considered in light of the current downward trend.  A high expected return paired with a bearish short-term trend requires careful consideration of risk tolerance.
