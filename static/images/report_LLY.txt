## Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), a pharmaceutical company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Eli Lilly and Co. significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return for LLY is 579.80%, while VOO's is 117.56%.  The difference is 462.2%, placing it at the 73.9th percentile of the historical range (max: 634.7, min: -25.2).  This indicates a substantial outperformance.  The provided Alpha values of 0.0 throughout the years suggest that this outperformance isn't solely due to market movements, but rather specific to LLY's performance.  However, this needs further investigation beyond the provided data. The high beta values in later years suggest increased market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $796.28
* **Last Market Price:** $795.67
* **5-day Moving Average:** $772.98
* **20-day Moving Average:** $791.89
* **60-day Moving Average:** $832.66

The stock price is slightly below its 20-day moving average and considerably below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.05 (Slightly below neutral; suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.03 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though very weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.9 (Indicates a recent short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 549.5% (This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon assuming consistent past performance.  This projection should be treated with caution, as past performance is not indicative of future results.)


The difference between the closing price ($796.28) and the last market price ($795.67) is negligible and doesn't suggest a significant immediate price swing.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in EPS:

* **Revenue:** Shows a general upward trend, with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  The most recent quarter (2024-09-30) shows a slight increase compared to the previous quarter (2024-06-30).
* **EPS:**  Shows significant variation, including a negative EPS in 2023-11-02 and 2024-10-30. This volatility requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  Direct comparison to expectations is not possible without that information.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue demonstrates fluctuating growth; profit margin is consistently high, around 80%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has increased over time, while ROE shows substantial variation, including a negative value in one quarter (2023-09-30).  This highlights the need for a deeper analysis into the factors influencing profitability and return on equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to be completed.  The provided data lacks this context.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past period, as indicated by substantially higher cumulative returns. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn.  Earnings show significant volatility in EPS,  while revenue shows a general upward trend with consistent high profit margins.   Financial information highlights fluctuations in ROE that need further exploration. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a complete picture.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be considered highly speculative and dependent on the continuation of past trends, which is unlikely to hold.  A more thorough analysis including recent news, analyst ratings, and a deeper dive into the reasons for EPS volatility is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.
