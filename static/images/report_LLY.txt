**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 727.6
* **Last Market Price:** 726.39
* **Previous Close:** 753.71

* **60-day Moving Average:** 829.00

* **Expected Return:** 77.1% (Significant expected long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this needs to be critically evaluated given the current market situation)

The combination of a low RSI, negative PPO, and recent price drop suggests a potentially bearish short-term outlook, despite the positive relative divergence. The high expected return needs further justification and context.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

LLY has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  However, recent price action indicates a potential short-term downturn, possibly due to market corrections or company-specific news. The high expected return is intriguing but needs to be assessed carefully considering the current market conditions and the volatility in earnings.  The strong fundamentals and historical performance of LLY suggest a potentially compelling long-term investment opportunity, but further due diligence, including a thorough analysis of the recent price drop and earnings variability, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The provided data contains inconsistencies (duplicate earnings data, conflicting Alpha values) which need to be addressed for a more comprehensive analysis.
