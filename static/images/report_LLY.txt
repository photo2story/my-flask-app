* **20-Day Moving Average:** 839.19

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 23.19 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.73 – This negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -22.87 – This shows a recent decline in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 168.86% –  This implies a significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term.  However, this should be considered with caution, as future returns are inherently uncertain. The large divergence in past performance does not guarantee similar future results.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows mixed results. While revenue generally increased, EPS fluctuated significantly.  The October 30th, 2024, EPS of 1.08 is noticeably lower than the August 8th, 2024, result (3.29).  Analysis requires additional context such as the company’s guidance, to interpret these fluctuations effectively.  Note that the data has duplicate entries for October 30th, 2024. This should be clarified. We lack data on analyst expectations for comparison.

**5. (Added Section based on request 6) Revenue and Profitability & Capital and Profitability:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  The company displays consistently high profit margins (around 80%) across the provided quarters. Revenue experienced some fluctuation but overall shows a positive trend.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has generally increased, although ROE (Return on Equity) demonstrates variability, suggesting underlying financial dynamics worth further investigation.  The negative ROE in the 2023-09-30 quarter is notable and warrants further analysis.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Analysis of Recent News (Missing):** The report requires news from reliable financial sources within the last two days, particularly concerning earnings announcements and market outlook.  Information from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD, along with analyst opinions, is essential to complete this section.  Without this data, a complete assessment of recent market sentiment is not possible.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the historical period presented.  However, recent price action suggests a bearish short-term trend.  Oversold RSI levels might signal a potential short-term rebound, but further confirmation is needed.  The mixed EPS results and variable ROE require deeper analysis to understand the underlying factors driving the company's performance. The high expected return over the long term is promising, but investors should carefully consider the risks involved and the uncertainties inherent in long-term projections.  Crucially, the lack of recent news and analyst opinion prevents a thorough assessment of the current market outlook and the stock's near-term prospects.  Further investigation into the October 2024 duplicate EPS and Revenue data is essential.

**9. Recommendations:**

A complete analysis requires more information, particularly:

* **Clarification on duplicate data points:** The duplicated entries for October 30th, 2024 need clarification.
* **Recent news and analyst opinions:** Access to recent news articles from reliable financial sources and analyst reports on LLY is needed to give a current outlook on the company. This includes the comparison of recent actual results to expected results.
* **Detailed financial statements:** Deeper analysis of the company's financial statements beyond the limited data provided is needed to completely understand its financial health and future prospects.

Once this additional data is available, a more comprehensive and confident recommendation can be formulated.  Currently, the data indicates potentially strong long-term prospects but requires additional investigation to assess short-term risk and opportunities.
