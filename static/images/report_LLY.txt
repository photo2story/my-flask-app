**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

LLY has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return difference of 185.62% highlights this substantial outperformance.  The relative return difference of 58.2% suggests that this outperformance is considerable compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently positive alpha, indicating above-market returns.  Beta values fluctuate, implying varying sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has steadily increased, reflecting company growth.  Note that the high CAGR values may reflect periods of significant growth that could be unsustainable in the long term.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows significant risk associated with this performance.  A larger MDD represents the potential for much larger downside swings which need to be considered alongside such high return expectations.

* **Closing Price:** $751.45
* **Last Market Price:** $734.57 (a decrease of $2.25 or -0.3%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $789.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $808.14
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $832.01

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price drop might indicate short-term selling pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.47 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs S&P 500, long-term):** 121.2%


The technical indicators suggest a potentially bearish short-term outlook. However, the high expected return over the long term (2+ years)  should be interpreted cautiously given the high historical volatility.  The recent price drop (-2.25) is a notable change, but not drastically so.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue. Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying trends and drivers of this variability.  It is important to note that some dates are repeated (May 1st, 2025 appearing twice).  This may be a data error, and needs clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has demonstrated exceptional historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this comes with significant risk, as evidenced by the high Maximum Drawdown figures.  Recent price action and some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bearish trend.  The long-term outlook appears positive, given the high expected return.  However, this projection should be viewed with caution considering past volatility.  A thorough examination of the inconsistencies and potential data errors in the provided earnings and financial data is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Investors should consider conducting further due diligence, analyzing future growth prospects, and assessing risk tolerance before investing in LLY.
