## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets pharmaceutical products.

The cumulative return of LLY is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  LLY's cumulative return is 551.02%, while VOO's is 122.83%. This results in a difference of 428.2 percentage points. The relative divergence, considering historical data, places LLY at the 68.7th percentile, indicating substantial outperformance relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 suggest that the outperformance might not be entirely attributable to factors beyond the market (beta). However, the consistently high CAGR values over the years in the provided table indicate strong performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $766.60
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $749.25
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $771.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $789.43

The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  However, the recent price change of $1.67 from the previous close indicates a positive trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.66 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.15 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.6 (Positive, indicating short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 132.5% (Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 expected over the long term)

The recent price increase of $1.67, while positive, isn't drastic enough to characterize as a sharp rebound. The combination of a slightly bearish PPO and a positive relative divergence change suggests some market uncertainty, but the strong long-term expected return remains a key factor.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  There appears to be an error in the data, as the same data point (-0.06 EPS, $9.50B revenue) is repeated.  A more consistent data set is needed for accurate analysis.  However, the generally high revenue figures show strong financial performance.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent performance, remaining largely above $9 billion. Profit margins are remarkably high and consistently above 80%, reflecting strong efficiency and pricing power.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity shows growth, but ROE is volatile, ranging from a significant loss to over 20%.  This volatility requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY exhibits strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 based on provided historical data. The high revenue and profit margins demonstrate robust financial health. However, the recent price action suggests some short-term weakness, and the volatility in ROE warrants further scrutiny. The highly positive long-term expected return, combined with consistently high revenue, points towards a favorable long-term investment opportunity, despite some short-term market uncertainty.  However, thorough due diligence, including a review of the corrected earnings data and a deeper understanding of ROE fluctuations, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The seemingly duplicated data point in the earnings data is concerning and needs clarification.
