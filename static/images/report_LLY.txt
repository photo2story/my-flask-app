**7. 종합적인 결론**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) presents a compelling investment case based on its strong historical performance, recent earnings, revenue growth, and positive analyst sentiment. However, investors should be aware of the potential for short-term volatility (as indicated by the recent price drop and RSI nearing overbought levels) and the competitive landscape, particularly regarding Novo Nordisk. The high expected return suggests continued outperformance, but the MDD figures highlight the potential for significant drawdowns. Based on the current MRI, analyst consensus, and growth metrics, LLY appears to be a favorable investment, but careful monitoring of market conditions and company-specific developments is essential.
