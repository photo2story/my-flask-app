LLY has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.

Recent price action shows a slight downward trend compared to short-term moving averages.  Financial metrics show varied earnings, and a lack of readily available gross profit and total revenue data limits a complete financial analysis.

Earnings show significant volatility.  The two entries for 2024-10-30 are duplicated and likely represent an error in the data.  Further, without more complete data,  a comprehensive analysis is impossible.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of Total Revenue and Gross Profit data prevents a thorough assessment of LLY's financial health and profitability.  This missing information significantly limits the analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has shown exceptional historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action indicates a short-term weakening trend.  While positive momentum is suggested by the PPO, the negative recent relative divergence and volatile earnings raise concerns.  The high expected return (105.1%) for long-term investors is promising but should be considered in light of the market volatility indicated by the beta values and earnings fluctuations.   The significant lack of crucial financial data (Total Revenue and Gross Profit) severely hampers a complete and reliable analysis.  Further investigation into the earnings data and acquisition of complete financial statements is needed for a more robust conclusion.
