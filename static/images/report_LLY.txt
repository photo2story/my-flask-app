* **Closing Price:** 727.2 (Last Market: 724.9)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 777.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 830.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 887.37

The stock is trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price is slightly above the last market price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 19.51 - This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce, but it could also indicate further downside.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.03 -  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -23.97 - This shows a recent decline in relative strength against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (over 2+ years):** 169.04% - This represents a significant projected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. However, this is just a projection and actual results may vary significantly.  The 724.9 closing price does not suggest any immediate drastic price movements (no evidence of a sharp rebound or drop).

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

**Table 2: Recent Earnings**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 1.08     | $11.44 B      |
| 2024-08-08 | 3.29     | $11.30 B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 2.49     | $8.77 B       |
| 2023-11-02 | -0.06    | $9.50 B       |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.06    | $9.50 B       |


There's a discrepancy in the October 30th data.  One entry shows a positive EPS of 1.08 and the other shows a negative EPS of -0.06. Clarification is needed on the correct data.  Revenue has been relatively consistent, showing some fluctuation but generally positive growth.  Further analysis needs to be performed with confirmed EPS data to gauge true earnings performance.  The latest reported results (excluding the conflicting October data) show strong revenue and generally profitable quarters.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, as evidenced by its high cumulative return and positive Alpha values.  However, the stock is currently trading below its key moving averages, and technical indicators (RSI and PPO) suggest bearish momentum.  Recent financial performance has been strong in terms of revenue, but there is some uncertainty regarding the latest EPS data. While the long-term projected return is high, investors should carefully consider the current market conditions and the inherent risks involved in the pharmaceutical industry before making any investment decisions.  The conflicting October earnings data and a lack of real-time news data necessitate a more thorough investigation.
