However, further investigation into the negative EPS and ROE in Q3 2023 is necessary to fully assess the risk profile.  The volatile nature of the EPS and ROE necessitates careful monitoring of future earnings reports.  The high expected return should be considered in the context of the inherent risks in the pharmaceutical sector.
