* **Closing Price:** $732.41
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $731.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $799.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $828.84

* **RSI:** 23.49 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.14 (Bearish)

| 2024-10-30 | -$0.06| $9.50B         | *(Note: Duplicate entry)*

**6) Overall Analysis:**

LLY shows exceptionally strong historical performance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by high CAGR and significantly positive alpha. Recent price action suggests a possible downward trend, despite a recent slight uptick. Technical indicators show a bearish short-term outlook, but the company's financial health remains solid, with high profit margins and generally increasing revenue and equity.  The highly volatile earnings and some inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate entry, low ROE in Q3 2024) warrant a more in-depth investigation.  However, the long-term outlook based on historical performance and expected returns remains positive, suggesting that LLY could be a good investment for long-term investors who can tolerate risk.  Further analysis, including investigation of the inconsistent data points, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
