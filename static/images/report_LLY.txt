*   **Risks:** High MDD indicates potential volatility. Monitor news and analyst updates for any change in sentiment or fundamentals. The one headline about share selling by VIRGINIA RETIREMENT SYSTEMS ET Al warrants watching, though it might not be a major concern. The RSI showing an overbought state is also another risk.
