| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

| 2025-02-05 | 1.04  | $23.55B        | *(Duplicate entry likely a data error)*


Earnings are inconsistent. While there are periods of relatively high EPS, the inclusion of a negative EPS figure raises concerns about the company's financial health and future prospects.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the duplicate entry for February 2025.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a thorough financial analysis.  This lack of data significantly limits the ability to assess the overall financial health and performance of the company.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, though the RSI is not deeply oversold.  Inconsistent earnings figures and a lack of key financial data hinder a complete assessment.  The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 indicates significant investor pessimism.  Before considering any investment in DIS,  a thorough review of financial statements and a deeper understanding of the reasons behind the company's recent underperformance is crucial.  The data provided raises significant concerns about the current investment outlook.
