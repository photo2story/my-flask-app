## Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walt Disney Co. is an American multinational entertainment conglomerate.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 4.69% for DIS, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's cumulative return of 121.09%.  The difference is -116.4%, placing it at the 8.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $113.43
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $112.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $110.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $110.27

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent upward momentum, but still relatively close to both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a lack of strong directional trend.  The price shows a minor increase from the previous close ($0.24).


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 64.26 (Slightly above the neutral 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.50 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +2.6 (Indicates recent short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -820% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and requires further investigation of the underlying assumptions.)

The slight price increase, coupled with positive PPO and relatively high RSI, suggests some bullish sentiment. However, the drastically negative expected return warrants caution.  The provided data lacks context for how this expected return was calculated, making its reliability questionable.  It is crucial to investigate what model or assumptions generated this exceptionally low value.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue. There's a mix of positive and negative EPS figures, with revenue generally remaining relatively stable within a narrow range.  The duplication of the 2024-08-07 data point needs to be addressed; it's unclear if this is an error.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this earnings volatility.


| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-08-07 | 1.44  | $23.16 B    |
| 2024-05-07 | -0.01 | $22.08 B    |
| 2024-02-07 | 1.04  | $23.55 B    |
| 2023-08-09 | -0.25 | $22.33 B    |
| 2024-08-07 | -0.25 | $22.33 B    | *(Duplicate Data Point)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals relatively stable revenue, with profit margins generally hovering around 35%.  ROE shows considerable fluctuation, with some quarters recording negative returns.  This inconsistency in profitability warrants further examination to determine the underlying causes.


| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin | Equity      | ROE   |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| 2024-09-30 | $22.57B     | 36.96%        | $100.70B    | 0.46% |
| 2024-06-30 | $23.16B     | 36.48%        | $100.62B    | 2.60% |
| 2024-03-31 | $22.08B     | 35.82%        | $99.25B     | -0.02% |
| 2023-12-31 | $23.55B     | 33.81%        | $100.72B    | 1.90% |
| 2023-09-30 | $21.24B     | 35.37%        | $99.28B     | 0.27% |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

DIS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some technical indicators suggest short-term bullish sentiment, the extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a major red flag. Earnings and financial data reveal inconsistency and volatility, requiring deeper analysis to identify underlying factors affecting profitability and return on equity.  The provided -820% expected return needs significant clarification and validation before it can be considered reliable.  Further investigation is needed into the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and potential future catalysts before forming a conclusive investment opinion.  The duplicated data point in the earnings data requires immediate correction.
