* **Closing Price:** $111.31
* **5-day Moving Average:** $110.71
* **20-day Moving Average:** $110.99
* **60-day Moving Average:** $111.63

The price is slightly below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term.  The recent price change (-$0.46) represents a small decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.36 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.09 (Positive, suggesting a bullish trend but weak)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.4% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -530.6% (This figure is highly negative and suggests extremely poor expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  Further investigation into the methodology used to calculate this is required as this is unusually low).

The relatively low RSI and the slightly positive PPO indicate a mixed signal.  The recent price drop is not significant enough to suggest a major reversal, although the negative expected return raises substantial concerns.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|----------------|

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While some historical periods showed periods of outperformance, the recent performance has been poor, reflected in negative alpha and substantial negative expected return.  Earnings and financial data indicate volatility and a need for deeper analysis into the reasons for negative EPS and ROE in some quarters.  The -530.6% expected return needs clarification, as it seems unreasonably low and requires review of the calculation methodology.  Given the current situation, a cautious approach is warranted before investing in DIS, especially given the poor outlook relative to the market.  Further investigation into the company's strategic direction and the drivers of its recent underperformance is critical before making any investment decisions.
