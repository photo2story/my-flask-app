This should be disregarded.  The provided information does not explain the large negative expected return of -720.8%.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While short-term indicators (like 20-day relative divergence) show slight upward movement, longer-term trends appear bearish.  The fluctuating EPS and volatile ROE, in combination with recent underperformance, highlight significant concerns about Disney's current financial health and future prospects.  The erratic nature of the EPS numbers suggests underlying challenges in the company's operations.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the causes of the variability and the -720.8% expected return figure before forming a concrete investment opinion.  More detailed financial statements and analyst reports are crucial for a more complete assessment.
