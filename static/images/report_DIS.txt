The difference is -111.5%, placing it at the 11.2th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $111.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $112.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $114.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $103.38

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day MA to the current price indicates some recent stabilization, however, the distance from the 20 and 60-day averages still points to bearish momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 21.5 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is due. However, this should be interpreted with caution alongside the other indicators and fundamentals.
* **PPO:** -1.08 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +2.5 – Shows short-term upward momentum, but this is relatively small in the context of the longer-term trend indicated by the moving averages and other factors.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – This indicates that, based on the provided data, there is no expected return exceeding the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  Given the significant underperformance versus the index, this is a major concern.
* **Current Price Significance:** The price of $111.37 is not inherently problematic. The concerns lie in the relationship to the moving averages and overall market performance, as discussed above.  There is no evidence of a recent sharp price movement (either up or down) based solely on this data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals significant volatility.  Revenue has fluctuated around $22-23 Billion, with no clear upward trend.  EPS shows significant variability, ranging from a high of $1.44 to a low of -$0.25.  There is no consistent pattern to gauge performance relative to expectations without access to analyst estimates or other contextual data.  Importantly, there is no observable revenue growth trend, suggesting underlying business issues.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins have been declining slightly in recent quarters. This could signal weakening pricing power or increased operating costs.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, but ROE is highly volatile and has been negative in one recent quarter. This suggests inconsistent profitability and potential issues with capital efficiency.  Overall, the financial statements reflect significant variability in profitability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information about recent earnings news releases within the last two days, the current market outlook, and analyst opinions. This data was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

DIS is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500. While some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce (oversold RSI), the overall trend appears bearish.  The company's financial performance reveals inconsistent profitability, no clear revenue growth, and fluctuating EPS.  The lack of positive momentum relative to the broader market and questionable financials raise significant concerns.  Without additional information on recent news and analyst sentiment, a definitive investment recommendation cannot be made.  However, based on this data, the investment risk is high at present.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the significant underperformance relative to the market, inconsistent financial performance, and lack of a clear upward trend, a cautious approach is recommended.  Further research into recent news, analyst opinions, and a thorough competitive analysis are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The currently available data suggests that DIS is not a strong candidate for long-term investment in its current state.  A deeper dive into the factors affecting the revenue growth and profit margins is required before any investment recommendation.
