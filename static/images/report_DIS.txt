## Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Walt Disney Co (DIS), a global entertainment giant encompassing film, television, theme parks, and consumer products, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) based on the provided data.  The cumulative return for DIS is -1.86%, while the VOO's is 116.43%. This represents a massive divergence of -118.3%, placing it at the 6.8th percentile of its historical range of divergence (relative divergence of 6.8%).  The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility and recent underperformance, particularly between 2020-2023.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the report's date, DIS closed at $106.33.  The 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages are $107.87, $110.58, and $107.93 respectively.  This suggests a recent downward trend, with the price currently trading below all three moving averages. The slight difference between the closing price ($106.33) and the last market price ($106.30) is negligible and doesn't indicate any significant immediate price shifts.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 14.96 suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bullish reversal is possible. However, the negative PPO of -0.61 suggests bearish momentum. The 20-day relative divergence change of -2.7 points towards a short-term downward trend. The extremely negative expected return of -983.4% is likely an error in the data or misinterpretation.  It's crucial to cross-reference this figure with other reliable sources. Given the substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, long-term (2+ years) investment through dollar-cost averaging may be a considered strategy *only if* a fundamental turnaround in the company's prospects is anticipated.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  EPS has fluctuated between substantial profits and losses over the past several quarters. Revenue remains relatively stable in the $22-23 billion range, but without consistent profitability, it's hard to assess growth conclusively.  The repeated entry for 2024-08-07 needs clarification, likely an error in data entry.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data displays some consistency in revenue, generally staying within a narrow range. However, the profit margin shows some fluctuations, though the numbers themselves aren't exceptionally low or high compared to industry averages (further analysis would require industry benchmark comparisons). The ROE is volatile, indicating inconsistent profitability and possibly highlighting underlying operational challenges.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DIS exhibits significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, with negative cumulative returns and troubling volatility in both earnings and financial metrics.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and recent price action indicate a bearish trend. The highly volatile earnings and inconsistent ROE raise concerns about the company's operational efficiency and long-term prospects.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain the causes of the underperformance, the accuracy of the provided expected return figure, and the duplicate data entry in the earnings data.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence, including a review of the company's strategic initiatives and competitive landscape, is recommended.  The data provided suggests caution is warranted at this time.
