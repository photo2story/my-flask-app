## Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Walt Disney Co (DIS), a global entertainment giant encompassing film, television, theme parks, and more, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for DIS was 32.55%, while the S&P 500 achieved a cumulative return of 120.36%.  This resulted in a substantial divergence of -120.0 percentage points, placing it at the 5.7th percentile of the historical range of divergence between the two.  The provided Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, indicating marginal outperformance relative to the market benchmark on average. However, the Beta of 0.1 across all periods suggests that Disney's stock price is less sensitive to market fluctuations than the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last recorded data point, DIS closed at $108.70.  The recent price action shows:

* **5-day moving average:** $107.70
* **20-day moving average:** $110.15
* **60-day moving average:** $108.32

The price is slightly below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and slightly above the 60-day average, suggesting some short-term weakness but potential for recovery. The recent price change of $1.57 (1.47%) suggests a minor bounce after recent downturns.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The technical indicators provide a mixed signal:

* **RSI (35.74):**  Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.41):** Shows a bearish momentum, aligning with the negative relative divergence.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change (-4.8%):** Indicates a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-1196.1%):** This extremely negative figure for the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and needs further investigation to determine its accuracy and underlying assumptions.  It strongly suggests a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is anticipated over a 2+ year horizon.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The quarterly earnings data shows significant volatility:

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       | Notes                               |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce (oversold RSI), the overall trend remains bearish, supported by negative PPO and relative divergence.  Earnings have been volatile, and the extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 (-1196.1%) is a major red flag that needs to be critically assessed to understand the basis of this projection.  Further investigation into the drivers of this expected return figure and a careful review of the company's long-term strategic plans are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The relatively low beta suggests that the stock might offer some diversification benefits within a broader portfolio.  However, the substantial underperformance relative to the market and the volatility of earnings raise serious concerns.
