**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walt Disney Co (DIS) is a diversified international entertainment company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 8.64% for DIS, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a cumulative return of 128.31%. The difference is -119.7%, placing it at the 10.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided range of -135.9% to 24.2%).  This indicates considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows a consistently high Beta (above 1.4), suggesting DIS's price movements are more volatile than the overall market.  The Alpha values fluctuate, indicating periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. The negative CAGR in recent periods (2020-2024) highlights significant challenges.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $116.0 (Last-market: $115.79)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $114.61
* **20-day Moving Average:** $104.39
* **60-day Moving Average:** $97.0

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, though the relatively high RSI (see below) suggests caution.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 89.23 –  This extremely high RSI indicates the stock is significantly overbought, suggesting a potential correction or pullback is likely.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.09 – A positive PPO suggests upward momentum, but the high RSI might temper this interpretation.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +8.6 – This shows a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided expected return of 0% suggests that, based on current data, there is no significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 in the long-term (2+ years) with a buy-and-hold strategy.  This should be viewed with caution given the limited information and uncertainties in the market.  The provided 0% likely reflects the existing underperformance against the market.  More sophisticated forecasting techniques would be required to provide a more meaningful estimate.  

Given the closing price of $115.79 is close to the recent high, and given the very high RSI, a potential pullback or correction should be considered.  There's no evidence of a sudden dramatic price movement (rapid surge or drop) specifically indicated in the provided data.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show significant volatility.  While some quarters show positive EPS and revenue growth, others reveal losses.  The most recent quarter (2024-08-07) shows positive EPS and revenue, but without specific analyst expectations, determining if this is better or worse than anticipated is impossible.  A comparison to previous quarters and analyst forecasts would be needed for a complete assessment.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively consistent over the past year, while profit margins show some fluctuation but generally remain strong.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable, while Return on Equity (ROE) has shown significant variability, including negative values.  This suggests challenges in converting equity into profits.

(This section requires accessing current news sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD to gather information on recent earnings news, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights within the last two days.  Please provide these sources for a complete analysis.)


**7.  Summary:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, showing a high beta and considerable volatility.  Technical indicators (RSI) suggest the stock is overbought, increasing the likelihood of a correction. While recent earnings are positive in the last reporting period, consistent profitability remains a challenge.  The expected return of 0% against the S&P 500 over the long term reflects the existing underperformance.   Further research into recent news, analyst opinions, and detailed earnings comparisons against expectations is crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.


**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the overbought condition (high RSI), recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500, and volatile financial performance, a cautious approach is warranted.  Further due diligence, including detailed examination of the most recent earnings report compared to expectations, analysis of recent news, and consideration of a broader market outlook is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  A thorough understanding of Disney's long-term strategic plans and their potential impact on future earnings is also necessary.
