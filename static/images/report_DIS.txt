**5. Financial Information:**

No Total Revenue or Gross Profit data is available.  This is a significant gap in the information provided and limits a comprehensive financial analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, showing consistent negative alpha and high maximum drawdowns.  Technical indicators suggest potential oversold conditions but also bearish momentum.  The projected long-term underperformance is alarming and warrants further investigation.

Before making any investment decisions, comprehensive due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's financial statements, is strongly recommended.
