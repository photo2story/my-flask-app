**0. Overview:**

Walt Disney Co is a multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **DIS Cumulative Return:** 1.83
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 121.84
* **Return Difference:** DIS significantly underperformed VOO, with a difference of approximately -119.9 (-120.0) percentage points.  The relative divergence places DIS at the 5.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating substantial underperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant volatility in DIS's performance relative to the market (Beta) and inconsistent alpha (excess return relative to market).  While periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) exist, they are followed by periods of substantial negative returns. The high negative alphas in recent years (2020-2025) suggest significant underperformance relative to the market.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values indicate substantial risk.

* **Closing Price:** $110.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $109.50
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $111.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.14

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase (Last-market data shows a positive change) might signal a short-term bounce, but the overall trend indicated by the moving averages remains bearish.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 38.82 – Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term bounce.
* **PPO:** -0.25 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.5% –  Shows a recent decrease in relative strength against the market.
* **Expected Return:** -1226.5% – This extremely negative value suggests a very high risk and drastically low potential for outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This needs further investigation as it seems unusually low.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows inconsistent performance.  While some quarters show positive EPS, others show significant losses (e.g., 2024-05-07).  Revenue has fluctuated but generally remained relatively stable within a narrow range.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of this volatility.

**6. Summary:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, showing consistent negative alpha and high volatility. While some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce, the overall trend is bearish.  Earnings and financial data reveal inconsistencies and concerns about profitability. The extremely negative expected return (-1226.5%) needs further clarification; it's likely an error in the data provided.  Before considering any investment, a thorough review of DIS's business strategy, competitive landscape, and future prospects is strongly recommended.  The current data suggests substantial risk and warrants caution.  The duplicated data point in the earnings analysis further highlights the need for verification of the data's accuracy and completeness.
