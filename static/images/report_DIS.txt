* **5-Day Moving Average:** $113.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $110.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $110.56

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent stability or mild upward momentum.  It's also above the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term upward trend.  However, the negative daily change (-$0.37) indicates a recent minor decline.

* **PPO:** 0.47 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -767.6% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is expected to persist in the long term (over 2 years). This likely needs further investigation for accuracy)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-08-07 | $1.44  | $23.16 B     |

| 2024-08-07 | -$0.25 | $22.33 B     | *(Duplicate entry â€“ likely an error in the data)*


Earnings show volatility.  There are instances of both positive and negative EPS, highlighting the company's inconsistent performance. Revenue remains relatively stable around $22-23 Billion, but the profitability is highly variable.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

| 2023-09-30 | $99.28B     | 0.27%   |


Both revenue and profit margins show relative stability, though some fluctuation is observed.  ROE is volatile, indicating inconsistent profitability relative to equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

DIS has demonstrated significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years. While some positive indicators exist (e.g., positive PPO, price above moving averages), the negative alpha, volatile earnings, and extremely negative long-term expected return suggest caution. The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and ripe for correction.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings) require further investigation.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough review of Disney's business strategy, competitive landscape, and future outlook is crucial. The extremely negative long-term expected return (-767.6%) needs serious attention and recalculation/verification to ensure its accuracy.  It is highly improbable.
