## Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate.  The cumulative return of DIS (10.13%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (128.86%) resulting in a substantial divergence of -118.7 percentage points.  This places DIS at the 10.7th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  While the relative divergence suggests underperformance compared to the broader market, historical context (min/max divergence) should be considered.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows a consistently high beta (above 1.4), indicating higher volatility than the market.  Alpha is mostly positive, suggesting some degree of outperformance, although this varies significantly year over year and was negative in the most recent two years.  The high beta underscores the risk associated with DIS.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $117.6
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $115.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $106.48
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $97.91

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average may indicate a significant price increase in recent weeks.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (87.21):**  This extremely high RSI value suggests the stock is overbought and potentially vulnerable to a correction.
* **PPO (0.73):** A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum. However, the combination of high RSI and a recent substantial price surge warrants caution.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+9.6):**  Points to a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided expected return of 0% over the long term relative to the S&P 500 is concerning, indicating a pessimistic outlook.  Given the current price and market environment, this must be seriously considered.
* **Price Level ($117.61):** Given the high RSI, and positive but shrinking 20 day relative divergence, the recent increase is a sharp move and suggests potential for a pullback.  A correction might be imminent.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility:

* **EPS:** Fluctuates wildly between positive and negative values, demonstrating inconsistent profitability.  The most recent quarter (2024-08-07) shows a significant jump in EPS compared to the previous quarter, but this needs to be considered in context of previous trends.
* **Revenue:** Shows some growth but is inconsistent, lacking a clear upward trend.
* **Notable Misses:**  Several quarters reported negative EPS, indicating significant earnings misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue figures are relatively stable, although there is some fluctuation from quarter to quarter. No clear upward trend is evident.
* **Profit Margin:** Shows a general trend of improvement with minor quarterly fluctuations.
* **Equity:** Equity remains relatively stable, though there are minor fluctuations throughout the year.
* **ROE:**  ROE fluctuates considerably, including negative values in some quarters, highlighting challenges in profitability and efficiency.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DIS shows a mixed picture. While there are signs of recent positive momentum reflected in the share price (higher than moving averages) and positive PPO, this is countered by highly concerning indicators:

* **Significant underperformance** relative to the S&P 500.
* **High RSI**, suggesting an overbought condition and high risk of correction.
* **Volatile and inconsistent EPS** and revenue growth.
* **A pessimistic long-term expected return**.
* **High beta** indicating high volatility.

The current price increase seems sharp and unsupported by the fundamental financial data, making a short-term pullback quite likely. Investors should exercise caution, closely monitor news and market sentiment, and consider the high risk associated with DIS before making any investment decisions.  The lack of consistent profitability and the significant underperformance against the market raise serious concerns about its long-term prospects.  Additional research beyond the provided data is strongly recommended.
