## Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:**

Walt Disney Co (DIS), a global entertainment giant, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the past several years. While recent earnings show some positive signs,  key metrics such as RSI and PPO suggest the stock is currently trading below its potential.  A long-term investment strategy might be considered, but careful monitoring is necessary given the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Walt Disney Co is a mass media and entertainment conglomerate.

* **DIS Cumulative Return:** 2.59%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 117.28%
* **Return Difference:** -114.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 9.2% (This indicates that the current underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is in the lower 9.2nd percentile of historical divergences)


The provided CAGR data shows significant variability in DIS's performance relative to the market.  High growth periods were followed by substantial declines, highlighting the inherent risk associated with the stock. The consistently negative alpha values across most periods indicate underperformance relative to the market benchmark. Beta values fluctuate, reflecting varying levels of market sensitivity.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 9.0% | 6.0% | -20.0% | 0.1 | 186.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 17.0% | 5.4% | -2.0% | 0.1 | 193.4 |
| 2017-2019  | 28.0% | 5.4% | -2.0% | 2.5 | 258.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 62.0% | 16.8% | 35.0% | -0.3 | 323.5 |
| 2019-2021  | 27.0% | 16.8% | -44.0% | -0.5 | 276.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -55.0% | 17.9% | -64.0% | -0.6 | 155.1 |
| 2021-2023  | -75.0% | 17.9% | -98.0% | -1.1 | 161.8 |
| 2022-2024  | -23.0% | 17.9% | -56.0% | -1.2 | 201.3 |
| 2023-2025  | 7.0% | 13.3% | -51.0% | -1.2 | 201.0 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $111.2
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $110.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $111.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $111.86

The price is slightly below its 20 and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential for further consolidation or minor downward movement. The recent price increase of $2.34 (from $108.66) is notable.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 41.9  (Below 50, suggesting the stock is currently in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.67% (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.5% (Short-term upward trend)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO values, despite the recent price increase, suggest a lack of strong bullish momentum. The positive relative divergence change indicates short-term price strength, but this needs to be considered alongside the negative long-term outlook.  The significant price change of $2.34 suggests a potential short-term bounce or a market reaction to some news, but it's crucial to understand the cause.  The extremely negative expected return of -725.9% compared to S&P 500 over the long term is highly unusual and warrants further investigation for the source of this data.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-02-05 | $1.41 | $24.69B     |
| 2024-08-07 | $1.44 | $23.16B     |
| 2024-05-07 | -$0.01| $22.08B     |
| 2024-02-07 | $1.04 | $23.55B     |
| 2025-02-05 | $1.04 | $23.55B     |


There's a discrepancy in the data, with two entries for 2025-02-05.  Excluding the duplicate, revenue shows some variability but overall remains relatively stable. EPS is fluctuating, with a significant loss in Q1 2024.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $24.69B   | 37.60%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $22.57B   | 36.96%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $23.16B   | 36.48%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $22.08B   | 35.82%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $23.55B   | 33.81%        |

Revenue shows minor fluctuations, while profit margins are generally stable and relatively high, suggesting healthy profitability.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE    |
|---------|------------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $101.93B  | 2.51%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $100.70B  | 0.46%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $100.62B  | 2.60%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $99.25B   | -0.02% |
| 2023-12-31 | $100.72B  | 1.90%  |


Equity is relatively stable, while ROE shows variability, indicating fluctuations in profitability relative to shareholder equity.  A negative ROE in Q1 2024 is a significant concern.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500,  showing high volatility and negative alpha. While recent earnings suggest some stabilization in revenue and relatively high profit margins, technical indicators point to a lack of strong upward momentum.  The extremely negative long-term expected return requires clarification as to its source and calculation methodology.  The negative ROE during Q1 2024 is a major red flag. Before any investment decision, a thorough investigation into the reasons for underperformance and the -725.9% expected return figure is essential.  A long-term investment might be considered only after a comprehensive due diligence process addresses these concerns.
