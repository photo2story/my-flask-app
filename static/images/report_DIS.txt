## Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Walt Disney Co (DIS) is an American multinational entertainment conglomerate.  Its accumulated return (2.84%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had an accumulated return of 117.56%. The divergence, as of the last data point, is -114.7%, placing it at the 9.1st percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting marginal outperformance compared to the market benchmark (though this is less meaningful given the much larger difference in overall returns). Beta values are consistently above 1, showing higher volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $111.40
* **Last Market Price:** $112.56
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $111.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $114.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $103.93

The price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent market price of $112.56 is slightly above the closing price, indicating some minor upward pressure.  This minor increase, however, doesn't necessarily signal a reversal of the downward trend given the significant distance below the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.47 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.97 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.4% (Short-term upward momentum, although this is minor given the overall bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates no expectation of outperformance over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment given the current data).  This is likely heavily influenced by the recent underperformance of Disney relative to the index.

The low RSI and negative PPO confirm bearish signals. The slight increase in the 20-day relative divergence is a minor positive, but insufficient to overturn the overall negative outlook.  The market price of $112.56 is not significantly different enough from the closing price to suggest a dramatic market shift (i.e. a sudden surge or drop).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There is no clear trend in revenue, while EPS shows significant swings between positive and negative figures, indicating substantial challenges in profitability.  Missing data about earnings expectations prevents a complete assessment of beats or misses.  The only observation is the dramatic variation between quarters.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data reveals some inconsistencies. While revenue remains relatively stable, profit margins are fluctuating.  Equity shows slight fluctuations, and ROE is volatile, indicating fluctuating profitability. There is no clear upward or downward trend in these key metrics.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DIS is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions and bearish momentum, although a minor short-term upward trend is noted. The financial data exhibits instability in profit margins and ROE, and earnings show inconsistency.  Without analyst opinions or further news regarding recent earnings reports and market sentiment, a definitive long-term outlook is difficult to ascertain.  The provided expected return of 0% reflects the current underperformance.  Further analysis and consideration of external factors are needed for a comprehensive investment decision.
