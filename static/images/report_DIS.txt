**6. Overall Conclusion:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. While recent price action shows some upward momentum, the overall picture is one of underperformance.  The negative expected return (-564.1%) needs clarification.  Further analysis is needed, particularly focusing on the reasons for the negative EPS in Q2 2024, and a deeper dive into the company's long-term strategic direction and competitive landscape.  The provided data is insufficient to make a strong investment recommendation.  A more comprehensive analysis incorporating a wider range of financial metrics and industry benchmarks is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The extremely negative expected return requires immediate scrutiny.
