The significant negative Alpha in recent years is noteworthy and warrants further investigation into the underlying factors.

The extremely low expected return requires further investigation and should be treated with extreme caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 1.41   | $24.69B        |

Revenue generally remains relatively stable, though there's a notable increase in the latest quarter (2025-02-05).  The duplicate entry requires clarification or correction.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, as evidenced by the negative Alpha and large negative divergence. While financial statements show relatively healthy revenue and profit margins, recent quarterly earnings reveal volatility, including a concerning negative EPS.  The technical indicators present a mixed signal, but the negative PPO and relative divergence point to a bearish short-term trend. The extremely negative expected return value requires further clarification. Before making any investment decisions, a thorough investigation into the causes of the negative EPS and the extraordinarily low expected return is crucial, along with a detailed analysis of the company's long-term strategic plans and potential catalysts for future growth.  The data provided contains inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data and extremely unlikely expected return) that need to be addressed before drawing definitive conclusions.
