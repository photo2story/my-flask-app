## Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Walt Disney Co (DIS) is an American multinational entertainment conglomerate.  The cumulative return of DIS (2.79%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 114.36% over the analyzed period. The divergence is -111.6%, placing it at the 11.1th percentile of its historical range (relative divergence). This indicates DIS's substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures across different periods.  While Alpha is consistently around 0.1, indicating slight outperformance, the Beta varies across periods, reflecting changing market sensitivity.  The recent years show significantly negative CAGRs, highlighting a period of substantial underperformance.  The high MDD values in recent years also indicate high volatility and risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $111.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $112.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $114.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $103.08

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 21.06 (Significantly below 30, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.07 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.3% (Short-term upward movement, though still below moving averages)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates that no significant excess return is anticipated over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment at the current juncture.  This projection needs to be interpreted cautiously and possibly revised with more data points.)

The current price of $111.35, while below the moving averages, doesn't necessarily indicate an imminent dramatic price movement (either up or down).  Further analysis is needed.  The low RSI could signal a potential bounce, but the negative PPO and the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 suggest caution.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported EPS shows significant volatility, swinging from positive to negative values across quarters.  Revenue also shows fluctuations, though generally remaining around the $22-$23 billion range.  There are no specific expectations provided for comparison, therefore, it's not possible to assess whether earnings were "beats" or "misses".  The absence of consistent positive EPS and revenue growth raises concerns about the company's financial performance.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue fluctuates but remains relatively stable. Profit margins have generally been high, though there's been a slight downward trend recently.  Equity also fluctuates, and ROE (Return on Equity) shows considerable inconsistency.  The lack of consistent and positive growth in both Revenue and Profitability is concerning.

**6. News and Recent Issues:** (Information not provided; Requires up-to-date news sources for analysis)

This section requires information on recent earnings news releases, market outlook, and analyst opinions to provide a comprehensive overview.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DIS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent periods, indicated by its considerably lower cumulative returns and negative CAGR figures.  Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) suggest bearish momentum and oversold conditions.  Financial data reveals inconsistencies in earnings, revenue growth, and profitability. The current price is below key moving averages. While the 0.0% expected return projection signals a cautious outlook,  additional information on recent news, market sentiment, and analyst expectations is needed for a robust assessment.  Further research into the specific drivers of the company's underperformance and the potential for future recovery is vital.  The high volatility and negative recent CAGRs also indicate higher risk.
