**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $112.16
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $109.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $110.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $109.10

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the relatively small difference between the current price and the moving averages implies limited momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.77 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.16 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.0 (Short-term upward trend)

The recent price change of 1.01% is not significant enough to be classified as a sharp jump or drop.  The expected return of -192.1% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is extremely negative and suggests significant underperformance is projected.  This drastically low prediction requires further investigation into the underlying assumptions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over various periods. While recent price action shows a short-term uptrend, the long-term outlook (as indicated by the extremely negative projected return relative to the S&P 500) is concerning.  Profitability and revenue are relatively stable, but EPS volatility warrants investigation. The extremely negative long-term expected return needs further scrutiny, as it seems unrealistic based on the relatively stable financials.  A deeper analysis of the company's strategic direction and the factors driving the projected underperformance is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The data provided is insufficient to confidently justify long-term investment based on solely this analysis.
