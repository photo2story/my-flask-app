## Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Walt Disney Co (DIS) is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate.  At the end of the reporting period, DIS's cumulative return was 3.52%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 122.16%. This represents a divergence of -118.6%, placing it in the 6.7th percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows considerable volatility in DIS's performance relative to the market (Beta ~0.1 consistently low indicates low correlation with market movement,  suggesting it's less sensitive to overall market fluctuations than the average stock.). While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates significantly year-over-year,  the consistently low Beta suggests that DIS's performance is relatively independent of broader market trends. The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values highlight significant periods of underperformance. The consistently low alpha suggests it is struggling to outperform the benchmark, possibly due to its unique industry position.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $112.16
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $109.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $110.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $109.10

The price is currently above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the relatively small difference between these averages indicates the trend isn't overly strong.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 55.77 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, sitting near neutral territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.16 – A positive PPO indicates that the price momentum is bullish, although a relatively low value suggests the strength isn't particularly strong.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -0.3 – This indicates a recent minor downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** -1006.7% – This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant concern and would need further investigation to understand the basis of this projection.  It likely reflects the considerable underperformance shown in past years. Given the past performance,  this figure warrants extreme caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There were losses in Q1 and Q4 of 2023, while Q2 and Q3 of 2024 show profitability.  Revenue remains relatively consistent, showing a slight upward trend.  The inconsistent profitability needs more context and analysis before firm conclusions can be drawn.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some fluctuations but overall remains relatively stable, though it does not suggest consistent growth. Profit margins are relatively healthy and appear to be improving, though the Q3 2024 and Q4 2023 performance should be scrutinized. Equity has been relatively stable, but ROE (Return on Equity) is inconsistent, showcasing periods of both profitability and loss.

**7. Overall Summary:**

DIS shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, highlighting considerable risk. While recent price action suggests some upward momentum, the financial indicators are mixed, with profitability fluctuating and the long-term projected return significantly negative against the S&P 500. The low beta suggests limited correlation with overall market movements, meaning it has its own unique factors impacting its performance.  A deeper dive into the drivers of the negative expected return and an examination of future strategies and projections from the company are necessary before any investment decisions are made.  The data suggests caution is warranted. The inconsistent earnings and profitability, combined with the overall underperformance, raise serious concerns for potential investors.
