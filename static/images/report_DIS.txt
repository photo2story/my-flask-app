**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue        |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DIS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting periods of both strong and weak performance.  While revenue remains relatively stable and profit margins are high, the inconsistent earnings and volatile ROE signal potential challenges.  Technical indicators suggest a possible short-term correction, while the extremely negative long-term expected return (requiring further scrutiny) casts doubt on the stock's future prospects relative to the market.  Further investigation is needed into the discrepancies in the provided data (e.g., duplicate data point in earnings, extreme long-term expected return), and a deeper dive into the company's strategic direction and competitive landscape is crucial for a complete assessment.  The extremely negative expected return (-886.7%) needs to be verified before being considered as a reliable forecast.
