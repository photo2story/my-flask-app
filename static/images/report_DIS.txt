## Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Walt Disney Co (DIS) is an American multinational entertainment conglomerate.  The cumulative return of DIS is -20.98%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 112.74%. The divergence between DIS and VOO is -113.0, placing it at the 10.3 percentile of the historical range of divergence (-128.8 to 24.5).  This indicates significant underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows highly variable performance over different periods, ranging from a high of 62% to a low of -75%.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), the recent years demonstrate substantial underperformance. The consistently low beta of around 0.1 suggests lower volatility compared to the overall market.  However, the recent massive negative returns are concerning.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $108.12
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $109.20
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $111.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $107.57

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.71 (Indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.58 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.4 (Short-term upward trend, but weak considering the overall context)
* **Expected Return:** -614.3% (This extremely negative figure requires further clarification. It's likely a miscalculation or refers to a specific scenario not adequately explained.)  A negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon of 2+ years is a significant concern and warrants further investigation into the methodology.

The price of $108.12 is relatively low compared to recent moving averages, suggesting potential for a bounce back, but the significant negative expected return casts doubt.  Given the overall negative trends and extremely negative expected return, there’s no clear indication of an imminent 급반등 (sharp rebound).  However, the oversold RSI could signal a short-term bounce, but not necessarily a sustained upward trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While some quarters show positive EPS, others show significant losses.  Revenue remains relatively stable, although not showing consistent growth. The large loss in Q1 2024 (-0.01 EPS) and Q3 2023 (-0.25 EPS) is particularly notable. This erratic performance highlights the uncertainty surrounding Disney's future profitability.  Duplicated data entry for Aug 7th, 2024 needs correction.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DIS is currently experiencing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While some past periods show strong growth, recent performance is extremely weak, reflected in negative CAGR and a highly negative expected return.  The financial statements reveal fluctuating profitability and inconsistent ROE.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions but do not offer strong signals for a sustained recovery.  The highly negative expected return figure necessitates clarification and further scrutiny before making any investment decisions.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with DIS at present.  Further research into the reasons for the sharp decline is crucial before any investment decisions.  The large negative expected return should be investigated for accuracy.
