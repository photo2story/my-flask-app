* **Revenue:** Generally increasing, though with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.  Significant revenue growth is evident year-over-year.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UNH has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing stronger cumulative returns. However, recent performance (2022-2024) has been weaker, and the stock is currently trading below its moving averages.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition (RSI), but also bearish momentum (PPO).  Revenue growth is evident, but EPS shows considerable volatility. The provided long-term expected return should be interpreted cautiously.  More information is needed regarding recent news, market sentiment, and the methodology behind the expected return to provide a more comprehensive assessment.  A deep dive into the reasons behind the Q2 2024 EPS loss would be crucial.
