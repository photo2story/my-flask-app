However, there are potential positives:

*   **Analyst Support:** Analysts maintain a "Buy" rating and expect a significant price increase.

The data paints a mixed picture. UNH is facing significant headwinds, including underperformance, declining profitability, and regulatory scrutiny. However, analysts remain optimistic, and the company continues to grow revenue. The very negative expected return signal should be viewed cautiously and should prompt further investigation into the underlying reasons for this prediction.  A potential investor should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards before investing in UNH.  Pay close attention to the reasons for the recent EPS and ROE decreases, and whether the audit reveals any material issues.
