**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Table:**

This table offers a perspective on UNH's risk-adjusted performance over rolling three-year periods. Here are some key takeaways:

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate varies significantly, from a high of 65% (2015-2017) to lows of -31% to -47% in recent periods. This indicates volatile performance.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant potential for loss during these periods.  The recent MDD values are particularly concerning.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Negative alpha in the most recent periods (-57% and -105%) suggests UNH significantly underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) after accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are relatively low (0.1 to 0.4), suggesting UNH has been less sensitive to overall market movements than the S&P 500.  However, this hasn't prevented underperformance, as evidenced by the negative Alpha.
*   **Market Cap:** The Market Cap(B) column shows the general size in billions of dollars.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Previous Close:** $341.61
*   **Price Change:** -$1.99 (-1.99)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** $343.32
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $322.81
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $297.01

**Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day moving average, suggesting short-term downward momentum.  The price is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potentially mixed trend in the medium-term. The price change reflects a recent decline, warranting attention.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3324 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 69.07 (Approaching overbought territory - potentially signaling a pullback)
*   **PPO:** 0.1307 (Positive, suggesting a bullish trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)"
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** 7.0 (+), indicating short-term upward trend in relative performance.
*   **Expected Return:** 26.6% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** While the MRI indicates low market risk, the RSI approaching overbought levels warrants caution. The positive PPO and rising relative divergence suggest short-term strength.  The Hybrid Signal is a moderately positive signal. The significantly large change (-$1.99) from the previous close does reflect a short-term downward trend. The expected return of 26.6% suggests potential for long-term outperformance, but this should be considered in light of recent underperformance and the information presented above.
