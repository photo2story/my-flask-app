## UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) Stock Report

**0) Introduction:**

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) is a diversified healthcare company offering a range of products and services, including health insurance, healthcare delivery, and data analytics.  This report analyzes UNH's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), its recent price movements, key financial indicators, and earnings data.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **Cumulative Returns:** UNH achieved a cumulative return of 112.06%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's return of 89.44%.  The difference is 22.6 percentage points.
* **Relative Outperformance:**  The relative outperformance of 27.6% indicates that UNH's current performance sits in the top 27.6% percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range. This does *not* mean UNH is guaranteed to continue outperforming the market by that amount.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows variable Alpha and Beta across different time periods.  Generally, UNH exhibits a Beta greater than 1, suggesting higher volatility than the market. The positive Alpha values in most periods indicate outperformance compared to the market benchmark. However, the negative CAGR values in the last two periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025) indicate underperformance.  Note that market capitalization (Cap(B)) has increased steadily over time.  A deeper analysis would be needed to understand the drivers of these varying Alpha and Beta values.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While revenue generally increases, EPS shows significant fluctuation, including a negative EPS in Q2 2024.  Further investigation into the reasons behind these fluctuations would be necessary for a complete analysis.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue        |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| 2024-11-04 | 6.56 | $100.82 B      |

| 2024-05-09 | -1.53 | $99.80 B      |
| 2023-11-06 | 6.31 | $92.36 B      |
| 2024-11-04 | 6.31 | $92.36 B      |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, with profit margins consistently high (above 20%).  Equity fluctuates, and ROE shows some variability, including a negative value in Q1 2024, warranting further examination of the underlying causes.  Overall, the financial picture is mostly positive, although closer analysis of the quarterly variations is needed.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $100.81B  | 21.14%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $100.82B  | 22.84%        |

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE   |
|---------|------------|-------|
| 2024-12-31 | $92.66B   | 5.98% |
| 2024-09-30 | $94.53B   | 6.41% |
| 2024-06-30 | $89.36B   | 4.72% |

| 2023-12-31 | $88.76B   | 6.15% |


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

UNH has historically outperformed the S&P 500, with a strong cumulative return. Recent price movements suggest an upward trend, although the RSI indicates an overbought condition.  Positive PPO and 20-day relative divergence signal short-term upward momentum.  However, the recent earnings report displays volatility in EPS, and the financial statements also show some fluctuation in key metrics like ROE.  The provided 142.5% expected return needs further explanation and justification. A comprehensive analysis requires a deeper dive into the factors driving the variations observed in earnings, financial ratios, and the unusually high expected return.  Further due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions.
