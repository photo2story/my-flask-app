*   **Recent Divergence Change:**  The lack of change suggests the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is stable in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The very negative expected return is a significant red flag, suggesting a highly pessimistic outlook for UNH compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon. The sudden uptick(price': 358.66, 'previousClose': 354.5, 'change': 1.17) may signal a short-term rebound, but it needs to be considered in the context of the overall negative outlook.
