2025-12-22 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the analysis of UNH based on the provided data.

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Analysis**

*   **UNH Company Overview:** UnitedHealth Group Inc. is a diversified healthcare company providing health benefits and services.
*   **UNH Cumulative Return:** -18.39%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return (S&P 500):** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -119.3 (Relative Divergence: 6.8)

**Analysis:** UNH has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The divergence of -119.3 indicates a large performance gap. The relative divergence of 6.8 suggests that this underperformance is near the bottom end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500. The provided Alpha/Beta analysis sheds further light:

*   **Inconsistent Alpha:** Alpha, which measures performance above the benchmark, has fluctuated wildly.  Negative Alpha in several periods (especially 2018-2020, 2019-2021, 2022-2024, and 2023-2025) demonstrates periods of significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The recent -126% from 2023-2025 is a severe concern.
*   **Beta Changes:** Beta, which measures volatility relative to the market, has increased significantly in some periods (reaching 1.5 in 2019-2021 and 2020-2022). This suggests that UNH's price movements have become more correlated with, and amplified by, the overall market in those periods.
*   **CAGR and MDD:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has varied considerably, and the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating substantial risk.  The recent negative CAGR figures (-27%, -61%) are alarming.
*   **Cap(B):** The capitalization has been fluctuating between 400B and 300B in recent years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 327.42
*   **Previous Close:** 328.14
*   **Change:** -0.22
*   **5-day SMA:** 332.498
*   **20-day SMA:** 329.988
*   **60-day SMA:** 340.1082

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This suggests a short-term downward trend. The 5-day SMA being lower than the 20-day SMA reinforces this downward momentum.

**3) Index Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 52.25 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.1151
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Dividend_2.21 (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-08)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.3 (negative, indicating a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -283.7% (Negative, indicating significant expected underperformance compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, although it's important to consider this in light of the other negative indicators.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is near 50, suggesting a neutral momentum, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** Positive PPO value indicates uptrend in price.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Despite the negative indicators, the hybrid signal suggests a buy signal based on the current market situation.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The very negative expected return is a major red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   **"Better Buy in 2026: UnitedHealth Group or Eli Lilly?"**: This suggests some uncertainty or concern about UNH's future performance compared to other healthcare stocks.

**Analysis:** The news flow highlights a blend of opportunities (OptumRx expansion, dividend potential) and risks (policy uncertainty, audit scrutiny). The mixed sentiment may be contributing to the stock's recent underperformance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.96)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 392.24 / 440.00 / 280.00

**Analysis:**  Analysts generally have a "Buy" rating and a target price significantly higher than the current price. This implies they believe the stock is undervalued and has the potential for appreciation. However, it is important to note that the low target price (280.00) is much lower than the current price, which means that some analysts are bearish on the stock.

**Analysis:** Revenue continues to grow, as indicated earlier. However, profit margins have decreased in the most recent quarters. Return on Equity (ROE) has also decreased significantly in the last quarter, suggesting declining profitability relative to shareholder equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

UNH is currently presenting a mixed and concerning picture. While revenue is growing, profitability (both profit margin and ROE) is declining, and the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.

**Key Concerns:**

*   **Underperformance:** The large divergence from the S&P 500 and negative Alpha values are the biggest red flags.
*   **Declining Profitability:** Decreasing profit margins and ROE are concerning trends.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The very negative expected return suggests that the current market conditions could lead to significant losses in the future.
*   **Policy Risks & Audit Scrutiny:**  The news headlines highlight potential risks associated with policy changes and the need for improvements in response to external audits.

**Positive Aspects (Offsetting Concerns):**

*   **Analyst Ratings:**  Analysts generally maintain a "Buy" rating, suggesting potential undervaluation, although this may not fully account for recent trends and risks.
*   **Revenue Growth:** Consistent revenue growth is a positive indicator.
*   **OptumRx Expansion:** Growth opportunities in the OptumRx segment.
*   **Dividend Potential:** UNH may be an attractive dividend stock for some investors.
*   **Hybrid signal:** The current market situation suggests buy signal, despite the negative indicators.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the significant underperformance, declining profitability, negative expected return, and ongoing policy risks, a cautious approach is warranted. Despite the buy signal from the hybrid, analysts' consensus, and revenue growth, the negative aspects outweigh the positives. Potential investors should do more research before investing and current investors should consider reducing their holdings or closely monitoring the company's progress in addressing its challenges. The analyst target price is higher than the current, which means that UNH has the potential for appreciation.
