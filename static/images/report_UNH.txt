### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출         |
| :--------- | :---- | :----------- |
| 2025-05-07 | 6.9   | 109.58 B$    |

| 2025-05-07 | -1.53 | 99.80 B$    |

**Analysis:** The earnings data shows a recent increase in both EPS (Earnings Per Share) and revenue. However, there's an error in your provided data: the date `2025-05-07` is duplicated with different values. Assuming the first instance of `2025-05-07` is correct (EPS = 6.9, Revenue = 109.58 B$), this represents a strong quarter. The negative EPS in `2024-05-09` is concerning and should be investigated further to understand the cause.
