**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** 506.34
* **Last Market Price:** 506.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 496.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 551.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 571.63

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The 20-day and 60-day averages indicate a more significant pullback from recent highs.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.54 (Significantly oversold, suggesting potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -1.15 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +5.6 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 436.0% (This is a projected excess return over the S&P 500.  It should be viewed with considerable caution as any projected return involves significant uncertainty)


The relatively low RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, while the negative PPO and current price below moving averages suggest bearish momentum.  The provided 436% expected return is extremely high and warrants careful consideration.  It's crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results, and market conditions can significantly impact actual returns. The fact that the current market price of 506.10 is not considerably lower than the last closing price (506.34) does not suggest any significant, sudden market changes.
