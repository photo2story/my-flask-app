A thorough investigation into the reasons for the recent significant price drop and the negative EPS in Q2 2024 is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests caution. Further analysis is needed to determine if the current price presents a buying opportunity or if further downside is likely.  Consideration should be given to the inherent risks in the healthcare sector and the impact of any potential regulatory changes.
