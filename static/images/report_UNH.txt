## UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) is a diversified healthcare company providing health care products and services.  This report analyzes UNH's performance based on provided data, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

UNH's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.

* **UNH Cumulative Return:** 140.28%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** 18.44%

This indicates UNH outperformed the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 16.2% suggests UNH's performance is in the higher percentile range compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive Alpha values across multiple years, indicating UNH's outperformance relative to the market (beta is consistently greater than 1, indicating higher volatility than the market).  However, the recent years (2022-2025) show negative CAGR which indicates recent underperformance.  The high Beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  The substantial market capitalization (Cap) shows a large and established company.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 58.0% | 1.8% | 30.0% | 0.1 | 182.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 66.0% | 10.5% | 47.0% | 0.1 | 209.5 |
| 2017-2019  | 52.0% | 10.5% | 21.0% | 0.3 | 251.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 32.0% | 10.5% | 5.0% | 0.3 | 304.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 96.0% | 9.4% | 26.0% | 0.3 | 442.6 |
| 2020-2022  | 102.0% | 5.5% | 93.0% | 0.3 | 473.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 60.0% | 5.5% | 37.0% | 0.3 | 477.0 |
| 2022-2024  | -24.0% | 16.6% | -57.0% | 0.3 | 465.5 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

UNH's recent price action shows a downward trend.

* **Closing Price:** $523.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $529.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $533.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $540.37

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The closing price is lower than the previous close, indicating a price decrease.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (35.21):**  Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.25):**  Negative value signals a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-3.5):** Shows a recent short-term decline.

The price drop of approximately $7.67 (from 531.18 to 523.51) reflects a notable negative change, but doesn't necessarily qualify as a *dramatic* drop.  The expected return of 411.5% over the long term (2+ years) suggests significant potential outperformance of the S&P 500 if this projection holds true.

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While there were high EPS in Nov 2024 and Nov 2023, there was a significant drop in May 2024.  Revenue has remained relatively stable and shows a general growth trend.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

UNH has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting strong cumulative returns and positive alpha. However, recent performance shows a downward trend, reflected in negative CAGR, falling below moving averages, and a relatively low RSI.  While the company's financials show generally healthy revenue and profit margins,  volatility in EPS and ROE warrants attention.  The significant projected long-term expected return warrants further investigation to determine its validity and underlying assumptions.  The negative CAGR over the last couple of years suggests a need to reassess the long-term outlook and consider recent market conditions which have impacted the healthcare sector. Further analysis, including a review of the company's recent news and future guidance, is needed to form a comprehensive investment opinion.
