| 2020-2022  | -1.0%  | 81.2%  | 0.0%    | 1.5    | 480.3  |

| 2023-2025  | -60.0% | 79.8%  | -127.0% | 1.2    | 300.6  |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows a decline in recent periods, with significant negative growth in the most recent period (2023-2025).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the performance of the investment relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). Negative Alpha values in recent periods (especially 2018-2020, 2019-2021, 2022-2024, and 2023-2025) indicate that UNH has underperformed its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market.  A Beta close to 1 suggests UNH's price tends to move with the market.  The beta value fluctuate to 1.5 and went down to 0.3, and recently went up to 1.2, representing inconsistent fluctuation.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in Billions. Shows growth until recently, now declining.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 331.83
*   **Previous Close:** 327.58
*   **Change:** 1.3
*   **5-day SMA:** 327.358
*   **20-day SMA:** 330.706
*   **60-day SMA:** 338.8677

*   **Analysis:** The price is currently above both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, but still below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term upward trend, but it needs to break above the 60-day SMA to confirm a more sustained bullish move. The recent positive change in price (1.3) indicates a short-term positive movement.

**3) Indicators and Signals:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - This is contradictory to other negative indicators.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 50.93 -  Neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0162 -  Slightly negative, indicating a slight downward trend in momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** `cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Dividend_2.21 (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-08)` - This signal suggests a strong buy recommendation based on the model, with a focus on dividend income. However, it is inconsistent with other results, so use caution.
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -2.3 (Negative) - Indicates a short-term decrease in relative divergence, meaning UNH's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 has worsened slightly in the last 20 days.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -283.7 - This is a very concerning figure. It suggests a very negative expected return if investing from this point.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news articles present a mixed picture:
    *   Some articles discuss potential for future growth ("UnitedHealth Group Stock Will Soar in 2026").
    *   Others analyze the stock's recent performance and potential buying opportunities ("UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Stock Price Up 1.3% - Should You Buy?").
    *   One article presents both bull and bear case scenarios ("UNH Stock In 2026: Bull And Bear Case Scenarios").
    *   An article mentions the breaking of a losing streak ("UnitedHealth stock (UNH) breaks seven-session losing streak").

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean of 1.96, closer to a Strong Buy)
*   **Target Price:** Average target price of $392.24, significantly higher than the current price.
*   **Analysis:** Analysts generally have a positive outlook on the stock, with a consensus rating of "Buy" and a target price well above the current market price. However, consider the *age* of these ratings.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

This could be a cause for concern. Note that there is a duplicate date - "2025-10-28" & "2024-11-04" both have the same EPS & revenue, so there might be incorrect data.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Based on the provided information, UNH presents a mixed and somewhat concerning picture:

*   **Underperformance:** UNH has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial negative divergence. This is further supported by negative Alpha values in recent periods.
*   **High Volatility:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is high, indicating significant volatility.
*   **Decreasing Profitability:** While revenue is growing, profit margins and ROE are declining. This is a crucial factor to consider. The dramatic decrease in EPS in the latest results mirrors the issues with profit margins and ROE.
*   **Mixed Signals:**  The MRI provides a contradictory "High Investment Recommended" signal, which should be viewed with skepticism given the other negative indicators.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analyst consensus remains positive with a "Buy" rating and a higher target price, but the recent performance data raises questions about the validity of these older ratings.

**Conclusion & Recommendation**

The data suggests significant cause for concern regarding UNH.  The recent underperformance, declining profitability, and mixed signals warrant caution. While analyst ratings are still positive, the discrepancy between these ratings and the recent financial data necessitates a deeper investigation.

**Before investing, a thorough review of the following is strongly recommended:**

*   **Reasons for declining profitability:** Understanding why profit margins and ROE are decreasing is critical.
*   **Future outlook:** What are the company's projections for future growth and profitability? How do they plan to address the current challenges?
*   **More recent analyst reports:** Look for the most up-to-date analyst reports to assess if their optimism remains justified.
*   **Data Verification:** There is some potential data corruption in the earnings data, so it is important to verify this information.

The high investment recommendation by the MRI, and even the hybrid signal, appear to be at odds with the fundamentals and recent performance, suggesting potential flaws in those particular indicators. I would **not recommend investing in UNH** based solely on the information provided here, and would require significantly more positive information before considering it.
