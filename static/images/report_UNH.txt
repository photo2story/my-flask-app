**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR shows fluctuating performance over different periods, with negative values in recent years (2018-2020, 2022-2024, and 2023-2025). This indicates a decline in growth in these periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD values are consistently high, ranging from 56.6% to 75.7%. This suggests significant volatility and potential for large losses during the observed periods.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values reflect the stock's performance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). Negative Alpha values in recent years indicate underperformance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are mostly around 1.0 in the earlier years, indicating that the stock moved in tandem with the market. The Beta values of -0.0 and 0.0 in later years suggest a weaker correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** The market capitalization generally increased from 2015 to 2022, peaking at $478.6 billion, and then declined in subsequent periods. This trend reflects changes in investor sentiment and the company's overall performance.
