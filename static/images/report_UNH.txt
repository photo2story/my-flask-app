## UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) Investment Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) is a diversified healthcare company providing a range of health benefits and services.  Over the period analyzed, UNH has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for UNH is 135.34%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 115.96%. This represents a difference of **19.38 percentage points**.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, is at the 16.9th percentile. This suggests UNH’s performance has been consistently better than the broader market, but not always at the extreme high end of its historical performance range.  Alpha consistently around 0.1 indicates modest outperformance relative to market risk (Beta).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $507.80
* **5-day Moving Average:** $508.28
* **20-day Moving Average:** $532.60
* **60-day Moving Average:** $566.48

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (31.67):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce.
* **PPO (-0.06):**  Shows a bearish momentum, consistent with the price being below moving averages.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+3.2):**  Suggests short-term upward momentum, potentially counteracting the longer-term bearish trend implied by moving averages.
* **Expected Return (396.8%):** This exceptionally high figure needs further clarification on its calculation methodology. A 396.8% return over the long term (2+ years) is unrealistic and suggests potential errors or overly optimistic assumptions in the model used.  It's crucial to understand the basis of this expectation before relying on it.  The price of $507.80 doesn’t automatically trigger any significant events (no specific threshold is provided for a "significant" price move).

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-04 | 6.56      | 100.82        |
| 2024-08-09 | 4.58      | 98.86         |

| 2024-11-04 | 6.31      | 92.36         | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


**Analysis:**  Revenue shows relatively consistent performance around $100B, with a slight upward trend. EPS fluctuates significantly. Q2 2024 showed a substantial drop in EPS, possibly due to unusual circumstances. There's a discrepancy in the Nov 2024 entry, with different EPS figures reported. Without further information, it's difficult to assess whether these results beat or missed expectations.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has shown a general upward trend, although growth has slowed. Profit margins have fluctuated, with a recent decline after a peak in Q3 2023.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been generally increasing, but ROE has shown significant volatility, including a negative value in Q1 2024.

**Analysis:**  The financial information indicates a reasonably healthy company with growth, although profitability and return on equity are subject to considerable fluctuation.  Further investigation into the cause of the negative ROE in Q1 2024 would be beneficial.
