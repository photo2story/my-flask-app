*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is significantly negative in recent periods (2018-2020, 2019-2021, 2022-2024, 2023-2025), implying UNH has underperformed its benchmark (risk-adjusted).

*   **20-day SMA:** 323.98
*   **60-day SMA:** 342.9725

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is above both the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term upward trend.
*   However, the price is below the 60-day SMA, indicating a potential longer-term downward trend or consolidation.

*   **RSI:** 53.19
*   **PPO:** 0.58

*   **Expected Return (%):** -283.2

**Analysis:**

*   An RSI of 53.19 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   The PPO is slightly positive.
*   The negative change in relative divergence suggests recent underperformance compared to the market.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Do Not Buy:** The significant underperformance, negative outlook, and especially the extremely negative expected return, caution against any immediate investment.
*   **Further Due Diligence:** Investigate the reasons for the negative expected return, declining profitability, and negative news flow. Understand the factors driving the underperformance.
*   **Monitor Closely:** If you currently hold UNH, closely monitor the situation, paying attention to earnings reports, industry trends, and any company announcements that could affect its outlook. Re-evaluate your position based on new information.
