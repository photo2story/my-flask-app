*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR is unstable over the period, from highs in 2015-2017, to negative in recent years, indicating periods of strong growth followed by significant declines.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD indicates substantial risk and volatility. The figures are high in all periods.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is declining or negative in more recent periods, indicating UNH is underperforming relative to its expected return based on its risk.
    *   **Beta:** Beta generally increased and then decreased, suggesting UNH's volatility relative to the market has fluctuated. Recent Betas are in the 0.3-1.2 range.
    *   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Market cap increased for much of the period until the most recent period, showing a decline which mirrors the negative performance indicators.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close: 324.53
*   Last-market: {'price': 324.53, 'previousClose': 323.21, 'change': 0.41}
*   5-day SMA: 325.868
*   20-day SMA: 324.0505
*   60-day SMA: 342.7703

*   **Analysis:**  The stock price is slightly above the 20-day SMA but below the 5-day and significantly below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but the longer-term trend (60-day) remains downward. The minor increase in the "Last-Market" data shows a small positive change but does not indicate a strong reversal.

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 51.96
*   PPO: 0.4273
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = -5.1 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term Decline)
*   Expected Return (%): -283.2

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but this contradicts other indicators.
    *   RSI is neutral, neither overbought nor oversold.
    *   PPO is slightly positive, which can indicate a potential upward trend, but the value is low.
    *   The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy, potentially driven by the high MRI.
    *   The 20-day relative divergence change indicates a short-term decline.
    *   The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting significant potential losses if invested long-term from this point.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-10-28 | 2.59 | 113.16 B$  |
| 2025-08-11 | 3.76 | 111.62 B$  |
| 2025-05-07 | 6.9  | 109.58 B$  |

| 2025-10-28 | 6.56 | 100.82 B$  |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has generally been increasing over the past year, but EPS has fluctuated, with a recent decline in the most recent quarter. This could indicate rising costs or other factors affecting profitability.  The duplicate entry for 2025-10-28 needs to be clarified. If one entry refers to 2024, the EPS was flat, while revenue increased.

**6) Financial Information:**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Revenue       | Profit Margin  |

| 2024-09-30   | $100.82B      | 22.84%         |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity        | ROE            |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $95.79B      | 2.45%          |
| 2025-06-30   | $94.72B      | 3.60%          |

| 2024-09-30   | $94.53B      | 6.41%          |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue is growing steadily, but profit margins have declined in recent quarters. This is consistent with the EPS analysis. Equity has also been increasing. ROE (Return on Equity) has declined significantly in the most recent quarter, potentially due to the decreased profit margin.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

UNH's recent performance is concerning. It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While analyst consensus is a "Buy," the high target price range suggests uncertainty. The MRI is oddly positive, but most other indicators (declining EPS, profit margins, ROE, and a very negative expected return) suggest caution. The recent news articles provide mixed signals.

**Conclusion:** Based on the data provided, UNH presents a high-risk investment at this time. While there are some potentially positive signals (analyst consensus, news headlines), the negative trends in financial performance and the extremely negative expected return outweigh those positives. Further research and a deeper dive into the reasons behind the declining profitability and negative expected return are strongly recommended before considering an investment in UNH. The MRI's recommendation should be viewed with skepticism given the contradictory data.
