**2. Recent Price Movements**

*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 487.22

**Analysis:** UNH's current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The price decrease reflected in the last market data (price drop of -1.27 from the previous close) confirms this downward momentum.

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates a low-risk environment, but the extremely low RSI suggests the stock is heavily oversold and could be due for a rebound.
