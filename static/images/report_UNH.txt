2026-01-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) based on the data provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (UNH vs. S&P 500)**

*   **UNH Overview:** UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company providing a wide range of products and services.
*   **UNH Cumulative Return:** -20.24%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** -111.2 (Relative Divergence: 8.7)

**Analysis:**

UNH has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The divergence of -111.2 indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 8.7 suggests the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range, implying it *could* be due for a potential mean reversion. However, this needs further validation (and doesn't imply a guarantee of price appreciation - or mean reversion).

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| 2016-2018  | 22.0%    | 18.6%  | 19.0%    | 0.9    | 229.4   |
| 2017-2019  | 27.0%    | 18.6%  | 10.0%    | 0.9    | 270.8   |
| 2018-2020  | -41.0%   | 32.5%  | -62.0%   | 1.1    | 323.0   |
| 2019-2021  | 16.0%    | 32.5%  | -27.0%   | 1.1    | 462.5   |
| 2020-2022  | 0.0%     | 31.5%  | 2.0%     | 0.9    | 488.3   |
| 2021-2023  | 23.0%    | 13.4%  | 23.0%    | 0.5    | 484.9   |
| 2022-2024  | -24.0%   | 23.1%  | -44.0%   | 0.4    | 465.9   |
| 2023-2025  | -55.0%   | 58.5%  | -118.0%  | 0.3    | 304.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR and MDD:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows fluctuating performance, with strong years followed by significant declines. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates substantial risk, especially in recent periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, which measures performance relative to the market, is largely negative in the more recent periods, suggesting underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta has decreased over time, indicating that UNH's price is becoming less sensitive to market movements.  A beta of 0.3 in the most recent period suggests that, theoretically, for every 1% move in the S&P 500, UNH might move 0.3%.
*   **Cap:** The market cap increased steadily until recently but has decreased in the 2023-2025 period, which may be a point of concern.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 336.40
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 342.02, Previous Close: 336.4, Change: 1.67
*   **5-day SMA:** 331.89
*   **20-day SMA:** 330.90
*   **60-day SMA:** 337.34

**Analysis:**

The stock price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it is below the 60-day SMA, indicating a potential longer-term downward trend or at least consolidation. The recent positive change in the last market data confirms the short-term upward momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 49.62 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.19 (Potentially Bullish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 3.3 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -236.1% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A moderate risk indicator suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook.
*   **RSI:** An RSI around 50 is considered neutral, meaning the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) can indicate bullish momentum, but the value is close to zero and should be regarded cautiously.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a moderately bullish strategy, recommending investing most of available cash. The investment recommendation, based on the MRI, is for a "safe" investment with a moderate level of buying.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The short-term increase in relative divergence suggests that UNH is starting to close the gap with the S&P 500, but this has not been confirmed with the return data, indicating that this rise may not be sustainable.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-236.1%) is a major red flag. It indicates that, based on the model, the stock is significantly overvalued or that there are substantial headwinds facing the company.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Headlines:** The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   Some articles question UNH's attractiveness after a price decline.
    *   Others suggest investors are becoming bullish again.
    *   One article advises against buying the stock before the January 27th report.
    *   Another points to Barclays' analyst's expectation of a price increase.
    *   Several focus on the upcoming Jan 27th report and whether it can reverse the stock's slump.

**Analysis:**

The conflicting headlines highlight the uncertainty surrounding UNH. The focus on the upcoming January 27th report suggests that investors are waiting for more information before making a decision. The analyst opinions suggest that a catalyst, positive or negative, might come from that report.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:**  Insufficient data for consensus.
*   **Target Price:** Average: 392.44, High: 440.00, Low: 280.00

**Analysis:**

The average target price is higher than the current price, suggesting analysts, on average, believe the stock is undervalued. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates significant disagreement among analysts regarding the company's future prospects.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출         |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue Trend:** Revenue has generally been increasing quarter over quarter.
*   **EPS Trend:**  EPS has fluctuated.  It was relatively high in the middle of 2025 but decreased significantly in the most recent report, and the data seems duplicated. This drop in EPS is a cause for concern and needs further investigation.

*   **Equity:**  Equity has been relatively stable.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) has significantly decreased, especially in the most recent quarter. This is concerning as it indicates the company is generating less profit from shareholders' investments. The decrease in ROE aligns with the decrease in EPS in the earnings analysis.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** UNH has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators give mixed signals. The short-term trend might be upward, but the long-term trend is less clear. The RSI is neutral, while the PPO is slightly bullish.
*   **Negative Outlook:**  The extremely negative expected return (-236.1%) is a major cause for concern and suggests significant downside risk.
*   **Declining Profitability:** Recent declines in EPS and ROE are concerning and need to be investigated further.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analysts have mixed opinions, reflected in the wide range of target prices. The consensus points to an undervaluation, but the large range indicates disagreement.
*   **Upcoming Report:** The upcoming January 27th report appears to be a crucial event that investors are waiting for, as it could be a catalyst.
*   **Mixed News:** Recent news articles paint a mixed picture, with some questioning the company's attractiveness and others suggesting a potential rebound.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, UNH presents a *high-risk* investment opportunity. While there are some positive signals (potential short-term upward trend, potentially undervalued according to analyst consensus), the negative aspects (significant underperformance, extremely negative expected return, declining profitability, mixed news, and analyst uncertainty) outweigh them.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Exercise extreme caution.** Do not invest without significantly more research and understanding the reasons behind the negative expected return and declining profitability.
*   **Wait for the January 27th report** to see if it provides any clarity on the company's future prospects.
*   **Monitor:** Track the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 and pay close attention to any news or announcements that could affect the company's outlook.
