**Company Overview:** UnitedHealth Group Inc. is a diversified healthcare company providing health benefits and services.

*   **UNH Cumulative Return:** -17.22%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -119.4 (Relative Divergence: 6.8)

*Analysis:* UNH has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the covered period. The divergence of -119.4 indicates a substantial difference in returns. The relative divergence of 6.8 suggests that the current divergence is near the low end of its historical range, implying that the underperformance *could* be reaching an extreme.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | -11.0% | 81.2% | -116.0% | 0.1  | 300.4  |

*Analysis:*

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** -11.0% indicates negative average annual growth over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 81.2% signifies a very large potential loss from peak to trough during this period. This indicates high volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** -116.0% suggests significant underperformance compared to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500, implied by the Beta).  It implies the stock has generated significantly lower returns than expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** 0.1 indicates very low volatility compared to the market. The stock price is not very reactive to market fluctuations.
*   **Cap(B):** 300.4 - Market capitalization of the company in Billions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 332.16
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 331.5862, 'previousClose': 332.16, 'change': -0.17}
*   **5-day SMA:** 329.06
*   **20-day SMA:** 331.05
*   **60-day SMA:** 337.99

*Analysis:* The stock price is slightly down at the last market. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This *generally* indicates a short-term downtrend.  However, the differences are relatively small, so the trend might be weak.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Hybrid Signal Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 58.84
*   **PPO:** 0.06
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Dividend_2.21 (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-08)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.7 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -295.2%

*Analysis:*

*   **MRI:** Despite the other negative indicators, the MRI suggests "High Investment Recommended." This is a significant contradiction and warrants further investigation. The MRI might be based on different factors or a longer time horizon.
*   **RSI:** 58.84 is a neutral RSI, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** 0.06 is slightly positive, suggesting a weak upward trend in price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends buying 90% of cash (2 shares) with a safe strategy based on MRI 0.80. This contradicts the high investment recommendation of the MRI. This could indicate that this indicator is more conservative. The signal mentions a dividend of 2.21.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The positive change suggests a recent short-term improvement relative to its comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** -295.2% is a *very* negative long-term return projection compared to the S&P 500. This is a major red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Headlines:** "UnitedHealth: Undervalued Blue-Chip Stock With Multiple Levers To Pull & Ways To Win," "UnitedHealth: Valuation Is Reset, Bull Case Is Still Standing Tall"

*   **Comparative Headlines:** "UNH vs. ELV: Which Managed Care Stock Has the Edge Today?"
*   **Mixed Headlines:** "UnitedHealth stock today: UNH rises after hours as traders look ahead to January guidance"

*Analysis:* Recent news presents a mixed picture. While some articles highlight potential undervaluation and a positive outlook, others point to risks and policy delays. The comparative analysis suggests that investors are actively evaluating UNH against its competitors. The "rises after hours" headline hints at positive anticipation regarding future guidance.

*   **Opinions:** 25
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 392.24 / 440.00 / 280.00

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-10-28 | 2.59 | 113.16 B$ |
| 2025-08-11 | 3.76 | 111.62 B$ |
| 2025-05-07 | 6.9  | 109.58 B$ |
| 2024-11-04 | 6.56 | 100.82 B$ |
| 2025-10-28 | 6.56 | 100.82 B$ |

*Analysis:* Revenue has generally been increasing over the quarters. However, there appears to be a duplicated data point in the table for 2025-10-28. EPS shows some fluctuation, with the most recent value (2.59) being significantly lower than previous quarters. The dip in EPS compared to revenue increase could indicate rising costs, or other profitability issues.

*   **Profit Margin:**  Profit margins have decreased in the last 3 quarters, which aligns with the EPS drop from the earnings analysis and warrants attention.
*   **Equity:**  Equity has remained relatively stable around $94-$95 billion.
*   **ROE:** ROE (Return on Equity) has decreased significantly, also aligning with the trend indicated from the previous earnings report.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Negative Performance:** UNH has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 with a large divergence.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The technical indicators present conflicting signals. While the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, the large drawdown from the alpha, beta analysis and expected return is very negative.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts remain largely positive with a "Buy" consensus and a substantial target price upside.
*   **Financial Concerns:** Recent earnings and financial data show a concerning trend of decreasing EPS, profit margins, and ROE.
*   **News Context:**  Recent news is mixed, with both positive and negative headlines.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Underperformance Rationale:** Investigate the specific reasons for UNH's underperformance relative to the S&P 500. Is it sector-specific, company-specific, or a combination of factors?
    *   **Profitability Decline:**  The declining profit margins and ROE are a critical concern. Understand the drivers behind this decline and whether it is temporary or a longer-term trend.
    *   **MRI Discrepancy:**  Understand why the MRI is indicating "High Investment Recommended" despite the negative return projections and profitability concerns. Is it a lagging indicator, or is it based on a different set of factors?
    *   **News Impact:** Assess the potential impact of the recent news headlines (both positive and negative) on UNH's future performance.
    *   **Analyst Sentiment:** While analysts are optimistic, consider whether their target prices have been recently revised downward in light of the recent earnings and financial data.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, a **cautious stance** is warranted on UNH. While analysts are optimistic and the company's revenue is growing, the significant underperformance, negative return projections, and declining profitability are serious concerns. Further investigation is necessary to understand the underlying drivers of these issues and assess the potential for a turnaround. The conflicting signals from the technical indicators also add to the uncertainty. A potential investor should investigate the items raised above and the long-term profitability outlook of the company before making any investment decisions.
