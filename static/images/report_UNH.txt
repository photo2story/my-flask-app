## UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:**

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), a diversified healthcare company, shows a cumulative return significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period.  While exhibiting positive alpha in some periods, recent performance reveals a considerable divergence from the market benchmark, coupled with concerning negative price momentum and mixed financial indicators.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **Company Overview:** UnitedHealth Group Inc. is a leading diversified healthcare company offering a range of health benefits, including insurance, technology, and data analytics services.

* **Cumulative Returns:**
    * UNH: 45.11%
    * VOO (S&P 500): 76.18%
    * **Difference:** -31.1%  (This represents UNH's underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The relative divergence of -31.1% places it in the 12.6th percentile of historical divergence based on a range of -43.3% to 53.4%.)


* **Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows fluctuating alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and a relatively stable beta (market sensitivity) around 0.7.  The negative CAGR in recent periods (2018-2020, 2022-2024, 2023-2025) indicate periods of underperformance.  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) also suggest significant risk exposure.  The substantial market capitalization (Cap(B)) consistently demonstrates UNH's size and importance within the market.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $454.11
* **Previous Close:** $585.04
* **Change:** -$130.93 (Significant Drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $561.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $539.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $516.54

The stock price shows a clear downward trend, with the closing price significantly below all moving averages. This confirms the negative price momentum. The large negative change from the previous close indicates a substantial price drop that requires further investigation of potential triggering factors.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.29 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.757 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -44.9% (Significant downward divergence)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 86.3% (This suggests a substantial potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term, but the recent price action casts doubt on this prediction's near-term reliability.)

The combination of a low RSI, negative PPO, and significant negative divergence points towards a bearish trend. The substantial price drop needs to be analyzed for underlying causes.  The long-term expected return needs to be viewed cautiously given recent performance.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue          |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| 2024-11-04 | 6.56    | $100.82 Billion   |

| 2024-11-04 | 6.31    | $92.36 Billion   |

There is a notable fluctuation in EPS, with a significant negative EPS in May 2024.  Revenue remains relatively stable, though not showing significant growth.  The duplicated entry for 2024-11-04 needs clarification.  Further investigation is necessary to understand the reasons behind the EPS volatility.

| 2023-12-31 | $88.76 Billion | 6.15%         |

Equity shows some volatility, and ROE reflects this, even exhibiting a negative value in Q1 2024. This requires further investigation into the underlying causes.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

UNH's recent performance is concerning. While historical data suggests periods of outperformance relative to the market, recent negative price momentum, coupled with a significant drop in price and mixed financial signals (especially concerning EPS and ROE), warrants caution. The long-term expected return should be viewed with skepticism given the current downward trend and the need for clarification regarding some of the provided data points (duplicated earnings data, large price drop).  Further analysis into the factors driving the recent negative performance (Q1 2024 results, etc.) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The seemingly contradictory positive long-term projection and negative short-term realities require a thorough reassessment of the underlying fundamentals and market conditions affecting UNH.
