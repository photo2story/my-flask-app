**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals a mixed picture:

* **Latest Quarterly Results Comparison:**  The most recent quarter (ending 2024-11-04) shows a significant increase in EPS from the previous quarter (2024-08-09) ($6.56 vs $4.58), but a substantial decrease from 2024-05-09 which shows a negative EPS (-1.53). Revenue has remained relatively stable, hovering around the $100B mark with slight fluctuations. The repeated 2024-11-04 entry suggests a potential data entry duplication.
