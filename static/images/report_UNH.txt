**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue        |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2024-11-04 | 6.56   | $100.82 B      |

| 2024-11-04 | 6.31   | $92.36 B      |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-04.  Revenue remains relatively stable, while EPS shows significant volatility, with a notable negative EPS in Q2 2024.  Further investigation is needed to understand the cause of this fluctuation.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $99.18B    | 21.56%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $97.86B    | 21.52%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $98.78B    | 22.26%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $93.25B    | 22.33%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $91.36B    | 24.51%        |

Revenue shows relatively consistent growth, although profit margins have slightly decreased recently, which correlates with the lower EPS in Q2 2024.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE          |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $94.53B    | 6.41%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $89.36B    | 4.72%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $86.69B    | -1.63%       |

| 2023-09-30 | $84.49B    | 6.91%        |

Equity has generally increased, but ROE shows significant volatility, mirroring the EPS fluctuations. The negative ROE in Q1 2024 is a key concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

UNH has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong positive alpha.  However, recent performance (2022-2025) indicates increased risk, with negative CAGR and high MDD.  The recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  While long-term expected returns are high, the significant volatility in EPS and ROE, coupled with the negative results in the latest quarter, necessitates careful consideration of the underlying risks before investing.  Further investigation is crucial into the reasons for the Q2 2024 negative EPS and the overall volatility of recent financial performance.  The high expected return should be critically examined for its underlying assumptions.
