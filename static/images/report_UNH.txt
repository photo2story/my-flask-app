**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue         |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2024-11-04 | 6.56   | $100.82 B       |

| 2024-11-04 | 6.31   | $92.36 B       |

There's a duplicated entry for November 2024.  Revenue remains relatively stable, but EPS shows significant volatility, including a substantial loss in Q2 2024.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for this volatility.  The high EPS in Q4 2024 is positive.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UNH has historically outperformed the S&P 500, displaying a strong alpha. However, recent performance shows some volatility, with negative CAGR in the latest periods and fluctuating earnings.  While the expected return is high, it should be viewed with considerable caution given the inherent risk indicated by the data, particularly the negative ROE and the significant EPS drop in Q2 2024.  A thorough investigation into the causes of this recent volatility is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The relatively high beta suggests higher-than-market volatility should be expected.  Further due diligence is recommended before investing.
