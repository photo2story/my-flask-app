2025-03-05 - Analysis Report
## UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH) Stock Report

**0) Overview:** UnitedHealth Group Inc. is a diversified healthcare company providing health benefits, insurance, and related services.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

UNH's cumulative return (116.91%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (108.99%) by 7.92 percentage points.  This places UNH's relative performance at the 9.4th percentile based on historical data (max 135.7%, min -5.4%).  While this suggests strong outperformance, remember this is relative to past performance, not a guarantee of future returns.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha, indicating UNH's outperformance relative to the market (likely S&P 500), especially from 2017-2021. However, the significant negative CAGR in the last two periods (-24% and -38%) highlights considerable market volatility and the potential for substantial losses. The beta values suggest high market sensitivity,  meaning UNH's price movements tend to be amplified relative to broader market fluctuations.  Note that market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth throughout this period.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 58.0% | 1.8% | 30.0% | 0.1 | 181.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 66.0% | 10.5% | 47.0% | 0.1 | 208.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 52.0% | 10.5% | 21.0% | 0.3 | 249.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 32.0% | 10.5% | 5.0% | 0.3 | 302.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 96.0% | 9.4% | 26.0% | 0.3 | 439.9 |
| 2020-2022  | 102.0% | 5.5% | 93.0% | 0.3 | 470.4 |
| 2021-2023  | 60.0% | 5.5% | 37.0% | 0.3 | 474.1 |
| 2022-2024  | -24.0% | 16.6% | -57.0% | 0.3 | 462.7 |
| 2023-2025  | -38.0% | 16.6% | -88.0% | 0.2 | 434.1 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $474.61
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $469.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $502.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $518.47

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase (Last-market) of $1.62 indicates a small upward movement, but it's insufficient to overcome the longer-term downward trend indicated by the moving averages.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (29.27):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.676):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (5.8+):** Short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (779.6%):** A remarkably high projected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500. This figure needs further justification and context, as it seems exceptionally high and requires deeper analysis to verify its basis.  The increase from the previous close (Last-market data) is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant sudden upturn or downturn.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-04 | 6.56     | $100.82 B     |
| 2024-08-09 | 4.58     | $98.86 B     |
| 2024-05-09 | -1.53    | $99.80 B     |
| 2023-11-06 | 6.31     | $92.36 B     |
| 2024-11-04 | 6.31     | $92.36 B     |

There's a duplicate entry for 2024-11-04.  Revenue remains relatively stable, while EPS shows significant volatility, with a substantial loss in Q2 2024.  Further investigation is needed to understand the cause of this loss.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $100.81B  | 21.14%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $100.82B  | 22.84%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $98.86B   | 22.31%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $99.80B   | 23.05%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $94.43B   | 23.30%        |

Revenue is relatively consistent, with slight fluctuations. Profit margins are generally high but show some decrease in recent quarters.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE           |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $92.66B   | 5.98%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $94.53B   | 6.41%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $89.36B   | 4.72%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $86.69B   | -1.63%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $88.76B   | 6.15%         |

Equity shows some fluctuation.  The negative ROE in Q1 2024 is concerning and requires further analysis to determine the underlying cause.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

UNH has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong alpha and consistent revenue. However, recent performance (especially the last two periods' CAGR and the Q2 2024 earnings report) presents cause for concern. The high expected return needs further justification.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but bearish momentum is also present.  A thorough analysis of the Q2 2024 loss and the basis of the exceptionally high expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high beta suggests significant market risk.  Further research into the company's fundamentals and current market conditions is strongly recommended before investing.
