## UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

UNH, UnitedHealth Group Inc., is a diversified healthcare company.  The provided data reveals a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While UNH shows positive cumulative returns, the substantial gap highlights a need for deeper analysis.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Returns:** UNH (42.19%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) (82.57%).  The divergence of -40.4% places it in the 7th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided relative divergence metric.  This indicates UNH's underperformance is notable within its historical context.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The table shows varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and alpha values across different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, represented by beta), others show negative alphas, notably in recent years (-17%, -27%, -44%). This indicates inconsistent performance relative to the market.  The consistently high Beta values (above 0.1) show that UNH's price is highly sensitive to market movements.  The significant changes in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggest high volatility.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects company growth, but it does not guarantee consistent stock performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $424.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $431.766
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $521.5995
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $509.3018

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a possible downtrend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages suggests a notable drop in price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk) suggests moderate volatility.
* **RSI:** 28.79 (below 30) indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is due.
* **PPO:** -3.57 (negative) points towards bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Divergence:** -53.5% (significant negative change in relative strength over 20 days), signaling a sharp decline relative to the market.
* **Expected Return:** 410.0% is a high projected return, assuming a long-term (2+ years) investment with dollar-cost averaging.  However, this estimate lacks context and requires further analysis to assess its reliability. It represents a substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but the validity of this prediction needs justification.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue           |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| 2024-11-04 | 6.56    | 100.82 B$         |
| 2024-08-09 | 4.58    | 98.86 B$         |
| 2024-05-09 | -1.53   | 99.80 B$         |
| 2023-11-06 | 6.31    | 92.36 B$         |
| 2024-11-04 | 6.31    | 92.36 B$         | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*

Revenue has shown consistent growth, although EPS is highly volatile. The large negative EPS in May 2024 is a significant concern and needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  Duplicate data entry suggests potential data errors.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data severely limits a comprehensive financial analysis. This missing data hinders a proper evaluation of UNH's financial health and profitability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UNH exhibits significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in recent periods.  While the oversold RSI and high expected return might suggest a potential turnaround, several factors raise concerns.  The negative PPO, large negative relative strength divergence, and the highly volatile EPS figures along with missing key financial data indicate a need for caution.  The high beta underscores the sensitivity of UNH to market fluctuations. Further investigation is required to determine the underlying reasons for the recent underperformance and the reliability of the high expected return projection.  A thorough review of the missing financial data and a deeper dive into the causes of the May 2024 EPS loss are crucial before making any investment decisions.
