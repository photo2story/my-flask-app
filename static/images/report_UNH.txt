The projected long-term return is substantial, but it's crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with any investment.  The negative EPS in Q2 2024 requires deeper investigation. Careful consideration of risk tolerance is paramount before investing.  Additional fundamental and qualitative analysis is recommended before making any investment decisions.
