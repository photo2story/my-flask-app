### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **RSI:** 41.02
*   **PPO:** -0.51

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 41.02 indicates that the stock is nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential buying opportunity, but further confirmation is needed.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends selling a significant portion of holdings and increasing cash reserves, reflecting a risky outlook (MRI 0.50)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** A negative change (-0.3) suggests a short-term downward trend in relative performance.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-196.6%) is highly concerning. It suggests a very pessimistic outlook for UNH's long-term performance relative to the S&P 500.  This should be investigated thoroughly.
* **Last Market Data:** The large positive change in the last market data ('change': 2.71) suggests a recent, sharp upward movement, which could be a reaction to news or market conditions. This might be a temporary bounce within a larger downtrend, or it could signal the beginning of a reversal.
