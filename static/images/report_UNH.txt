## UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) is a diversified healthcare company providing a range of health benefits and services.  Over the period analyzed, UNH's cumulative return (158.95%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO)  (120.73%). The difference in cumulative returns is 38.2 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 30.3% indicates UNH's performance is positioned relatively high compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, remember this is a relative measure, not an absolute guarantee of future outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha values, suggesting UNH has outperformed the market (relative to its beta) over the observed periods.  The beta values range from 0.1 to 1.  This indicates that the company's stock price is less sensitive to overall market movements than a typical stock.  The CAGR shows high growth, but it's essential to note the significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) experienced in some periods, highlighting potential risk.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth.

* **Closing Price:** $560.62
* **5-day Moving Average:** $581.05
* **20-day Moving Average:** $596.58
* **60-day Moving Average:** $584.58

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend. The last market price of $561.39 is slightly higher than the closing price, potentially indicating short-term fluctuation.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (40.18):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 30), suggesting potential for a bounce, but not a strong buy signal alone.
* **PPO (-0.96):** Negative, indicating bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-16.0):**  Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (225.1%):**  This represents a significant projected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming consistent outperformance.  This is a high expectation and should be considered cautiously.  A large potential return also correlates to a correspondingly large potential risk.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported EPS shows volatility, with a significant negative EPS in 2024-05-09.  Revenue has generally shown an upward trend, though there's some quarter-to-quarter variation.  There is a data duplication for the 2024-11-04 entry. Without further information or context, specific comments on "beats" or "misses" cannot be made.  The large difference in EPS between some quarters needs additional investigation to determine the cause of the fluctuations.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, fluctuating slightly quarter to quarter. Profit margins have been relatively consistent, with a slight decline in recent quarters, indicating possible pressure on profitability.  The revenue increase suggests continued strength in the companyâ€™s operational performance, but requires further examination to be certain it is sustained and sustainable.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has generally shown an upward trend. ROE (Return on Equity) has shown significant fluctuations, including a negative value in 2024-03-31.  This requires further analysis to understand the underlying factors.  Further analysis into the causes behind the fluctuation in profitability and return on equity are critical.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UNH has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing consistent positive alpha. However, recent price action suggests a potential downturn. Technical indicators are mixed, with RSI near oversold levels but PPO negative.  Earnings show revenue growth but significant EPS volatility. Financial information reveals relatively stable revenue but fluctuating profitability and ROE.  Additional analysis of the recent earnings news, market outlook and analyst opinions is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of the stock's current position and potential.   The long-term expected return is high, but substantial risk should be considered.  A deeper dive into the causes of the EPS and ROE fluctuations is needed before forming a solid investment thesis.
