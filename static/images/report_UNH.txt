2024-12-12 - Analysis Report
## UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH) is a diversified healthcare company offering a range of health benefits and services.  Over the period analyzed, UNH's cumulative return (161.90%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's return (120.40%). The difference in cumulative return is 41.5%, placing it at the 32.6th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests strong outperformance but also highlights that such a high relative performance is not unprecedented in its historical context.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently positive alpha (between 0.1 and 0.2) across all periods, indicating UNH consistently outperformed the market. The beta values suggest higher than average market sensitivity. However, the relatively high maximum drawdown (MDD) values across several periods signal potential periods of substantial risk. The significant drop in CAGR from 2019 to 2024 indicates a slowdown in growth.  Capitalization has grown steadily over the years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $565.19
* **5-day Moving Average:** $571.71
* **20-day Moving Average:** $591.53
* **60-day Moving Average:** $582.02

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-to-medium term. The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages suggests limited volatility recently.  The Last Market price of $536.36 suggests a recent price jump since the data was collected. This should be investigated further with updated data.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (46.60):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 50), suggesting potential for a price bounce.
* **PPO (-0.95):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -12.3%, indicating recent downward pressure.

The combination of a relatively low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the recent negative relative strength change, points to a bearish short-term outlook.  However, the high expected return of 207.7% over the long term (2+ years) based on current data suggests that this short-term bearish outlook may be overcome.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows inconsistent quarterly performance.  While EPS was high in Q3 2024 and Q4 2023 (6.56 and 6.31 respectively), Q2 2024 showed a significantly lower EPS (4.58).  Q1 2024 shows a negative EPS, suggesting a potential challenge in that quarter. Revenue has generally increased over time, but the growth rate is not consistently high. The lack of comparison to expectations prevents a complete assessment of beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue has shown fairly consistent growth, though the rate is not always high.  
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have generally been strong but experienced some fluctuation in Q1 and Q2 2024.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity has increased overall, but ROE shows significant volatility, dropping to a negative value in Q1 2024. This highlights potential risk and the need for a more thorough financial analysis.

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This information was not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UNH has shown historically strong performance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent price action and some technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend.  Inconsistent quarterly earnings, particularly the negative EPS in Q1 2024 and fluctuating ROE, suggest potential risks.  The high projected long-term return should be viewed cautiously given the recent volatility and requires further investigation to support that conclusion.  Additional information on recent news and analyst opinions would provide a more comprehensive assessment.
