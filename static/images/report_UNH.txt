    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures are high, generally in the 66-81% range, indicating significant potential for loss during downturns.

    *   60-day SMA: \$342.84

*   **Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, the current price (\$330.91) is below the 60-day SMA (\$342.84), suggesting that the longer-term trend might be downwards or sideways.  The recent small price decrease confirms some short-term downward pressure.

*   **RSI:** 50.45 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold).

*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) suggests a strong buy recommendation, potentially contradicting other indicators.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -5.1 (Indicates recent short-term price decline).
*   **Expected Return:** -283.2% (Very negative, indicating a significantly lower return than S&P 500).

*   **Analysis:**  The MRI and Hybrid Signal provide conflicting signals.  The RSI being near 50 is neutral.  The negative Expected Return is a major concern and may indicate a pessimistic long-term outlook. The Recent Divergence Change confirms the short-term downward trend.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**
