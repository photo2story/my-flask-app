2025-12-29 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the UNH stock analysis based on the provided data.

**0) Overview**

Here's a summary of the data and a basic analysis:

**1) Return Rate Comparison (UNH vs. VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** UNH (UnitedHealth Group Inc) - A diversified healthcare company.
*   **UNH Cumulative Return:** -17.298%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 103.210%
*   **Divergence:** -119.3 (Relative Divergence: 6.8)

**Analysis:**

UNH has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. The cumulative return of UNH is negative while VOO has more than doubled.  The divergence of -119.3 indicates a substantial difference in performance. The relative divergence of 6.8 suggests this underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  It's important to investigate *why* UNH is lagging so far behind the market.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows the average annual growth rate over different periods.  Notably, the recent 2023-2025 period shows a significant *decline* of -60.0%.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. The MDD is consistently high, indicating significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the stock's performance relative to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500).  Negative alpha values in recent years suggest underperformance compared to the benchmark. The alpha for 2023-2025 is particularly concerning at -127.0%.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. Beta values fluctuate.  The increase in beta between 2018-2022 suggest the stock became more volatile.
*   **Cap (B):** Market capitalization in Billions. The data shows a decline in market cap for the 2023-2025 period.

**Overall:** The alpha, beta analysis indicates a period of declining performance for UNH. The significantly negative CAGR and Alpha in recent years, combined with high MDD, suggests significant risk and underperformance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 331.83
*   **Previous Close:** 327.58
*   **Change:** 1.3
*   **5-day SMA:** 327.358
*   **20-day SMA:** 330.706
*   **60-day SMA:** 338.8677

**Analysis:**

The stock price shows a slight increase in the last trading session. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are below the 60-day SMA. This *could* suggest a short-term upward trend, but the longer-term trend (60-day SMA) is still above the current price. Further observation is required to determine the trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Market Risk Indicator**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 50.93
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0162
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Dividend_2.21 (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-08)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.3 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -283.7

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 1.0 suggests a generally favorable market environment, *but this is a general market indicator and doesn't specifically address UNH's issues.*
*   RSI of 50.93 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   PPO of -0.0162 suggests a slight downward momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal indicates a buy recommendation, allocating 90% of cash to buying, citing safety and a dividend yield. This signal *contradicts* the negative performance data and should be scrutinized.
*   The negative change in relative divergence (-2.3) over the past 20 days confirms the short-term decline.
*   The *extremely negative* expected return of -283.7% is *highly concerning*. It suggests a very pessimistic outlook for UNH if held long-term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines present a mixed picture:

*   **Positive:** "Prediction: UnitedHealth Group Stock Will Soar in 2026", "UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Stock Price Up 1.3% - Should You Buy?" and "Is Trending Stock UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) a Buy Now?" suggest some positive sentiment and potential for recovery.
*   **Negative/Uncertain:** "UNH Stock In 2026: Bull And Bear Case Scenarios" indicates uncertainty about the future. "Trump Wants Health Insurers to ‘Ease Up and Start Cutting Prices.’ What Does That Mean for UNH Stock in 2026?" introduces potential regulatory headwinds.
*   "UnitedHealth Group (UNH) Stock Today: Weekend Market Close, Fresh Headlines, Analyst Targets, and What to Watch Before Monday’s Open" is a general update.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed, highlighting both potential opportunities and significant risks. The regulatory concerns (Trump's comments) could put pressure on UNH's profitability. It's crucial to read the articles to understand the specific arguments for and against UNH.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.96)
*   **Target Price:** 392.24 (Avg), 440.00 (High), 280.00 (Low)

**Analysis:**

Despite the poor recent performance, analysts, on average, still have a "Buy" rating on UNH. The average target price of 392.24 suggests a potential upside from the current price (331.83). However, the wide range between the high and low target prices (440 vs 280) indicates considerable uncertainty among analysts. The lack of recent rating changes also suggests the current consensus might be outdated and not reflect the recent negative performance.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-10-28 | 2.59 | 113.16 B$ |
| 2025-08-11 | 3.76 | 111.62 B$ |
| 2025-05-07 | 6.9  | 109.58 B$ |
| 2024-11-04 | 6.56 | 100.82 B$ |
| 2025-10-28 | 6.56 | 100.82 B$ |

**Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent with the dates of 2025-10-28 being duplicated for different figures. A simple interpretation of the data shows revenue growth, but the EPS figures are not clearly trending in a single direction. The revenue growth seems promising.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $113.16B   | 18.24%         |
| 2025-06-30   | $111.62B   | 17.93%         |
| 2025-03-31   | $109.58B   | 21.70%         |
| 2024-12-31   | $100.81B   | 21.14%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $100.82B   | 22.84%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity      | ROE   |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| 2025-09-30   | $95.79B   | 2.45% |
| 2025-06-30   | $94.72B   | 3.60% |
| 2025-03-31   | $95.04B   | 6.62% |
| 2024-12-31   | $92.66B   | 5.98% |
| 2024-09-30   | $94.53B   | 6.41% |

**Analysis:**

Revenue is trending upward, which is positive. However, the profit margin has decreased significantly from 22.84% to 18.24%. The Return on Equity (ROE) has also declined substantially. This indicates that while the company is generating more revenue, it is becoming less efficient at converting that revenue into profit and less effective at generating profits from shareholders' equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Poor Performance:** UNH has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Declining Metrics:** CAGR, Alpha, Profit Margin, and ROE have all declined in recent periods, suggesting fundamental problems.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Analyst ratings are still generally positive, but the news highlights both potential upside and regulatory risks. The hybrid signal contrasts the generally negative performance.
*   **Revenue Growth, but at a Cost:** Revenue is growing, but profitability is declining, indicating that the company may be facing cost pressures or pricing challenges.
*   **Highly Concerning Expected Return:** The -283.7% expected return is a major red flag.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data, UNH appears to be a **high-risk investment** at this time. While analysts have a "Buy" rating, the negative performance metrics, mixed news, and extremely negative expected return suggest caution. Further investigation is needed to understand the root causes of the declining profitability and poor stock performance. The analyst consensus may not reflect the reality of the company's recent trajectory.
