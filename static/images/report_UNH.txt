*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility. The MDD is around 80%, implying that investors experienced a significant drop.
*   **Alpha:**  Indicates performance relative to the market.  Negative alpha in several periods (especially recently) means UNH underperformed its expected return based on its beta.

*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap increased from 199.7B to 480.3B, then dropped sharply down to 297.2.

**Analysis:** The historical data suggests a shift in UNH's performance.  Early periods showed strong growth and lower volatility relative to the market. More recently, the company has experienced negative growth, higher volatility (higher beta), and significant underperformance (negative alpha).

*   **60-day SMA:** 340.4105

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below both its 5-day and 60-day SMAs, but slightly below its 20-day SMA. This mixed signal suggests that it has recently dropped, and is now slightly below its medium term average, but still below its longer term average.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk, though it is fairly high in the range.
*   The RSI is close to the neutral point of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The positive change in recent divergence suggests a short-term upward trend.
*   The *extremely* negative expected return is a major red flag. This suggests very poor expectations for future performance relative to the current price.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Themes:** The news headlines consistently highlight the stock's recent price drop (around 34% in 2024), reassessments of valuation, potential for recovery, and analyst discussions about whether the negatives are already priced in. David Tepper selling the stock is also a negative signal.

**Analysis:** The news sentiment is mixed but leaning negative. While some articles suggest the floor may be set for recovery, the overall tone emphasizes concerns about the recent underperformance and valuation. The fact that a major investor is selling shares is a significant concern.

*   **Target Price:** Avg: 392.24 / High: 440.00 / Low: 280.00

**Analysis:** Despite the recent negative performance, analysts maintain a generally positive outlook on UNH with a "Buy" consensus. However, the wide range in target prices (280-440) suggests uncertainty and differing opinions about the company's future potential.
