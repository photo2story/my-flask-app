## Sarepta Therapeutics Inc (SRPT) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:**

Sarepta Therapeutics Inc (SRPT) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for rare neuromuscular diseases.  While showing significant cumulative returns exceeding the S&P 500 in some periods,  recent performance has lagged, exhibiting volatility and a relatively low RSI, suggesting potential caution.  Financial information demonstrates strong profit margins but fluctuating equity and ROE.  Further analysis is needed to determine future investment potential.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SRPT's cumulative return (108.67%) over the analyzed period lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return (121.84%). The current return difference is -13.2%, placing it at the 6.6th percentile of its historical range (relative divergence).

The provided alpha and beta data reveal high volatility and varying performance relative to the market. High positive alpha values in some periods indicate outperformance, while negative alpha in others shows underperformance.  The significantly high beta values (especially in 2015-2017)  suggest high sensitivity to market movements.  This extreme variability underscores the need for a cautious approach.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There are inconsistencies in the data provided (2024-11-06 appears twice), making a conclusive analysis difficult.  Further clarification on the data is needed before meaningful insights can be drawn.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

SRPT exhibits a complex investment profile.  While its high profit margins and potentially oversold conditions (indicated by RSI) might attract investors, its significant price volatility, negative recent price movement, inconsistent earnings data, and substantial swings in ROE raise concerns.  The projected high expected return requires validation and careful consideration of the inherent risk.  Before any investment decision, a thorough due diligence process, including a review of the company's pipeline, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment, is essential.  The provided data alone is insufficient for a definitive investment recommendation.
