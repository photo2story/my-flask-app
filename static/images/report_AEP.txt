## American Electric Power Company Inc (AEP) Stock Review

This report analyzes American Electric Power Company Inc (AEP), a regulated electric utility company operating primarily in the United States.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AEP's cumulative return (68.16%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 108.99%.  The difference is -40.8%, placing it at the 31st percentile of its historical range (max: 36.3%, min: -75.4%). This suggests AEP's performance has lagged behind the broader market over the analyzed period.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 20.0% | 4.5% | -8.0% | 0.0 | 30.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 16.0% | 4.5% | -2.0% | 0.0 | 31.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 43.0% | 4.4% | 12.0% | 0.2 | 41.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 17.0% | 13.0% | -10.0% | 0.3 | 37.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 9.0% | 13.0% | -62.0% | 0.3 | 42.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -19.0% | 13.1% | -27.0% | 0.4 | 46.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 1.0% | 13.1% | -23.0% | 0.7 | 41.2 |
| 2022-2024  | 5.0% | 13.1% | -28.0% | 0.6 | 48.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 21.0% | 8.6% | -29.0% | 0.6 | 56.1 |


While AEP shows periods of outperformance (positive alpha), especially in 2017-2019,  it frequently underperforms (negative alpha),  and a low beta suggests lower volatility compared to the market but also lower potential upside.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has shown a general upward trend.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $105.24
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $106.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $103.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.92

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent downward pressure, but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend in the medium to longer term.  A recent price drop of -2.28% from the previous close is noted.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.53 (slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.0065 (positive, indicating a slightly bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +2.5 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -61.0% (This indicates a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) based on current projections.  This is a critical negative finding and warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions of this prediction.)

The -2.28% price drop from the previous close suggests a minor correction, not a significant crash.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|-------------|------------|
| 2025-02-13 | 1.24   | 1.25         | -0.01      |

| 2024-02-26 | 1.23   | 1.27         | -0.04      |

Earnings have been generally in line with or slightly exceeding expectations, although there is some variability.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of this variability.

Equity is growing steadily, but ROE fluctuates, suggesting potential variations in profitability and efficiency.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

AEP shows mixed signals. While its financials (high profit margins, steady revenue) appear strong, its stock performance has lagged the market significantly over the analyzed period. The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 is a significant concern. The relatively low beta suggests lower volatility, which may be attractive to some investors, but also limits the potential for significant returns.  Further investigation is required into the reasons for the projected long-term underperformance (-61%) against the S&P 500 before making any investment decisions. A comprehensive analysis of the macroeconomic factors influencing the utility sector and AEP's specific competitive landscape is recommended.  The recent earnings have been mostly positive but further analysis of the underlying drivers is necessary.
