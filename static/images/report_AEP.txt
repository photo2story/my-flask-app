The provided data shows varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, and Beta values across different time periods.  Noticeably, recent years (2021-2025) show negative CAGR and increasing Beta, suggesting underperformance compared to the market (higher Beta indicates higher volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations).

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $105.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $102.06

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price drop of -$4.24 (from $109.11) indicates a significant negative change, which needs to be considered alongside the other indicators.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.30 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

* **Expected Return:** -25.5% (This is a significant negative expected return and should be investigated further. The basis for this estimate should be clarified.)

The contradictory signals from the short-term upward trend and the negative price action, along with the high MRI,  suggest a high level of uncertainty and risk.  The significant negative expected return further underlines this concern.

The earnings per share (EPS) figures show some variance between actual and expected values. While some quarters exceeded expectations, others fell short.  A more detailed analysis would require examining the reasons behind these discrepancies.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

AEP's recent performance has been underwhelming compared to the S&P 500.  While historical data shows periods of strong growth, recent years have displayed negative CAGR and increased Beta, indicating underperformance and increased risk. The conflicting signals from technical indicators and the significantly negative expected return (-25.5%) raise significant concerns.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the recent decline in performance and the basis for the projected -25.5% return.  A thorough due diligence, including a review of the company's future projections and industry outlook, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high Market Risk Indicator further reinforces the need for caution.
