## American Electric Power Company Inc (AEP) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

American Electric Power Company Inc (AEP) is a utility holding company operating primarily in the Midwest.  Over the period analyzed, AEP's cumulative return (56.18%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's return (121.09%).  The difference is a negative 64.9%, placing it in the 9.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided Alpha values consistently near zero further support this, suggesting the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements and not by unique company-specific factors.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $98.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $99.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $95.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $95.33

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential support levels.  The slight decrease from the previous close (-$0.02) is not significant enough to indicate a sharp reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.34  (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.)
* **PPO:** 0.45 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but needs to be interpreted in conjunction with other indicators.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.3 (Indicates a short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -268.0% (This extraordinarily negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term is concerning and needs further investigation to determine its validity. The methodology for this calculation is not provided, and such a low return is highly unlikely unless major negative events are anticipated.)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While there's no clear upward or downward trend, it's important to note the discrepancy between the two entries for 2024-11-06. This inconsistency needs clarification.  A more detailed analysis requires consistent and complete data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AEP shows consistent but relatively low growth compared to the broader market (S&P 500).  While it boasts high profit margins and stable revenue, the significantly negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises serious concerns. The provided data contains inconsistencies (duplicate entries for 2024-11-06) that need resolution before forming definitive conclusions.   Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term upward trend, but this needs confirmation with further analysis.  The -268% expected return figure requires critical examination, as it seems unrealistic without significant negative catalysts.  Further investigation into this figure and clarification of the data inconsistencies are crucial before making any investment decisions.
