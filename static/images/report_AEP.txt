**5. Overall Analysis & Summary**

AEP is currently underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO). The negative relative divergence (-23.8%) and declining relative divergence change (-17.0) indicate recent weakness. The high volatility in MDD need to take caution.

Technically, the stock is oversold (RSI of 21.77) and experiencing downward momentum. The recent significant price drop (-3.53) likely reflects negative news or events.

Despite the recent negative performance, the Market Risk Indicator is low (0.3676), and the long-term expected return is a positive 37.5%. This suggests that, while there are short-term headwinds, the stock might present a long-term investment opportunity.

**Recommendation:**

Given the oversold conditions and potential long-term upside, AEP might be considered for a **long-term value investment** if the negative news catalysts are temporary. However, the high volatility and recent underperformance warrant caution and further due diligence regarding the specific factors impacting the company. Monitor upcoming earning reports and company announcements.
