**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AEP's cumulative return (68.35%) underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO)  (89.44%) by 21.1 percentage points.  Considering the historical range of divergence (max: 37.7%, min: -53.9%), AEP's current underperformance is at the 35.8th percentile, indicating it's relatively closer to the lower end of its historical performance range compared to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results. While AEP generally exhibits a beta close to 0.1, suggesting low correlation with the market, the alpha is inconsistent, sometimes positive and sometimes negative, indicating varying degrees of outperformance or underperformance compared to the market.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

AEP's closing price is $108.37.  The stock has seen a recent decline (-0.82) from the previous close of $109.27. The short-term price trends are:

* 5-day moving average: $106.73
* 20-day moving average: $105.22
* 60-day moving average: $101.21

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a relatively positive short-term momentum, although the recent decline indicates some bearish pressure.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Medium Risk).  This suggests a moderate level of risk associated with the stock.
* **RSI:** 68.12, indicating the stock is in slightly overbought territory.
* **PPO:** 0.16, suggesting a positive momentum but not excessively strong.
* **Relative Divergence:**  A positive 5.0 change over 20 days shows short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -17.8%.  This negative expected return is concerning and needs further investigation and context. The provided data lacks the details of the calculation. The projected long-term (2+ years) underperformance against the S&P 500 requires further analysis and clarification.  The statement that it is an "S&P 500 over-performance" seems contradictory to the -17.8% figure.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

AEP's recent earnings show some variability. While a few quarters exceeded expectations (2024-11-06, 2024-07-30), others fell slightly short (2024-02-26, 2025-02-13).  The overall picture is one of relatively consistent earnings, with small fluctuations around expectations.  More comprehensive analysis would require examining further historical data and industry benchmarks.

| 2023-12-31 | $4.58B  | 56.65%        | $25.25B   | 1.33% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

AEP shows a mixed performance. While it enjoys strong profitability and relatively consistent earnings, its return lags behind the S&P 500. The short-term price action is somewhat positive, but the recent decline and slightly overbought RSI suggest caution.  The negative expected return and high MDD in certain periods highlight significant risk. A more in-depth analysis considering broader macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and a longer-term perspective is crucial before making any investment decisions. The contradictory information regarding long-term S&P 500 outperformance versus the given -17.8% expected return warrants further clarification and investigation.
