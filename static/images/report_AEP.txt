### 5. Overall Analysis

AEP is currently showing mixed signals.

*   **Negatives:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 historically and has a very negative long-term expected return. Recent Alpha values are increasingly negative.
*   **Positives:** It exhibits low market risk.  There is a recent, short-term uptick in performance relative to its historical trend.
*   **Neutral/Cautious:** The RSI indicates the stock may be overbought. Recent news suggests significant activity and potential volatility.

**Recommendation:** Given the historical underperformance, negative long-term outlook, and potential for volatility based on recent news, a conservative approach is warranted. The hybrid signal recommends buying a portion, which seems to align with a "hold" or "cautious buy" strategy. If considering a new investment, carefully weigh the potential risks against the short-term positive momentum and low market risk indicator. Closely monitor upcoming news and analyst reports. The negative expected return, though, is a serious concern for long-term investors.
