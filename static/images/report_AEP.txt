* **Closing Price:** $93.63

* **PPO (-0.38):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-1.7):**  Shows a recent short-term decline.

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence indicates bearish sentiment.

The price of $93.63 is not significantly far from the moving averages to suggest any sudden large price movements (rapid increase or decrease).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

While revenue has generally remained above $5B in the most recent quarters (with some fluctuation), EPS shows inconsistency, with a significant drop from $1.91 in Q1 2024 to $0.64 in Q2 2024 followed by a return to a higher EPS in Q3 2024.  Without comparative expectations, it's impossible to label any results as "beats" or "misses."  There's also a duplication of data for 2024-11-06.
