AEP might be suitable for investors seeking stable dividend income and lower market sensitivity. However, investors should be aware of the stock's recent underperformance, potential for continued underperformance relative to the broader market, and the risk of short-term price declines. Given the overbought RSI and negative expected return, a cautious approach is warranted.
