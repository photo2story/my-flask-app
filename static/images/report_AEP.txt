**0. Executive Summary:**

AEP, American Electric Power Company Inc., is a large electric utility holding company.  This report analyzes AEP's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), evaluating its financial health, and offering a forward-looking perspective.  AEP shows relatively stable performance compared to the S&P 500, with slight underperformance in the last period, but a positive expected return in the long term.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

AEP's cumulative return is slightly lower than the S&P 500's.

* **AEP Cumulative Return:** 78.00%

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows variable performance relative to the market (Beta ranging from 0.0 to 0.3, indicating lower volatility than the market, and Alpha varying between -0.1 and 0.3, meaning outperformance in some periods and underperformance in others.)

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $106.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $105.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $103.96

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor downward trend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend in the longer term.  The recent price drop of -$1.04 is a relatively small change, not indicating a dramatic shift in either direction.

While the RSI and 20-day relative divergence suggest a minor downward trend, the PPO indicates positive momentum, and the long-term expected return is positive relative to the S&P 500.  The small price drop of -$1.04 does not suggest a significant immediate trend.
