**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

AEP is underperforming the S&P 500, has shown periods of negative Alpha, and is currently in a short-term downtrend. The RSI indicates it is oversold, but this might not be enough to trigger a rebound. Recent news is mixed, and while the analyst consensus is "Buy," there is a wide range in target prices, with some analysts having very bearish views. The large negative expected return is a significant concern. While AEP's financials show strong profit margins, revenue and ROE have been inconsistent.

**Overall Recommendation:** Based on the data provided, a cautious approach to AEP is warranted. The negative divergence, downtrend, negative expected return, and mixed analyst opinions raise significant concerns. While the oversold RSI might suggest a potential rebound, it is not a strong enough signal to justify a buy recommendation on its own. Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions.
