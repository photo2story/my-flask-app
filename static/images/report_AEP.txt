**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

AEP's cumulative return of 45.22% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return of 114.36% over the analyzed period.  The difference is -69.1%, placing it at the 5.5th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates AEP's underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently shows near zero indicating the stock's return is largely explained by market movements.  The beta, while varying slightly over the years, consistently indicates low to moderate market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.91
* **5-day Moving Average:** $92.03
* **20-day Moving Average:** $95.95
* **60-day Moving Average:** $97.19

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (11.56):**  Indicates the stock is oversold.
* **PPO (-0.64):** Suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day change):**  A positive change of 5.5% suggests short-term upward momentum, counter to the longer-term trends suggested by the moving averages.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The model projects no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  Given the current price of $90.91 is below the moving averages, any potential upward trend is likely to be modest.  A substantial, rapid rebound (sharp increase) or decline would require a significant catalyst.
