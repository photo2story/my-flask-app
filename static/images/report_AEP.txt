*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a buy based on safety and dividend yield. This contrasts with the negative divergence and return forecasts, highlighting conflicting signals.
*   The negative expected return of -103.7% is extremely pessimistic and suggests the model anticipates significant further underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   The market risk indicator is at 0.8 which is a medium investment
