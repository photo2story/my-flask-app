This report analyzes American Electric Power Company Inc. (AEP), a utility holding company that operates electric power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

AEP's cumulative return of 61.19% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 127.58%. The difference is -66.39%, placing it at the 7.34th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates that AEP's underperformance is substantial compared to its historical performance relative to the market index.  The provided Alpha values (ranging from -4.5% to 15.2%) and Beta values (around 0.5-0.6) suggest AEP has had periods of both outperformance and underperformance compared to the market, with generally lower market sensitivity (Beta < 1).  However, the recent underperformance is notable.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $97.59 (Last market: $97.97)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $96.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $98.91

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a slight short-term downtrend.  However, it's above the longer-term 60-day moving average, indicating a potential support level.  The slight difference between the last market price and closing price ($0.38) doesn't indicate a significant immediate price jump or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI:** 50.43 (Neutral)
* **PPO:** 0.4 (Slightly bullish)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -3.1% (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (Long-term S&P 500 relative outperformance expectation is 0%, suggesting neutral expectations based on the provided data).

The RSI is near the neutral level, while the PPO suggests a slightly positive momentum. The negative relative strength change indicates a recent short-term weakening in the stock's performance compared to the S&P 500.  The 0% expected return is a projection and the lack of a margin of error would need more detail for clarification.

To fully assess the performance, comparing actual results to analyst estimates for each quarter (which aren't provided) is crucial.  A clear trend is difficult to ascertain without this context. The data for Nov 6, 2024 appears duplicated.
