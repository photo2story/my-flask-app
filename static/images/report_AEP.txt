AEP presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** AEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The technical indicators suggest the stock may be overbought. Expected Q3 earnings decline and a very negative long-term expected return compared to S&P 500 raise concerns. The lack of recent positive Alpha further reinforces the underperformance issue.

**Conclusion:**

While the analyst consensus and dividend news are encouraging, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative expected return, and overbought RSI warrant caution. Potential investors should weigh the positive dividend aspects against the risks of underperformance. Monitoring upcoming earnings reports and analyst updates will be crucial.
