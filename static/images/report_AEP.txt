**6) Overall Analysis:**

AEP shows mixed performance. While it possesses strong financial fundamentals with high profit margins and growing revenue, its stock price performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500.  The relatively low and volatile ROE is a concern. Technical indicators suggest an overbought condition, potentially indicating a near-term correction.  The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 is a major drawback.  Further research into the reasons for underperformance relative to the market is necessary before considering a long-term investment.  While the company itself appears financially healthy, the investment appeal is currently limited based on the provided data.
