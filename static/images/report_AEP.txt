## American Electric Power Company Inc (AEP) Stock Analysis

**0) Executive Summary:**

American Electric Power Company Inc (AEP) is a US-based electric utility company.  Its recent performance lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO). While showing some positive indicators like improving revenue and profitability,  concerns exist due to its underperformance against the market benchmark and a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AEP's cumulative return (56.70%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (119.91%) over the analyzed period. The relative underperformance, currently at -63.2%, places it in the 10.9th percentile of its historical range of underperformance (-75.4% to 36.2%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While AEP exhibits positive alpha in some periods (suggesting outperformance), it's often accompanied by high maximum drawdowns (MDD). The beta generally stays around 0.6-0.7, indicating moderate sensitivity to market movements.  The consistent high MDD suggests a higher risk profile despite the relatively low beta in certain periods.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 20.0% | 4.4% | -8.0% | 0.1 | 30.5 |
| 2016-2018  | 16.0% | 4.5% | -2.0% | 0.0 | 32.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 43.0% | 4.5% | 12.0% | 0.2 | 42.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 17.0% | 12.9% | -10.0% | 0.3 | 38.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 9.0% | 12.9% | -62.0% | 0.3 | 42.3 |
| 2020-2022  | -19.0% | 13.2% | -27.0% | 0.4 | 46.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 1.0% | 13.2% | -23.0% | 0.7 | 41.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 5.0% | 13.2% | -28.0% | 0.6 | 49.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 10.0% | 8.6% | -51.0% | 0.6 | 52.4 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $98.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $99.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $95.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $95.36

The price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. However, it's below the 5-day moving average, hinting at recent price correction.  The relatively small change from the previous close (+$0.33) doesn't indicate a significant recent price movement (neither a sharp increase nor decrease).


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (66.37):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.31):** Positive, indicating upward momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** Positive change (+2.2), reinforcing short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (-226.4%):** This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant concern and suggests substantial underperformance is anticipated unless market conditions significantly change.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some variability in EPS and revenue.  While the most recent quarter shows higher revenue and EPS compared to Q2, there's no clear consistent upward trend.  Further analysis with a longer time frame is needed to draw robust conclusions.  The duplicated data point for 2024-11-06 needs clarification.

| 날짜       | EPS | 매출       |
|------------|-----|------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8 | $5.42B     |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.64 | $4.58B     |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.91 | $5.03B     |
| 2023-11-02 | 1.83 | $5.34B     |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.83 | $5.34B     |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally maintains a relatively high level. Profit margins are consistently high (above 56%), indicating good profitability. Equity is steadily increasing. ROE, however, shows considerable volatility, suggesting inconsistent profitability in the analysed period.


Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $5.42B | 63.05% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.58B | 62.44% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.03B | 62.33% |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.58B | 56.65% |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.34B | 61.02% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE     |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $26.62B  | 3.61%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $26.14B  | 1.30%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $25.80B  | 3.89%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.25B  | 1.33%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $25.31B  | 3.77%  |


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

AEP exhibits strong profitability and consistent revenue generation. However, its significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and a notably negative expected return raise serious concerns. The high maximum drawdowns throughout various periods indicate a potentially higher risk profile than initially suggested by its beta. While short-term technical indicators suggest some upward momentum, the long-term outlook appears negative based on the provided data.  Further investigation into the causes of underperformance and the reliability of the extremely negative long-term expected return projection are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data point in the earnings data requires clarification.
