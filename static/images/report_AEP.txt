## American Electric Power Company Inc. (AEP) Stock Review

This report analyzes American Electric Power Company Inc. (AEP), a utility holding company that operates electric power generation and distribution facilities.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

AEP's cumulative return (56.21%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (119.94%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -63.7%, placing it in the 10.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data. This indicates AEP's underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently near zero suggests it has not significantly outperformed or underperformed the market, considering the beta (near 0 in the provided data).  Further investigation into the beta's accuracy is needed to completely trust that statement.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $98.05
* **5-day Moving Average:** $99.27
* **20-day Moving Average:** $95.24
* **60-day Moving Average:** $95.33

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it's above both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential support levels.  The recent price change of -$1.95 reflects a recent decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.66 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.64 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.3 (Short-term upward trend)

The RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, hinting at a potential pullback.  The positive PPO reinforces the short-term upward trend indicated by the relative divergence.  However, the significantly negative expected return of -235.6% requires further clarification; a negative expected return isn't inherently meaningful without context on its calculation methodology and assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While there's no clear upward or downward trend, the most recent quarter (2024-11-06) shows higher EPS and revenue compared to some previous quarters.  Note that there's a duplicate entry for 2024-11-06 in the provided data, making it unclear if one is erroneous.  Further investigation is required for a complete analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AEP shows consistent profitability with high margins, but its stock price performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While recent earnings show some strength, the negative expected return requires further investigation and clarification.  The technical indicators offer mixed signals, with the RSI suggesting potential overbought conditions while the PPO indicates bullish momentum.  A more in-depth analysis, including a review of the -235.6% expected return calculation and clarification on the duplicate earnings data entry, is needed before making investment decisions.
