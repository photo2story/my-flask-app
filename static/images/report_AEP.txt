**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of total revenue and gross profit data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This crucial information is needed to assess AEP's overall financial health and growth potential.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AEP has shown a positive but relatively lower return compared to the S&P 500.  While short-term indicators (moving averages, PPO) suggest a potential upward trend, the long-term projected underperformance (-157.2% vs VOO) is a significant concern and requires further examination.  The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) hinders a thorough assessment of the company's fundamental strength.  A more in-depth analysis, including a review of the methodology behind the -157.2% expected return figure and access to complete financial statements, is necessary before drawing definitive conclusions about AEP's investment potential.
