**8. Overall Summary:**

AEP presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, especially in recent years, and a very negative long-term expected return are major concerns. High MDD values indicate elevated risk.
*   **Positives:** Recent positive news sentiment from analysts, strategic partnerships, and strong profit margins are encouraging. Analyst consensus is a "Buy" with a target price above the current price. The recent relative performance improvement is a positive short-term sign. The hybrid signal indicates that it is safe to buy the stock with left over cash for dividend.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the underperformance and negative long-term outlook, caution is advised. While analyst ratings are positive and there are some positive catalysts, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the negative expected return are concerning. AEP might be suitable for dividend-focused investors, but significant capital appreciation may be limited. Further research and monitoring are essential.
