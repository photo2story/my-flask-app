## AEP Stock Analysis

**Company Overview:** AEP (American Electric Power) is a publicly traded electric utility company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.

**1. Performance vs S&P 500:**

AEP's cumulative return of 26.25% significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 89.66%. The current relative divergence stands at -63.41, indicating that AEP's performance is substantially lower than the benchmark index, placing it at the 14.28th percentile of its historical performance range. 

**2. Recent Price Action:**

AEP's current closing price is $100.28. The 5-day moving average is $99.23, the 20-day moving average is $98.17, and the 60-day moving average is $93.32. These figures suggest that AEP's price is currently trending upwards, but a closer look at the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) would provide a more detailed insight into the strength and sustainability of the trend. 

**3. Technical Indicators:**

AEP's RSI of 71.45 suggests that the stock is currently in overbought territory. The PPO of -0.05 indicates a slight bearish momentum, further supporting the notion that the current price action might be nearing its peak. The recent 20-day relative divergence change of -11.85 signals that the stock is experiencing a short-term downward trend. However, the expected return of 21.17% suggests that AEP could still offer potential upside over the long term, particularly for investors employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy. 

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

AEP's most recent earnings report for the quarter ending July 30, 2024, revealed earnings per share (EPS) of $0.64 and revenue of $4.58 billion. This result surpassed analyst expectations of $0.55 EPS and $4.24 billion in revenue. However, it's important to note that a single quarter's earnings do not paint a complete picture of the company's financial health.  Further analysis of AEP's long-term financial performance is crucial to assess its future potential. 

**5. Overall Analysis:**

While the stock's recent price action suggests some upward momentum, technical indicators signal that the stock might be overbought and nearing a potential pullback. The company's latest earnings report exceeded expectations, offering a positive sign for the future.
