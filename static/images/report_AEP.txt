*   Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence: 2.7 (+) Short-term increase
*   Expected Return: -56.7%

*   **Analysis:**

    *   The MRI of 0.5 indicates a "Low Investment Recommended" level of risk.
    *   The RSI of 77.99 suggests the stock is currently overbought and may be due for a correction.
    *   The PPO is positive, indicating that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which is typically a bullish signal.
    *   The "Hybrid Signal" is confusing because it labels the stock "Very Safe" with an MRI of 0.90, which contradicts the overall MRI of 0.5. This suggests conflicting data or a different model being used for the hybrid signal.
    *   Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence of 2.7(+) indicates a short-term increasing divergence, suggesting recent upward momentum.
    *   A concerning point is the extremely negative expected return of -56.7%, suggesting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term (2+ years).

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

    *   AEP secured a $1.6 billion federal loan guarantee for power line upgrades in the Midwest, related to increased data center usage and AI ambitions.

    *   AEP mentioned in an article about a Vanguard Index Fund.

*   **Analysis:** The major positive news is the $1.6 billion federal loan, which will help AEP modernize its infrastructure. This could be a long-term positive catalyst, particularly given the increasing demand for electricity from data centers and AI.

**5. Overall Summary & Recommendation**

AEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While recent news of a $1.6 billion federal loan for infrastructure upgrades is a positive catalyst, several factors raise concerns:

*   **Underperformance:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and negative Alpha values in recent periods.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** A very negative expected return suggests continued underperformance.
*   **Overbought Condition:**  High RSI indicates a potential price correction.
*   **Conflicting Signals:**  The "Hybrid Signal" is confusing and may be based on a different model with a higher risk tolerance.

**Recommendation:** While analysts have a generally positive outlook, the data suggests caution. The stock appears overbought in the short term and has a poor long-term expected return.
