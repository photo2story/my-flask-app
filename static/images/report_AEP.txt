**7. Overall Analysis:**

AEP has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, exhibiting a negative alpha. While some technical indicators (RSI approaching oversold levels) might suggest a short-term bounce, the long-term outlook is bleak considering the substantially negative expected return compared to the market.

More information is needed regarding recent news and analyst sentiment to further refine the assessment.  The highly negative expected return requires careful review to understand how this metric was generated.  Further due diligence including a more thorough examination of AEP's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is recommended before making any investment decisions.
