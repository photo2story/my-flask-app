The difference is a substantial -70.6%, placing it at the 4.3rd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.

* **Expected Return (-612.5%):**  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon is highly unusual and requires further investigation into the source and methodology of this calculation. It's likely flawed or based on unrealistic assumptions.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While there's generally a pattern of higher revenue and EPS in the last quarter of the year, recent quarters show inconsistencies. For example, Q3 2024 revenue is slightly lower than Q1 2024, while EPS increased significantly. A more detailed analysis would require understanding the factors driving these fluctuations, which are not provided in this limited dataset.  Notably, there are duplicated entries for 2024-11-06.

No recent (within the last 2 days) earnings news or analyst opinions are provided.  Information on market outlook is lacking.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While recent technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, the extremely negative long-term expected return is a major concern and needs further clarification.  Earnings data shows some variability but overall maintains consistent profitability.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive assessment.  More information is needed to fully evaluate the current market position and future prospects of AEP. The significant underperformance relative to the market requires a thorough investigation into the underlying factors affecting AEP's performance.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the significant underperformance relative to the market, the volatile earnings, and the concerningly negative projected long-term return, further due diligence is strongly recommended before any investment decision.  A deeper dive into AEP's specific business challenges, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is crucial.  Additionally, the source of the -612.5% expected return figure should be verified and understood.
