**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $105.11
* **Previous Close:** $106.21
* **5-day Moving Average:** $105.80
* **20-day Moving Average:** $105.45
* **60-day Moving Average:** $99.54

The price is slightly below its recent moving averages, suggesting some minor downward pressure.  The negative change from the previous close (-1.04) reflects a minor, recent price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.13 (Slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.24 (Negative; indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.6 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -58.1% (Significant negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term)

The indicators present a mixed picture. The negative PPO and relative divergence suggest bearish momentum.  The negative expected return highlights the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, even in a long-term investment horizon (over 2 years).  The relatively low RSI does not indicate an oversold condition that would be a strong indicator for immediate rebound.
