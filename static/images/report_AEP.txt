**6. Overall Analysis:**

AEP's performance has lagged the broader market (S&P 500) over the given period. While there have been periods of outperformance, as indicated by positive alpha values in some years, the recent years shows significant underperformance. The relatively high and stable profit margins and increasing equity suggest a financially sound company. However, the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 (-63.4%), needs to be investigated further and is a serious concern for long-term investors.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reason for underperformance, including assessment of factors such as regulatory changes, competition, and future growth prospects.  The current price is slightly above the longer-term moving averages, indicating potential short-term support but the negative long-term expected return should be a major consideration.  The provided data is limited and may not be sufficient for a comprehensive investment decision.  A thorough review of future outlook and financial statements is needed.
