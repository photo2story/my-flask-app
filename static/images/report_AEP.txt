**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data were provided, limiting a comprehensive financial analysis.  This absence of crucial financial data significantly hinders a complete assessment of AEP's financial health and future prospects.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AEP's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 considerably over the analyzed period.  While short-term indicators suggest some bullish momentum (moving averages, PPO), the long-term picture appears bearish, especially given the projected negative expected return and the significant underperformance against the S&P 500. The lack of crucial financial data (revenue, gross profit) severely restricts a full evaluation. The reported -157.2% expected return requires further investigation and clarification.  Before making any investment decision, a thorough review of AEP's financials, including revenue, profit margins, and debt levels, is absolutely necessary.  The current data paints a picture of a company that has struggled to keep pace with the market and requires more scrutiny before recommending any investment.
