**Overall Recommendation (Caveat: This is based solely on the provided data):**

The data presents a mixed picture, making a definitive recommendation challenging.

**Bearish Signals:** Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500, negative Alpha, bearish PPO, and a very negative expected return warrant caution.
**Bullish Signals:** The stock being oversold and the buy signals from analysts suggest a buying opportunity. The strong profit margins and the increase in quarterly dividend are positive.

**Cautionary Note:** The extremely negative expected return should be investigated thoroughly before making any investment decisions. It could indicate a significant issue with the company's future prospects or the analysis itself.
