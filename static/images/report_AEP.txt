## American Electric Power Company Inc (AEP) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

AEP, American Electric Power Company Inc, is a US-based electric utility holding company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** AEP: 68.88%, VOO: 118.31%.  AEP underperformed VOO by 49.4 percentage points.  The relative underperformance, considering historical volatility, places it at the 23.3rd percentile (meaning it's significantly below the typical performance relative to VOO).

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided Alpha/Beta data reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO represents the market).  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others, notably 2020-2022, show significant negative alpha.  The Beta consistently hovers around 1 (meaning the stock's price tends to move relatively in line with the overall market), but rises to 0.7 in 2021-2023 suggesting increased sensitivity to market movements in this period. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows steady growth.  Maximum drawdown (MDD) is relatively high.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $105.33
* **5-day Moving Average:** $103.36
* **20-day Moving Average:** $100.26
* **60-day Moving Average:** $95.90

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. The recent price change of $0.94 (from $104.35) indicates a mild upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (79.12):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (0.36):** Positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** The recent 9.4 point increase in relative strength over 20 days is bullish.
* **Expected Return (-89.9%):** This extremely negative expected return, presumably relative to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year horizon, implies significant risk and low projected future returns compared to the market index.  This drastically contrasts with historical data unless this accounts for major market corrections factored into the analysis.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings per share (EPS) data shows some variance between actual and expected EPS. While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., 2024-11-06), others fell short (e.g., 2024-02-26). Overall, there's not a clear upward or downward trend and some volatility in earnings. Further investigation into the reasons for variance is required.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates, and profit margins remain consistently high, ranging from 56.65% to 64.97%.  This suggests a strong level of profitability for the company.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing, but Return on Equity (ROE) shows fluctuation, ranging from 1.30% to 3.89%.  The inconsistency in ROE suggests potential variability in the company's profitability and efficiency in utilizing shareholder's equity.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AEP's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the measured period.  While the company demonstrates strong profitability and consistent revenue, the relatively high MDD, and notably low projected long-term returns relative to the market, raise concerns.  The recent price movement shows an upward trend, supported by some technical indicators, but the overbought RSI suggests caution.  Earnings show some variability.  Considering the negative expected return, a thorough risk assessment is needed before any investment decision is made. Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of the significant underperformance compared to the market and explore the substantial discrepancy between the reported and modeled expected returns.
