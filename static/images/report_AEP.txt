**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AEP's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. The difference (-58.6%) falls within the historical range of underperformance, but places it considerably below the average performance of the S&P 500.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows mixed results.  While CAGR fluctuates, Alphas are mostly positive indicating some outperformance in certain periods, but significantly offset by negative alpha periods. Betas generally hover around 1, suggesting AEP's price movements are relatively correlated with the broader market, although this varies year-to-year.  The consistently high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) point to periods of significant price declines, highlighting a higher risk profile despite relatively low beta in some years.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AEP's recent performance has lagged the S&P 500 considerably.  While some short-term indicators suggest a positive momentum (price above moving averages, positive PPO), the long-term forecast  is extremely negative and requires clarification.  High and volatile MDDs highlight significant risk.  Financials show healthy revenue and profit margins, but the considerable underperformance relative to the broader market is a significant concern.  The projected long-term negative expected return (if accurate) makes a long-term investment decision questionable without further investigation into the model and assumptions used for that projection. More detailed fundamental analysis, including future earnings projections and a thorough evaluation of the -157.2% expected return, is strongly recommended before making any investment decision.  The high profit margins and relatively stable revenue suggest resilience but cannot offset the lagging returns and the extreme negative expected return projection.
