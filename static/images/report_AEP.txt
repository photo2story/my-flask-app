**7. Overall Analysis:**

AEP demonstrates stable financials with high and consistent profit margins. However, its stock performance significantly lags the S&P 500. While the recent price movement suggests a short-term uptrend, the RSI indicates a potential overbought condition. The extremely negative expected return is likely an error and should be disregarded. AEP's performance is heavily influenced by market movements, showing little alpha.  Further investigation is needed to understand the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the error in the expected return calculation.  A thorough due diligence including consideration of industry trends, regulatory changes and future growth prospects is required before any investment decision.
