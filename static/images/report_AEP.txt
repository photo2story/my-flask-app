Okay, let's break down the analysis of American Electric Power (AEP).

**0) Report Structure:**

*   **Simple Numbers:** Raw data will be presented directly.
*   **Simple Analysis:** Basic interpretations of the data.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (AEP vs. VOO):**

*   **Ticker:** AEP
*   **Company Overview:** American Electric Power Company Inc. is a public utility holding company that provides electricity generation, transmission, and distribution services.
*   **AEP Cumulative Return:** 61.24%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.36%
*   **Divergence:** -32.8 (Relative Divergence: 21.4)

**Analysis:**

*   AEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period for which cumulative returns are calculated. The S&P 500's return is nearly double that of AEP.
*   The divergence of -32.8 indicates a substantial difference in performance.  A negative value signifies underperformance.
*   The Relative Divergence of 21.4 suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range (0-100). This might mean that AEP's underperformance compared to VOO could potentially be considered relatively large compared to the past (but this range depends on the actual maximum and minimum values).
