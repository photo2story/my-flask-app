AEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. Its historical Alpha values are largely negative and the expected return percentage is -205.1%. Recent news and analyst opinions are mixed.

*   **Bullish Points:** The consensus analyst rating of "Buy," the rising equity, the high MRI indicator, dividend increases, potential oversold conditions (based on RSI), and positive news headlines offer some hope. The recent increase in relative divergence provides a hint of short-term recovery.

**Conclusion:**

The current situation for AEP is complex and presents conflicting signals. While analysts are generally positive and the company appears fundamentally sound (increasing equity, stable profit margins), the historical underperformance and dire expected return are major red flags.
