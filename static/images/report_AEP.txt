**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, with positive growth in earlier periods but negative growth in more recent periods (2020-2024).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Relatively high MDD values, especially in recent years, indicating significant potential losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative in the recent periods (2019-2025), suggesting that AEP has underperformed relative to its benchmark (taking risk into account). In other words, AEP is not generating excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** Beta is low, and generally positive (ranges from 0.0 to 0.5), indicating that AEP has historically been less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500).  A beta close to zero suggests it's relatively uncorrelated to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap shows fluctuations and is at its highest in the 2023-2025 period.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 118.06

*   **5-day SMA:** 120.46
*   **20-day SMA:** 121.40
*   **60-day SMA:** 116.64

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below both its 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, the price is above the 60-day SMA, indicating a possible longer-term upward trend or consolidation. The small negative change in the last market session doesn't necessarily indicate a strong trend but should be monitored.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 35.78
*   **PPO:** -0.57
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (14 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-11)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -6.0 (단기하락 - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -53.9%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 35.78 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, but it should be considered along with other indicators.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, suggesting a downward trend in momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggest to buy, indicating potential upside based on the underlying algorithms.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence supports the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return of -53.9% is concerning. This suggests that, based on the model, AEP is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the next two years.

*   **Renewable Energy Initiatives and YTD Gain:** Positive sentiment, suggesting potential long-term growth.
*   **Stock Pop:** Indicates a recent positive event that boosted the stock price.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. There are positive headlines about renewable energy initiatives, potential record highs, and dividend increases. However, there's also news of a director selling shares and an equity offering that needs closer scrutiny. It is important to consider that news articles are written at different points in time, with different perspectives.

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~2.36 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 128.56 / 139.00 / 114.00

*   **Mixed Signals:** The technical indicators (RSI, PPO) present a mixed picture. The RSI is approaching oversold, *potentially* indicating a buying opportunity, but the negative PPO suggests downward momentum.
*   **Negative Outlook:** The significantly negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting potential for continued underperformance. The recent (20 days) divergence change is also negative.
*   **Conflicting Information:** Analyst ratings are generally positive ("Buy"), but the provided model predicts significant underperformance. News headlines offer both positive and negative perspectives.
*   **Financial Health:** Revenue and profit margins appear healthy.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative expected return, mixed technical signals, and conflicting news and analyst opinions, caution is advised. A deeper dive into the reasons behind the negative expected return and the recent decline in stock price is warranted before making any investment decisions. The equity offering and director's share sale also warrant further investigation. Consider the hybrid signal for a potential long-term buy recommendation.
