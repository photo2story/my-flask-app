2025-12-23 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive report on American Electric Power (AEP) based on the data provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **AEP Overview:** American Electric Power (AEP) is a major investor-owned electric public utility holding company.
*   **AEP Cumulative Return:** 55.997%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 100.884%
*   **Divergence:** -44.9%
*   **Relative Divergence:** 7.4%

**Analysis:** AEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The divergence of -44.9% means that, had you invested in AEP instead of the S&P 500, you would have a 44.9% lower return. The relative divergence of 7.4% suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range, implying the underperformance *could* be nearing a potential bottom (though it doesn't guarantee a reversal).

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 25.0% | 65.9% | -3.0% | -0.0 | 39.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 16.0% | 70.5% | 1.0% | 0.0 | 40.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 33.0% | 70.5% | 11.0% | 0.1 | 50.6 |
| 2018-2020  | 36.0% | 80.2% | 12.0% | 0.1 | 44.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 24.0% | 80.2% | -23.0% | 0.3 | 47.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -5.0% | 80.3% | -5.0% | 0.5 | 50.9 |
| 2021-2023  | -16.0% | 80.3% | -17.0% | 0.4 | 43.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -12.0% | 80.3% | -32.0% | 0.4 | 49.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 12.0% | 75.2% | -53.0% | 0.3 | 61.4 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR has fluctuated significantly. The recent negative CAGR values reflect recent poor performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD figures (65.9%~80.3%) indicate significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** AEP's Alpha is largely negative, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.  The negative Alpha indicates AEP has consistently delivered lower returns than expected given its risk profile.
*   **Beta:** AEP's Beta is low (between 0.0 to 0.5). This implies that AEP is less volatile than the market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** The market cap fluctuates, reflecting overall market conditions and company performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 114.49
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 114.62, Previous Close: 114.49, Change: 0.11
*   **5-day SMA:** 115.024
*   **20-day SMA:** 117.5892
*   **60-day SMA:** 118.13

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This suggests a short-term and mid-term downtrend. The last market data shows a slight price increase, but it's not significant enough to reverse the existing trend.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 27.94 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.27 (Negative, suggesting a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (14 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.3 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return:** -205.1% (Negative, indicating a potentially poor long-term investment based on current conditions)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI value of 27.94 suggests the stock is oversold and *might* be due for a bounce. However, oversold conditions can persist for extended periods.
*   The PPO being negative supports the existing downtrend.
*   The MRI is in the "Medium Investment" range, suggesting a moderate level of risk.
*   The Hybrid Signal is a strong "Buy," indicating a potentially good entry point.
*   The "Short-term rise" in the relative divergence change suggests the stock may begin a reversal.
*   The dramatically negative Expected Return is concerning and contradicts the MRI and Hybrid Signal. This needs careful consideration. It implies that the model used to calculate expected return predicts significant further underperformance relative to the S&P 500. This could be due to various factors not immediately apparent.

*   **Opinions:** 18
*   **Target Price:** Average: 128.97, High: 139.00, Low: 107.00

**Analysis:**  Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating on the stock and believe it is undervalued. The average target price of $128.97 suggests a significant upside potential from the current price of around $114. The range of target prices indicates some disagreement among analysts.
