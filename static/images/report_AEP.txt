**1. Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** American Electric Power Company Inc. is a major investor-owned electric public utility holding company.
*   **AEP Cumulative Return:** 58.03%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -44.18% (AEP underperformed VOO by 44.18% over the period).
*   **Relative Divergence:** 6.6 (AEP's divergence is near the minimum of its historical range relative to VOO).

| 2023-2025  | 14.0% | 75.2% | -52.0% | 0.3  | 62.1   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Varies significantly, showing periods of strong growth followed by declines.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD figures suggest significant volatility and potential for large losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Predominantly negative Alpha values indicate that AEP has generally underperformed its benchmark risk-adjusted return.
*   **Beta:** Low Beta values (close to 0 or less than 1) suggest AEP is less volatile than the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization fluctuates, indicating changes in the company's overall value.
*   **Analysis:** The table paints a mixed picture. While AEP has demonstrated periods of strong growth, the negative Alpha values and high MDD indicate that the stock may not consistently deliver superior risk-adjusted returns.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **20-day SMA:** 115.6987
*   **60-day SMA:** 118.4492

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is slightly up from the previous close.  The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are very close together and below the current price, which suggests a short-term upward trend. However, the 60-day SMA is higher, indicating that the longer-term trend may still be downward or sideways.

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.6 (Indicates a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -236.5 (Expected negative excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation.
    *   The neutral RSI indicates a balanced buying and selling pressure.
    *   The negative relative divergence change reinforces the short-term downward trend.
    *   The significantly negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting that analysts anticipate AEP to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

AEP presents a mixed investment case.

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, predominantly negative Alpha values, high Maximum Drawdown, a recent short-term decline, and a very negative Expected Return are concerning. Insider selling is also a potential red flag.
*   **Positives:** A "Buy" analyst consensus and a higher target price suggest potential upside. An increase dividend may make AEP an attractive pick. The stock is showing stability.
*   **Overall:** The negative signals are currently stronger than the positive ones. AEP's recent underperformance, combined with the negative expected return, suggest caution. While analysts see potential upside, a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the underperformance and the company's future plans is crucial before considering an investment. Investigate the reason why the expected return compared to the S&P 500 is so bad. Consider it medium safe but with negative growth potential for long-term investment.
