## American Electric Power Company Inc (AEP) Stock Review

This report analyzes American Electric Power Company Inc (AEP), a leading electric utility company in the United States, based on provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AEP's cumulative return (56.70%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 119.91%.  The current lag is -63.2%, placing it at the 10.9th percentile of its historical range (min: -75.4%, max: 36.2%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed performance. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates, Alpha is mostly positive (except 2015-2017), indicating AEP outperformed the market in some periods.  Beta generally hovers around 0.6, suggesting moderate market sensitivity.  However, the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values, particularly in 2019-2021, highlight significant risk.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2018-2020  | 17.0% | 12.9% | -10.0% | 0.3 | 38.2 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $98.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $99.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $95.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $95.36

The price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, it's below the 5-day average, indicating recent minor price correction.  The small positive change from the previous close ($0.33) is not significant.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 66.37 –  Indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.31 – Suggests a bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.2 – Short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -226.4% – This extremely negative figure suggests a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This needs further investigation as such a large negative number is unusual.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There is no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent.  Note that there are duplicate entries for 2024-11-06.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8 | 5.42 B$ |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.64 | 4.58 B$ |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.91 | 5.03 B$ |
| 2023-11-02 | 1.83 | 5.34 B$ |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.83 | 5.34 B$ |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively stable, while profit margins are consistently high (above 60% except for one quarter) showing good profitability. Equity is steadily increasing, but ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, suggesting inconsistent profitability.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $5.42B | 63.05% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.58B | 62.44% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.03B | 62.33% |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.58B | 56.65% |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.34B | 61.02% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $26.62B | 3.61% |
| 2024-06-30 | $26.14B | 1.30% |
| 2024-03-31 | $25.80B | 3.89% |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.25B | 1.33% |
| 2023-09-30 | $25.31B | 3.77% |


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

AEP's performance has been inconsistent, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 in the long run, as indicated by the large negative expected return. While profitability metrics are strong, the high MDD and volatile Alpha/Beta values highlight substantial risk. The relatively high RSI suggests caution, while the price movement shows a recent minor correction.  The -226.4% expected return requires further investigation and clarification.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough review of the -226.4% projected return is critical, along with a comprehensive analysis of the company's long-term growth prospects and industry dynamics.  The data provided needs further clarification on the duplicate earnings entry and the unusually low expected return.
