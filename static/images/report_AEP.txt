AEP's cumulative return of 64.99% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return of 128.86%.  The difference is -63.9%, placing it in the 9.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's minimum and maximum divergence.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $96.6
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $98.84

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a period of consolidation, not strong momentum.

* **PPO (0.61):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+0.7):**  Shows recent short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return is 0%, indicating no significant long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated based on the provided data.  This should be viewed cautiously as 0% expected return likely doesn't account for market risks.

The closing price of $99.9 is very close to the last market price, hence neither a sharp uptrend nor a sharp downtrend is evident.

* **EPS:**  Fluctuates significantly, ranging from $0.64 to $1.91. No clear trend is discernible.

**Analysis of reported figures:** There is no consistent trend of increasing EPS or revenue in the data provided.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows a steady increase and ROE fluctuates, indicating varying profitability. The ROE data shows relatively lower returns compared to the high profit margins suggesting potentially high operating costs or other factors influencing Return on Equity.  Further analysis is needed to ascertain profitability trends and potential underlying reasons.
