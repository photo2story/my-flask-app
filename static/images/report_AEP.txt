Recent price movements indicate short-term potential for upside, but the stock is still below key moving averages suggesting potential bearish sentiment. Technical indicators suggest overbought conditions and potential for a correction. Recent earnings have been disappointing, further contributing to the bearish sentiment. While the long-term outlook remains positive with a high expected return, investors should exercise caution and monitor the stock's short-term performance closely.
