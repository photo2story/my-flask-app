American Electric Power Company Inc. is an electric utility company that generates, transmits, and distributes electricity.  While AEP has shown a cumulative return of 59.10%, it significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a 120.63% return.

This suggests a period of underperformance compared to the broader market.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  While alpha is positive in some periods (indicating outperformance relative to the market), it's largely negative or near zero, pointing to frequent underperformance. Beta values are consistently high (above 0.1), suggesting significant market sensitivity. The large market cap indicates a relatively large and established company.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 20.0% | 4.4% | -8.0% | 0.1 | 30.5 |
| 2016-2018  | 16.0% | 4.5% | -2.0% | 0.0 | 32.1 |
| 2017-2019  | 43.0% | 4.5% | 12.0% | 0.2 | 41.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 17.0% | 12.9% | -10.0% | 0.3 | 38.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 9.0% | 12.9% | -62.0% | 0.3 | 42.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -19.0% | 13.2% | -27.0% | 0.4 | 46.6 |
| 2021-2023  | 1.0% | 13.2% | -23.0% | 0.7 | 41.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 5.0% | 13.2% | -28.0% | 0.6 | 49.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of $100.17 shows a slight decrease from the previous close.  The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum,  but below the 60-day moving average which suggests a longer term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 60.35 indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The PPO of 0.13 suggests some upward momentum. The recent 20-day relative divergence of 3.1% confirms a short-term upward trend.  The small price change (-$0.20) does not indicate a significant price jump or drop. The expected return of -194% is extremely negative and likely unrealistic.  This figure needs further clarification or reevaluation.  The extremely negative expected return likely reflects the significantly underperformance against the S&P 500. The statement regarding long-term investment needs further explanation on the basis of the -194% figure.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings show some fluctuation but generally remain strong.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8  | $5.42B     |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.64 | $4.58B     |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.91 | $5.03B     |
| 2023-11-02 | 1.83 | $5.34B     |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.83 | $5.34B     |

There is a noticeable inconsistency with two entries for 2024-11-06.  This requires clarification.  Overall, the data suggests relatively consistent revenue, but EPS shows variability.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively stable, with profit margins consistently high (above 56%).  Equity has been steadily increasing, although ROE fluctuates, suggesting periods of higher and lower profitability.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $5.42B | 63.05% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.58B | 62.44% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.03B | 62.33% |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.58B | 56.65% |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.34B | 61.02% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $26.62B | 3.61% |
| 2024-06-30 | $26.14B | 1.30% |
| 2024-03-31 | $25.80B | 3.89% |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.25B | 1.33% |
| 2023-09-30 | $25.31B | 3.77% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AEP shows solid financial performance with consistently high profit margins and growing equity. However, its stock price performance significantly lags the S&P 500, indicating underperformance.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity. While recent indicators show short-term upward momentum, the long-term outlook remains uncertain given the historical underperformance against the market and the need to clarify inconsistencies in the data provided (especially the -194% expected return and duplicate entries in the earnings data).  Further investigation is required to fully assess the investment potential of AEP.  The provided -194% expected return is highly suspect and needs clarification before any conclusions can be drawn regarding long-term investment strategy relative to the S&P 500.
