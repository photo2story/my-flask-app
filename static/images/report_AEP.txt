**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

AEP's cumulative return is 50.55%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 112.74%.  The difference is -62.2%, placing it in the 11.8th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on provided data. This indicates AEP has consistently underperformed the broader market over the period considered.  The provided Alpha values consistently near zero further support this underperformance relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.50
* **5-day Moving Average:** $93.06
* **20-day Moving Average:** $92.25
* **60-day Moving Average:** $95.39

The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term correction from a higher price point.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.45 –  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO:** 0.50 – A positive PPO suggests potential upward momentum, though it is relatively weak.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** +10.3% – This shows short-term upward movement, consistent with the moving averages.
* **Expected Return:** -202.4% – This extremely negative figure suggests a significant predicted underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), if current trends hold.  This requires careful consideration and potentially a deeper dive into the underlying assumptions.  A negative expected return would suggest that investors are unlikely to outperform the market.  Further analysis and clarification is needed to understand this significant negative expected return, and this prediction should be treated with caution.
