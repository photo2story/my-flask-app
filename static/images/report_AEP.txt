* **60-day Moving Average:** $103.69

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The recent price drop of $2.02 (from $107.71 to $105.53) needs further investigation to determine the cause.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AEP exhibits strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500,  with a consistently high profit margin. While recent price action shows a slight dip, the longer-term trend appears positive, supported by positive technical indicators and a high projected long-term return.  The recent earnings report shows some volatility, but overall earnings remain healthy.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons behind the fluctuations in revenue, profit margin, ROE, and the significant jump in EPS during November 2024.  Despite the recent price drop, the long-term outlook for AEP remains positive, particularly for investors with a long-term investment horizon.  However, given the increased Beta, investors should consider the increased market sensitivity.
