### 5. Overall Analysis

AEP has underperformed the S&P 500 based on cumulative returns, and the recent alpha figures confirm this underperformance. The decreasing CAGR and relatively high MDD values should be considered carefully. Recent news suggests potential volatility and significant events influencing the stock.

Technically, the RSI is nearing oversold territory, but the PPO indicates a continued downtrend. The 5-day and 20-day moving averages are above the current price, suggesting potential resistance. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a low-risk environment currently.

Despite the recent underperformance and negative trends, the projected long-term expected return is positive. This suggests that AEP may be undervalued and could potentially outperform the S&P 500 over a longer investment horizon.

**Recommendation:** Given the mixed signals, potential investors should closely monitor upcoming news, earnings reports, and company announcements. AEP might be a suitable investment for those seeking long-term value with a potential for outperformance, but caution and due diligence are advised given the recent negative trends and volatility.
