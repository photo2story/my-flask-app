**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

American Electric Power Company Inc (AEP) is a US-based electric utility holding company.  The cumulative return for AEP is 50.62%, significantly lagging the S&P 500's cumulative return of 112.47%. This represents a difference of -61.9%, placing it at the 12.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $92.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $95.48

The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent slight upward trend but potentially some price consolidation or minor downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 66.77 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.41 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +7.0% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -196.2% (This is a strikingly negative figure, indicating a substantially lower expected return than the S&P 500 over the long term, and requires further investigation.  The methodology behind this calculation needs to be clarified.)


The current price of $94.54 doesn't reflect a significant recent sharp jump or drop, but given the negative long-term expected return, it's crucial to understand the factors contributing to this projection.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AEP's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, with a substantial negative return relative to the market index. While recent earnings and revenue figures show some strength, the high RSI suggests potential overvaluation in the short term.  The extremely negative long-term expected return (-196.2%) is a major red flag and needs critical review of the methodology used to arrive at this conclusion.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this projection, including sector-specific factors and potential risks.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence is essential, including examining the company's long-term growth prospects, regulatory environment, and competitive landscape.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) also highlight the importance of verifying data accuracy from reliable sources.
