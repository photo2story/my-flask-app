**6) Overall Conclusion:**

AEP shows a history of strong profitability and consistent revenue. However, its recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. While the medium-term outlook appears positive given the current price position relative to moving averages,  the high MDD highlights significant risk.  The projected 10.6% excess return over the long term is positive, but careful consideration should be given to the recent negative alpha and the variability in key financial metrics like ROE and revenue.  Further in-depth analysis of the drivers behind these variations is recommended before making any investment decisions.
