**7. Overall Analysis:**

AEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, showing a substantial negative divergence (-73.6%). While the company shows consistent and strong profitability, revenue growth is somewhat inconsistent.  The RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, but other indicators point towards a bearish trend.  Technical analysis points to a potential downward trend.  Missing information on recent news and analyst opinions hinders a more comprehensive evaluation.  The extremely negative expected return figure requires clarification and should be verified.

Based on the available data, AEP presents a mixed picture.  Its strong profitability and relatively stable profit margins are positives. However, underperformance against the market and the current price trend below moving averages raise concerns. Further investigation into the expected return calculation, recent news, and analyst sentiments is crucial before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The lack of clear revenue growth trends also warrants further consideration.
