    | 2023-2025  | 14.0%   | 75.2%   | -50.0%  | 0.3   | 61.9   |

    *   **CAGR:** Shows fluctuating annual growth rates, with recent years showing negative returns.
    *   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative in recent years, showing underperformance relative to its benchmark (S&P 500).
    *   **Beta:** Beta is low, generally below 0.5, suggesting low volatility relative to the market. However, given negative alpha, this lower volatility doesn't translate to better risk-adjusted returns.
    *   **Cap(B):**  Shows the company's market capitalization in billions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   Current Close: 115.58
*   Last Market Change: +0.76
*   5-day SMA: 114.95
*   20-day SMA: 117.91
*   60-day SMA: 118.02

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is also below the 20-day SMA, reinforcing this trend. The slight increase in the last market suggests a potential rebound, but this needs to be confirmed by further price action.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 21.50 (Oversold)
*   PPO: -0.3185
*   Hybrid Signal: 100% Buy (Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   Recent Relative Divergence Change: -0.9 (Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return: -166.8%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The RSI of 21.50 indicates the stock is currently oversold, which could suggest a potential buying opportunity for short-term traders.
    *   The PPO is negative, confirming the downtrend.
    *   The Hybrid Signal indicates a buy, which seems to contradict the divergence change and expected return data. The MRI of 0.90 is the hybrid signal's MRI as of 2025-11-11.
    *   The -166.8% expected return is a very concerning figure, suggesting significant potential downside risk.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Coverage:** Some analysts (Siebert Williams Shank, JPMorgan) have initiated or updated coverage, with JPMorgan lifting the price target.
*   **Valuation Reassessment:** Simplywall.st is reassessing AEP's valuation following a recent share price pullback. This indicates potential concerns about the current price.
*   **Dividend Increase:** AEP increased its quarterly dividend, which is generally a positive sign for investors.
*   **Outperforming Dow?:** Yahoo Finance asks the question of AEP outperforming the Dow, indicating a potential recent performance discrepancy.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   Consensus: Buy (Mean of 2.30)
*   Target Price: Average $128.97 (High $139.00, Low $107.00)

*   **Analysis:** While the consensus is a "Buy" with a decent average target price, it's important to note that the expected return suggests analysts may be too optimistic or that they are estimating for a longer time-frame. Reviewing the rationale behind these ratings is crucial.

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has been fluctuating, with the most recent quarter showing the highest revenue in the provided data. Profit margins remain relatively high and consistent. Equity has been increasing, which is a positive sign for the company's financial health. However, ROE has been variable and is not exceptionally high, indicating a need for improved efficiency in generating profits from equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Underperformance:** AEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial divergence in cumulative returns.
*   **Downtrend:** Recent stock price action suggests a short-term downtrend, with the price below key moving averages.
*   **Oversold:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, potentially presenting a short-term trading opportunity.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The "Buy" hybrid signal based on MRI:0.90 (from 2025-11-11) contradicts the negative expected return and short-term decline divergence change. It's unclear whether this is a data error or a reflection of changing market conditions.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analyst ratings are generally positive, but need to be validated with recent financials and expectations.
*   **News & Events:** News suggests a mix of potential valuation concerns and some positive developments (dividend increase, analyst coverage).
*   **Financial Health:** Profitability remains relatively stable, equity is growing, but ROE requires improvement.

**Conclusion:**

AEP presents a complex picture. While analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, the data indicates a concerning negative expected return, underperformance compared to the S&P 500, and a recent downtrend. The conflicting signals from the "Buy" hybrid signal warrants further investigation.

**Recommendation:**

A more in-depth analysis is required before making an investment decision. Factors to consider:

*   **Reason for Negative Expected Return:**  Understand the drivers behind the extremely negative expected return figure.
*   **Analyst Rationale:** Scrutinize the reasoning behind the "Buy" ratings from analysts.
*   **Industry Outlook:**  Assess the overall outlook for the electric utilities industry.
*   **Company-Specific Challenges:**  Identify any company-specific challenges or opportunities.
*   **Risk Tolerance:**  Consider your personal risk tolerance, given the high MDD and the underperformance compared to the broader market.
