**Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 25.0% | 65.9% | -3.0% | -0.0 | 39.4   |

| 2017-2019  | 33.0% | 70.5% | 11.0% | 0.1  | 50.6   |
| 2018-2020  | 36.0% | 80.2% | 12.0% | 0.1  | 44.6   |
| 2019-2021  | 24.0% | 80.2% | -23.0% | 0.3  | 47.6   |
| 2020-2022  | -5.0% | 80.3% | -5.0%  | 0.5  | 50.8   |
| 2021-2023  | -16.0% | 80.3% | -17.0% | 0.4  | 43.5   |

| 2023-2025  | 12.0% | 75.2% | -53.0% | 0.3  | 61.3   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR was strong in earlier periods (2017-2020), but has declined and even turned negative in more recent periods (2020-2024). This indicates a significant slowdown in growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values (65.9% to 80.3%) suggest significant price volatility and potential for large losses over the specified periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is consistently negative in the later periods (2019-2025), and massively negative in the last period. This means AEP is significantly underperforming its benchmark (risk-adjusted) over this timeframe.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are low, ranging from -0 to 0.5. This indicates AEP has generally low volatility relative to the overall market. The increase in Beta over time suggest AEP is becoming increasingly volatile, and more sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** The capitalization has been generally stable over the years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close: 114.49
*   Previous Close: 115.58
*   Change: -0.94
*   5-day SMA: 115.024
*   20-day SMA: 117.5892
*   60-day SMA: 118.13

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day simple moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.
*   The recent negative change indicates continued downward price pressure.
*   The small negative change {'price': 114.49, 'previousClose': 115.58, 'change': -0.94} means that a sharp drop is not happening (sharp rebound, sharp decline).

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   MRI (Market Risk Indicator): 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 27.94
*   PPO: -0.27
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (14 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -0.9 (Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return (%): -166.8%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 27.94 indicates the stock is approaching oversold conditions, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity if you believe in a price reversal.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO (-0.27) suggests the stock price is below its moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal of "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" with a "Very Safe" rating (MRI: 0.90) is *contradictory* to the other data points. This signal should be carefully scrutinized, as it may be an anomaly or based on different underlying calculations. It's advising to buy, allocating all cash, and deems it "Very Safe" *despite* the negative trends.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative value confirms the short-term downward trend, as AEP further underperforms its benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:**  A dramatically negative expected return of -166.8% is highly concerning. It suggests the model anticipates significant further underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a longer investment horizon (2+ years).

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive:**
    *   "American Electric Power: Unmatched Reach Make It A Buy" (Seeking Alpha):  A bullish article suggesting AEP's market position makes it a good investment.
    *   "Scotiabank Issues Positive Forecast for American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) Stock Price" (MarketBeat)
    *   "Why American Electric Power Stock Just Popped" (The Motley Fool)

    *   "AEP Increases Quarterly Dividend to 95 Cents a Share" (PR Newswire): Positive news for investors seeking income.
*   **Negative:**
    *   "UBS Lowers Price Target for AEP to $107 While Maintaining 'Sell' Rating" (GuruFocus): A bearish signal, indicating an analyst believes the stock is overvalued.

**Analysis:** News sentiment is mixed. While some articles suggest positive prospects based on market reach, valuation reassessment, and dividend increases, a key negative signal comes from UBS lowering its price target and maintaining a "Sell" rating. This highlights the divergence in analyst opinions.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   Consensus: Buy
*   Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell): 2.30 (~Buy)
*   Opinions: 18
*   Target Price (avg/high/low): 128.97 / 139.00 / 107.00

**Analysis:**

*   The analyst consensus is a "Buy" with a mean rating of 2.30.
*   However, the wide range in target prices (from 107 to 139) suggests a lack of strong conviction among analysts and potential disagreement on the stock's future value. This confirms the opinions in the news headlines.

|--------------|-----------|-------|
| 2025-09-30   | $30.39B   | 3.20% |

**Analysis:**

*   Equity has been steadily increasing, indicating a strengthening financial position.
*   ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated, with a relatively high point in 2025-06-30, but otherwise remaining relatively stable. These ROE percentages are moderate, reflecting the regulated nature of the utility business.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

AEP presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative Alpha, recent price downtrend (below SMAs), and a dramatically negative *expected return* are major concerns.  The UBS "Sell" rating adds to the negative sentiment.
*   **Positives:** Analyst consensus is "Buy," increasing revenue, high-profit margins, increasing equity, and recent positive news articles suggest some potential upside. AEP is a utility company with a huge reach and has been consistently paying good dividents.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The "Very Safe" hybrid signal contradicts the negative price trends and expected return. This warrants further investigation.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Due to AEP's negative Alpha, negative expected return, downward trend, I would advise caution before considering investment in AEP stock. The positive analyst ratings and recent positive news articles suggest a mixed market sentiment, but the strong negative signals in the technical and performance data outweigh the positives.
