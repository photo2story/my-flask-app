The difference is -68.5%, placing it at the 1.6th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max range).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $95.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $96.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $96.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $98.11

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (42.96):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so.
* **PPO (-0.24):** Suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent decline of -2.6% in relative strength indicates short-term weakness.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% suggests no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated over the long term (2+ years) based on the current data.  The provided figure is a relative metric against the S&P500 and this analysis would need additional information to provide a solid estimate of overall expected return.  The $95.1 closing price doesn't trigger any 
indication of sudden, significant upward or downward movement based on the provided data alone.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue fluctuated quarter to quarter, a strong fourth quarter (2024-11-06) followed a comparatively weaker third quarter.  EPS likewise fluctuates, with a high of $1.91 in Q1 2024, followed by a lower figure in Q2 2024. Comparing directly reported figures, there aren't enough data points to definitively establish clear trends, though there's indication that a high-revenue, high-EPS figure may be seen around Q1 or Q4.  It's impossible to assess "beats" or "misses" without knowledge of analyst expectations.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation, but generally demonstrates stability within the range of $4.5B to $5.4B over the provided period.
* **Profit Margin:** Remained relatively stable, hovering around 62% with a dip in Q4 2023 and showing an improvement in Q3 2024.
* **Equity:** Shows a steady increase over the provided period.
* **ROE:**  Is volatile, fluctuating between approximately 1% and 4% across the quarters. This volatility should be investigated further.

Overall, the financial data suggests a relatively stable, though not exceptionally high-growth, company.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, exhibiting lower returns and a negative alpha. While recent earnings show some volatility, the company appears relatively financially stable. Short-term price action suggests a downward trend. Technical indicators point towards potentially oversold conditions, but don't give a strong buy signal. The provided expected return is 0% compared to the S&P 500, indicating that AEP may not outperform the broader market.  More information is needed on recent news and analyst sentiment to provide a more complete picture.  Further investigation into the reasons for AEP's underperformance is needed to assess future potential.  The high volatility in ROE merits further consideration.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Based solely on the provided data, a neutral stance is suggested.  Further investigation is needed into the causes of recent underperformance, especially given the comparatively stable revenue and profit margin numbers. Additional data on news, analyst sentiment, and a more in-depth analysis of the ROE volatility are needed before offering a definitive buy or sell recommendation.  The provided 0% expected return, relative to the S&P 500, should be critically evaluated given the potential inherent risks and limitations of this specific relative measure.
