*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, generally above 65%, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Negative alpha values in several periods, especially recently, suggest AEP has underperformed its benchmark *after* adjusting for risk. The most recent period shows a particularly poor alpha of -52.0%.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low (close to zero), indicating that AEP's price movements are relatively independent of the broader market (S&P 500). However, the beta has been trending higher in more recent periods.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization remains relatively stable across the different timeframes.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close Price: 115.99
*   Previous Close: 115.77
*   Change: 0.19
*   5-day SMA: 115.578
*   20-day SMA: 115.6987
*   60-day SMA: 118.4492

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a minor short-term upward trend. However, the 60-day SMA is significantly higher, indicating that the price is currently below its medium-term average. The recent "change" value of 0.19 implies a minor fluctuation.

**3) RSI, PPO, Market Risk Indicator, Hybrid Signal, and Expected Return**

*   MRI: 0.9 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 49.53 (Neutral)
*   PPO: 0.1538
*   Hybrid Signal: Buy 100% (Very Safe)
*   Recent Relative Divergence Change: -4.6 (Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return: -236.5%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The Medium Investment recommendation suggests that, based on the model's risk assessment, AEP is currently considered moderately suitable for investment.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI around 50 indicates a neutral momentum, with neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests that the shorter moving average is above the longer moving average, hinting at an uptrend. However, the magnitude of 0.1538 is relatively small.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100%" signal with a "Very Safe" label is contradictory given the previous negative indicators. This could reflect a focus on downside protection.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative value signals recent underperformance relative to the comparison stock.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests the model anticipates significant future underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  This is a very concerning indicator.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Performance Concerns:** AEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with negative alpha indicating risk-adjusted underperformance. The negative expected return is alarming.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The "Buy" hybrid signal and positive analyst consensus contradict other indicators suggesting caution.

**Conclusion:**

The data paints a mixed picture of AEP. While analyst opinions are positive and the MRI suggests a medium-risk investment, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative alpha, and alarming negative expected return are major red flags. The low Beta means AEP is not correlated with the overall market's volatility. Investors should carefully weigh these conflicting signals, investigate the reasons behind the negative performance metrics, and consider their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. The recent news articles also provide conflicting viewpoints, making thorough due diligence even more critical.
