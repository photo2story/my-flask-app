While the CAGR fluctuates, the Beta consistently hovers around 0.3, suggesting a relatively low correlation with the overall market. Alpha varies significantly, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance compared to the market. The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) points to a relatively high risk profile.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: 106.70
* 5-Day Moving Average: 107.02
* 20-Day Moving Average: 105.92
* 60-Day Moving Average: 104.09

The stock price is currently slightly below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a more positive longer-term trend.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.53 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.1461 (Slightly positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but weak)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -9.6% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 10.6% (Long-term S&P 500 outperformance)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests potential for a bounce, the negative relative divergence and relatively low PPO indicate caution.  The high expected return is encouraging for long-term investors.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-13 | 1.24    | 1.25         | -0.01      |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.85    | 1.8          | 0.05       |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.25    | 1.23         | 0.02       |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.27    | 1.25         | 0.02       |
| 2024-02-26 | 1.23    | 1.27         | -0.04      |

Earnings have been relatively close to expectations, with some slight misses and some beats.  Further analysis with a longer time frame would improve accuracy.


**5) Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a complete financial analysis.  This is a significant limitation.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

AEP's performance has lagged slightly behind the S&P 500 over the measured period, but the long-term expected return shows potential for outperformance. The company demonstrates a mixed risk profile; the moderate beta suggests lower market correlation, but the high maximum drawdown indicates potential for significant volatility.  The lack of financial data beyond EPS figures and the mixed signals from the technical indicators make it difficult to offer a definitive buy/sell recommendation.  A more comprehensive analysis including revenue, gross profit, and debt levels is necessary for a complete evaluation.  Long-term investors comfortable with moderate risk might find AEP's potential for long-term outperformance appealing. However, the lack of key financial data needs to be addressed before a strong recommendation can be made.
