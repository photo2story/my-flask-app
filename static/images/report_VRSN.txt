## VeriSign Inc. (VRSN) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

VeriSign Inc. is a provider of domain name registration and internet infrastructure services.  Over the period analyzed, VRSN's cumulative return (54.99%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 118.39%.  The difference is -63.4%, placing it at the 9.7th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slightly positive outperformance relative to the market benchmark, although this is inconsistent with the cumulative return figures. The Beta values, however, show increasing market sensitivity over time, ranging from 11 to 25.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $203.95
* **Last Market Price:** $205.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $201.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $195.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $187.77

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  The difference between the last market price and closing price is minimal, indicating no significant immediate price change.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 70.65 – This indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO:** 0.26 – A positive PPO suggests upward momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** +2.2 – Shows a recent short-term upward trend.

The expected return of -24.8% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern. This implies that, despite some short-term positive momentum, the stock is projected to substantially underperform the market index over the long run.  The relatively high RSI combined with negative expected return might signal an impending correction.  Since Last-Market price ($205.10) is only slightly higher than the closing price, no significant immediate price jump or drop is observed.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is limited and spans only a few quarters in 2012-2013.  Based solely on this limited data:

* **EPS:**  EPS shows some minor fluctuations around $0.55-$0.58, with a slight decrease to $0.50 in late 2012.  There's no clear trend visible from this limited data.
* **Revenue:** Revenue is relatively stable around $0.24B during the period shown, showing minor increases. There is limited information to draw any conclusion on revenue growth trends.  No comparison to expectations can be made because those figures are not provided.

**More data is required for a meaningful earnings analysis.**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively flat around $0.38B-$0.39B in recent quarters. Profit margins are consistently high (87%-88%), demonstrating strong profitability.
* **Capital & Profitability:**  Negative equity values are concerning and indicate potential financial risks.  The return on equity (ROE) is consistently negative, ranging from -10.59% to -16.74%, reflecting a poor return on invested capital.

No recent news or analyst opinions are provided for analysis.  Information on recent market outlook and earnings news within the last two days is missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

VRSN shows high profitability margins but faces concerns regarding negative equity and ROE, indicating potential financial instability. The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. Short-term technical indicators suggest some upward momentum, but the long-term outlook is negative, with a projected significant underperformance against the S&P 500.  The limited earnings data prevents a comprehensive analysis of recent performance.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions hinders a complete assessment. More information is crucial for a robust investment decision.

**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data provided, VRSN presents a mixed picture. While it boasts impressive profit margins, the negative equity, negative ROE, and substantial underperformance compared to the market raise significant concerns.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons for the negative equity and ROE, alongside recent news and analyst opinions, before forming a conclusive investment recommendation. The lack of crucial information significantly limits the reliability of this analysis.
