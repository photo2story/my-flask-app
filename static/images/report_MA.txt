2025-11-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of Mastercard (MA) based on the data provided, followed by a comprehensive analysis.

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Company Overview:** Mastercard Inc. is a global payment solutions company that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, and governments worldwide.
*   **MA Cumulative Return:** 55.62%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 94.64%
*   **Divergence:** -39.0
*   **Relative Divergence:** 5.6

**Analysis:** Mastercard has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period covered by the cumulative return data. The divergence of -39.0 indicates a substantial gap in returns. A relative divergence of 5.6 suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range. This divergence could indicate a potential buying opportunity if Mastercard's fundamentals remain strong, and the market is undervaluing the stock, but should be taken with caution since it could simply underperform the market.

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows a wide variance. Early periods (2015-2019) exhibited strong growth, while recent periods (2019-2025) have been significantly weaker, even negative in some cases.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, around 70-80%, indicating substantial potential for losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, which measures performance relative to the benchmark, is largely negative in recent periods. This confirms the underperformance compared to the overall market.
*   **Beta:** Beta has generally increased over time, suggesting that the stock has become more volatile and more sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization generally increased over the observed periods.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 540.40
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 540.4, Previous Close: 527.88, Change: 2.37%
*   **5-day SMA:** 532.61
*   **20-day SMA:** 548.96
*   **60-day SMA:** 567.10

**Analysis:** The current price is below the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) but above the 5-day SMA. This suggests a short-term upward trend but a possible longer-term downward trend. The recent price increase is significant (2.37% change), potentially indicating a recent rebound.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 47.43
*   **PPO:** -0.29
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** 2.1 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -62.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A Medium Investment recommendation suggests moderate risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 47.43 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a possible downtrend, but the value is very small and can be considered to be fairly neutral.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100% of cash" signal suggests a potentially favorable buying opportunity from the algorithm's perspective.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** A positive change indicates a recent improvement in the stock's relative performance compared to its peers or benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** A negative Expected Return of -62.1% is very concerning and suggests the model predicts the stock will significantly underperform over the next two years.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive News:**
    *   Prudential Financial Inc. bought shares of Mastercard.
    *   Mastercard Delivered Strong Q3 Results with Solid Growth Across Key Metrics.
    *   Tigress Financial Raises PT on Mastercard (MA) Stock.
*   **Neutral/Mixed News:**

*   **Unclear Relevance:**
    *   Can Nuveen Multi Market Income Fund (MA) stock sustain institutional flows - Quarterly Growth Report & Fast Gain Swing Alerts.

**Analysis:** Recent news is mixed. Positive news includes institutional investment and strong quarterly results, which could signal confidence in the company's future prospects. However, the article about a fresh look at Mastercard's valuation following a price cooling could indicate concerns about the stock's current price level.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.64)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 656.51 / 768.00 / 520.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a significant upside potential based on the average target price of $656.51. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty among analysts.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Mastercard's stock performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 in recent years, as evidenced by the negative Alpha and significant divergence in cumulative returns. While early periods showed strong growth, recent periods have been weak, with high maximum drawdowns.

Technically, the stock is showing some signs of a short-term rebound, but the negative PPO and negative expected return raise concerns about its longer-term outlook. Recent news is mixed, with positive reports about Q3 results and institutional investment offset by valuation concerns.

Analyst opinions are generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus and a target price significantly above the current price. However, it's important to note the wide range in target prices, reflecting uncertainty about the stock's future performance.

**In conclusion:** The data presents a mixed picture. While analyst ratings and some recent news are positive, the stock's underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high volatility, and concerning negative expected return suggest caution. A potential investor should conduct further due diligence, considering the mixed signals from different indicators and news sources, to determine if Mastercard is a suitable investment. Also, the very negative "Expected Return (%)" should be carefully examined as it is strongly contradictory to the Buy recommendations.
