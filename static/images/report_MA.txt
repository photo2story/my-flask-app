*   Increased institutional ownership can also be a positive sign, indicating confidence in the company's future.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Mastercard (MA) has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly in recent years, with a substantial divergence in cumulative returns.  Its historical performance (Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD) indicates a decline in risk-adjusted returns and increasing correlation with the market. The extremely negative expected return is the biggest red flag, suggesting that if you invested in MA now and held for 2 years, it would continue to significantly underperform the S&P 500.

However, recent news regarding a large share buyback program, a dividend increase, and increased institutional ownership have provided a short-term boost to the stock.  Analysts generally have a positive outlook, with a "Buy" consensus and a significantly higher average target price.

**Conclusion:**

The current picture is mixed. While recent news provides some positive momentum, the long-term underperformance, negative expected return, and high historical drawdowns are concerning. **Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards, considering the negative expected return despite the recent positive analyst ratings and corporate actions.** The recent price increase related to news may present an opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their positions. Any new investment decision should depend on individual risk tolerance and investment horizon. Additional research into the factors causing the underperformance and the likelihood of a turnaround is warranted.
