**2. Recent Price Movement**

As of the last recorded data:

* **Closing Price:** $523.34
* **Last Market Price:** $521.73
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $512.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $521.18

The price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively stable price trend, although the 5-day moving average indicates a recent slight uptrend.  The difference between the closing price and last market price is negligible.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.63.  This suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity, but it's not a definitive signal.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.08. A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +2.5. This indicates a short-term upward trend.

* **Expected Return:** 40.6%. This is a high expected return, particularly compared to the historical average of the S&P 500.  However, this projection needs to be viewed with caution, as it's highly dependent on numerous unquantifiable factors.  The high expected return likely reflects the significant outperformance historically observed, but this does not guarantee future performance.
