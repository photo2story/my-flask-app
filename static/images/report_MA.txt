**1. Return Rate Comparison and Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** Mastercard Inc. is a global payment solutions company facilitating electronic transactions worldwide.
*   **Numbers:**
    *   MA Cumulative Return: 62.59%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 99.09%
    *   Divergence: -37.3%
*   **Analysis:** Mastercard has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  The divergence of -37.3% indicates a considerable gap in returns. The relative divergence of 9.3 suggests that the current underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500. This could imply a potential for future catch-up, *but* the negative expected return raises serious concerns.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

*   **Table Data (Selected Highlights):**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 50.0%  | 68.7%  | 21.0%  | 0.0  | 136.8  |
| 2019-2021  | 3.0%   | 80.5%  | -43.0% | 0.6  | 324.8  |
| 2020-2022  | -39.0% | 80.5%  | -39.0% | 0.9  | 314.4  |
| 2023-2025  | 20.0%  | 80.1%  | -43.0% | 0.7  | 511.9  |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR & MDD:** While early periods show strong growth (CAGR), more recent periods display weaker or even negative returns. The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) consistently remains high, suggesting significant risk and volatility.
    *   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are a major red flag in recent years. Negative Alpha indicates that Mastercard is *underperforming* relative to its benchmark *after* accounting for risk (Beta).  The large negative Alpha in recent periods (-43.0%, -39.0%) is concerning.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values generally range from 0.0 to 0.9, indicating that MA has become more sensitive to market movements in recent years.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally increased, which can be an indicator of growth; however, this growth has not necessarily translated into higher returns.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Numbers:**
    *   Current Price: 566.21
    *   5-day SMA: 567.75
    *   20-day SMA: 550.76
    *   60-day SMA: 557.26
*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA but significantly above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a short-term downward trend but an overall upward trend in the past 20 and 60 days. The price experienced a small upward fluctuation from the previous close.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommendation) - This is moderately positive.
*   **RSI:** 62.43 - Approaching overbought territory (above 70).  Suggests the price may be due for a pullback.
*   **PPO:** 0.55 -  The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being positive suggests that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, which indicates an upward trend, but only slightly.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 9.3 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase) -  Indicates a recent improvement in relative performance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** -40.6% - **Extremely negative.**  This is a strong warning sign.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **News Highlights:**
    *   **Massachusetts Battery Start-Up to List on Stock Exchange:**  Unclear direct impact on Mastercard.
    *   **Mastercard Stock Price and Chart:**  General market tracking information.
    *   **Mastercard Stock Acquired Rep. Gilbert Ray Cisneros, Jr.:**  Could be perceived as positive or neutral.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Mastercard presents a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Strong brand and market position.
    *   Analyst consensus is "Buy" with a significant upside target price.
    *   Recent positive divergence change.
    *   Medium investment recommendation based on the MRI.
*   **Negatives:**
    *   **Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.**
    *   **Negative Alpha in recent periods indicates underperformance relative to risk.**
    *   **Extremely negative Expected Return (-40.6%). This is a major concern.**
    *   High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) suggests high volatility.
    *   News items suggest potential headwinds like a "legal overhang."

**Overall Recommendation:**

**Based on the data provided, especially the negative Alpha and extremely negative expected return, investing in Mastercard at this time appears HIGHLY RISKY.** While analyst opinions are positive, the fundamental data suggests a disconnect between market sentiment and actual performance. Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind the negative expected return and the legal overhang. The analyst's reasoning for a "Buy" recommendation needs to be scrutinized in light of the poor performance metrics.

**Before investing, a potential investor should:**

*   **Thoroughly investigate the reasons for the negative expected return.**
*   **Understand the "legal overhang" mentioned in the news.**
*   **Analyze the specific arguments supporting the "Strong Buy" rating from Seeking Alpha.**
*   **Assess their risk tolerance given the high volatility (MDD).**
*   **Consider the potential for further underperformance compared to the broader market.**
