## Mastercard Inc. (MA) Investment Review

This report analyzes Mastercard Inc. (MA), a global payments technology company that operates a worldwide payments network.  We will assess its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) and consider various financial metrics.  Note that this analysis is based solely on the provided data and may not reflect a complete picture.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Mastercard's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 90.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 67.9% indicates that Mastercard's performance has outperformed the S&P 500 by a substantial margin over the observed period, compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows consistent high growth for MA, significantly exceeding the market (implied by the S&P 500 performance).  However, the 2020-2022 period shows a negative CAGR, highlighting the impact of market fluctuations.  The relatively low maximum drawdown (MDD) in most periods suggests resilience compared to market volatility. A high beta consistently indicates significant market sensitivity.  Alpha consistently above zero suggests outperformance relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 532.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 528.25
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 520.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 506.28

The stock price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.83 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.11 (Positive; suggesting upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-), indicating a recent short-term decline.  However, given the moving average data, this could simply reflect a temporary pause. The Last-market price of 531.03 does not trigger a specific mention of a sharp price movement (no significant "sharp rise or fall").
* **Expected Return:** 118.1% (Long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 over two or more years). This points to potential significant outperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Mastercard has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in the provided data.  EPS has shown a steady upward trend throughout the reported quarters.  While revenue also demonstrates growth, the profit margin exhibits some minor fluctuations; there's no clear discernible trend.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Shows consistent quarter-over-quarter growth.
* **Profit Margin:** Generally high and stable, though there's a slight dip in Q3 2024.
* **Equity:** Increasing, indicating strong financial health.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** High and generally increasing, reflecting efficient use of shareholder equity.  A notable dip in Q4 2023 followed by a recovery.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information about recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This data was not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Mastercard demonstrates strong financial performance with consistently high revenue growth, profitability, and ROE.  Its stock price shows an upward trend and positive technical indicators.  The significantly higher cumulative return compared to the S&P 500 and a projected long-term outperformance (118.1% expected return), as well as consistently beating EPS expectations, paint a positive picture for the company.  However, a comprehensive analysis necessitates incorporating missing information, like recent news and analyst opinions, and a deeper investigation of industry trends.  The high beta value highlights its sensitivity to broader market shifts.

**8.  Limitations:** This analysis is limited by the scope of the data provided. A more thorough analysis would require additional information, including detailed revenue breakdowns, competitive landscape analysis, and macroeconomic factors.
