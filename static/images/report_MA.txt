**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Mastercard Inc. is a global payments technology company connecting consumers, businesses, and banks worldwide.  Over the reviewed period, Mastercard significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 204.27% compared to VOO's 119.91%.  This represents a substantial 84.36% difference.  The relative divergence of 71.7% highlights that this outperformance is considerably higher than its historical average relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent positive alpha values (except for 2020-2022), indicating that Mastercard has generated returns above what would be expected based solely on its beta (market risk). Beta values generally fluctuate around 0.7-1.1, suggesting a somewhat above-average sensitivity to market movements, but also room for higher returns than the overall market.  The significant CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across most periods further supports the strong performance of MA. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) demonstrates consistent growth.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $553.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $527.83

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (83.53):**  Indicates the stock is significantly overbought, suggesting a potential correction might be imminent.
* **PPO (0.80):** Shows positive momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (11.0+):**  Suggests a short-term upward trend in relative strength against the market.
* **Expected Return (29.3%):**  This represents a significant projected outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with a consistent investment approach.  The daily price drop of ~$1.87 is not significant enough to drastically alter this long-term outlook, especially considering the ongoing positive momentum indicated by the PPO.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Mastercard consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  This positive trend indicates strong financial performance and market confidence.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | Difference |

**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability indicators show robust and consistent performance.  Revenue growth is steady, and profit margins remain remarkably high, indicating strong operational efficiency. Equity has also been steadily increasing. Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates but consistently demonstrates strong profitability.  The dip in ROE in 2023-12-31 and 2024-03-31 may be worth further investigation to determine the cause.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Mastercard (MA) exhibits strong financial performance, consistently exceeding expectations and significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While the RSI suggests an overbought condition, indicating potential short-term price correction, the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by consistent revenue growth, high profit margins, exceeding EPS expectations and a high projected return.  The relatively high beta suggests some sensitivity to market fluctuations. However, the consistently positive alpha demonstrates that Mastercard's performance has been exceptionally strong compared to the overall market.  A long-term investment strategy in MA seems promising, but investors should monitor the RSI closely for any signs of a significant market correction.  Further investigation into the slight dips in ROE during the later quarters of 2023 and early 2024 might provide additional insight.
