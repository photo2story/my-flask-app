Mastercard shows a strong track record of growth and profitability, consistently outperforming the S&P 500.

The high ROE and consistently positive alpha suggest a strong potential for future growth, however, investors should be aware of the historical periods of high MDD, reflecting the inherent volatility of the stock.  The projected long-term expected return is substantial, making it a potentially attractive investment for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance.  Further due diligence, considering current market conditions and future projections, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
