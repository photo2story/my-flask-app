**6) Overall Analysis:**

Mastercard (MA) exhibits a strong long-term growth trajectory, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction.  While the company demonstrates consistently strong earnings and high profit margins, the high Beta indicates higher volatility.  The oversold RSI and negative PPO suggest a potential short-term buying opportunity for long-term investors, especially considering the significant long-term expected return exceeding the market benchmark.  Further analysis should consider macroeconomic factors and industry trends to refine this assessment.  Careful risk management is crucial given the stock's historical volatility.
