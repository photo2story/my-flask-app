Here's a comprehensive analysis of Mastercard Inc. (MA) based on the provided data, formatted as a report.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Mastercard Inc. (MA) is a global technology company in the payments industry.  The cumulative return of MA (186.7%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 116.4%.  The difference is 70.3%, placing it in the 60.8th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over the period 2015-2025 further reinforces this strong performance at 187.0%.  The Alpha of 70% indicates substantial outperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500).  A beta of 0.2 suggests low correlation with the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement**

As of the last market close, MA's price was $522.90.  The recent price movement indicates a relatively stable trend:

* **5-day moving average:** $512.86
* **20-day moving average:** $521.18
* **60-day moving average:** $520.12

The price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a modestly bullish short-term trend.  The 5-day moving average, however, is notably lower, potentially indicating recent volatility or a slight pullback.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.63. This suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.  However, it's crucial to consider this indicator in conjunction with other factors.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.08. A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.5. This indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength.

* **Expected Return:** 40.6%.  This represents a significant potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming the past performance is indicative of future results. However, past performance is not indicative of future results.
