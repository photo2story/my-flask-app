Mastercard (MA) demonstrates a strong track record of performance, consistently outperforming the S&P 500.  The recent price drop, while noticeable, doesn't negate the long-term bullish outlook supported by strong financials, consistent earnings beats, and a positive long-term expected return.  While the high RSI suggests potential short-term volatility, the company's fundamental strength and growth prospects make it an attractive investment for long-term investors with a moderate risk tolerance.  However,  it's important to monitor the market conditions and the company's performance closely.  The high beta implies that MA's price will likely be more volatile than the broader market.
