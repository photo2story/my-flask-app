The difference is 69.8 percentage points, placing it at the 60.4th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.

* **Closing Price:** $530.31
* **Last Market Price:** $528.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $531.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $526.00
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $513.17

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.73 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
