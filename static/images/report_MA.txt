* **Relative Divergence:** 56.2% (This means MA's performance relative to VOO is currently at the 56.2nd percentile of its historical range.)

**1. Performance Comparison (MA vs. VOO):**

Mastercard (MA) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return more than double that of the benchmark.  The relative divergence indicates that this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical range, though not at an extreme high.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $491.29
* **Last Market Price:** $491.49 (Slight increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $521.50
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $532.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $544.79

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term. The recent slight price increase in the last market price might be interpreted as a minor recovery.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk) â€“ Suggests caution.
* **RSI:** 32.92 (Below 30, indicating oversold conditions; however, this should be interpreted cautiously along with the other indicators.)
* **PPO:** -0.89 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.4% (Recent short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** 36.7% (Over two years, significantly higher than the implied VOO return.)

The technical indicators paint a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and declining relative divergence point to bearish momentum. The high MRI suggests caution is warranted.  The expected return is positive, but considering the present technicals, this should be examined cautiously.  The small positive change in the last market price doesn't appear significant enough to alter this overall assessment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Mastercard demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, consistently exceeding earnings expectations.  However, current technical indicators suggest a cautious outlook in the short term. While the significant outperformance against the S&P 500 and high expected return are positive, the negative PPO, low RSI, and high MRI warrant careful consideration.  A more detailed analysis, including valuation metrics and a deeper dive into the financial statements, would be necessary for a comprehensive investment recommendation.  The recent slight increase in price needs monitoring to see if it signifies a trend reversal.
