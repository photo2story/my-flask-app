**Analysis:** The table reveals a concerning trend of negative Alpha values in recent years. Alpha represents the excess return of an investment relative to a benchmark (in this case, likely the market). Negative Alpha suggests that Mastercard has been underperforming its benchmark even when accounting for its market risk (Beta). Beta consistently remains above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market. The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the given period, suggesting significant short-term risk. In recent years, the returns are going down while the Beta is dropping.

**Analysis:** Despite the recent underperformance and negative expected return, analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on Mastercard. The average target price of $657.84 suggests potential upside from the current price. The absence of recent rating changes implies that analysts haven't significantly adjusted their views despite recent market dynamics.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Mastercard is currently underperforming the S&P 500, and its expected future return is significantly negative based on current data. While recent news indicates institutional interest and diversification efforts, valuation concerns are repeatedly highlighted. The technical indicators are neutral, and the 20-day divergence change indicates recent downward momentum. While analysts maintain a "Buy" rating with potential upside, the negative Alpha, negative expected returns, and valuation concerns should be carefully considered. **In conclusion, caution is advised despite the analyst ratings. Further investigation into the valuation concerns and the reasons for the negative expected return is warranted before making investment decisions.**
