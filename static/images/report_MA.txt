**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $504.67
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $512.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $524.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $519.93

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 37.67 (Below 50, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.53 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -6.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 47.0% (This is significantly higher than typical market returns and should be viewed with caution.  The underlying assumptions for this calculation are not provided.)

The current price is relatively low compared to recent averages. While the oversold RSI suggests a potential bounce, the negative PPO and recent downward trend warrant caution. The high expected return requires further investigation of the assumptions used in its calculation.  The combination of relatively low price compared to recent averages with oversold RSI could suggest a short term bounce, but that does not negate the overall downward trend.

The current undervaluation relative to recent averages is a factor to consider alongside the bearish momentum signals.
