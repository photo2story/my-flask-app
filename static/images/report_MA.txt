* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 22.0% (This represents an expected excess return over the S&P 500 over the long term.)

**Analysis:**  The RSI indicates the stock isn't overbought, while the PPO suggests a slight bearish momentum. However, the positive relative divergence and price increase indicate potential for further growth, especially in the long term. The recent price increase (+$0.47) is relatively modest and does not suggest a sudden surge or decline.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Mastercard (MA) has demonstrated a history of strong financial performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent earnings are positive, and financial metrics are robust.  While technical indicators suggest a slightly bearish momentum, the upward trend in price and positive relative divergence point to potential for continued growth, especially in the long term.  The high relative divergence compared to the S&P 500 needs to be considered in context with current valuation; while outperformance is likely to continue, the magnitude might reduce.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) appears suitable, given the company's strong fundamentals and expected return.  However, potential investors should also consider broader market conditions and individual risk tolerance.
