*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 99.09%

| 2023-2025  | 20.0%   | 80.1%  | -43.0%| 0.7  | 511.9  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows fluctuating performance.  More recent periods (2019-2025) show weaker growth.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha has been negative in recent periods, suggesting underperformance relative to its benchmark. In other words, the stock has not been generating excess returns based on its risk profile.
*   **Beta:** Beta is increasing over time, indicating that MA is becoming more correlated with the market (S&P 500) and its volatility.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization continues to increase, indicating that the company is growing in size, despite recent underperformance.

**2) Simple Numbers: Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 566.21
*   **Previous Close:** 565.47
*   **Change:** 0.13
*   **5-day SMA:** 567.75
*   **20-day SMA:** 550.76
*   **60-day SMA:** 557.26

**Analysis:**

The current price is slightly up from the previous close. The 5-day SMA is above both the 20-day and 60-day SMA, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, which could be interpreted as a potential sign of weakness or consolidation in the medium term.

**3) Simple Numbers: RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 62.43
*   **PPO:** 0.55
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe, MRI: 0.9)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 9.3 (Positive, Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -40.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Indicates a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** RSI is at 62.43, suggesting the stock is approaching overbought territory (above 70).
*   **PPO:** The Positive Price Oscillator (PPO) at 0.55 indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, suggesting some upward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal provides a contradictory recommendation, suggesting a strong buy signal. This highlights the importance of looking at multiple indicators and not relying solely on one.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence indicates a recent short-term increase compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return of -40.6% is a major red flag, indicating a significant potential for losses if investing long-term from the current price.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

Mastercard currently presents a mixed investment picture.  While analyst consensus is generally positive and the company demonstrates strong fundamentals (increasing market cap), the recent performance relative to the S&P 500 has been weak. Key concerns include:

*   **Underperformance:** Mastercard has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Expected Return:**  The projected long-term return is alarmingly negative.
*   **High Drawdown:** Historical data suggests a high risk of significant losses.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** While the MRI suggests medium risk and some news outlets suggest a buy, the negative expected return and high drawdown should raise serious concerns.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the current data, a cautious approach to investing in Mastercard is warranted.

*   **Do NOT buy based solely on analyst ratings or the "Hybrid Signal".**
*   **Thoroughly investigate the reasons behind the negative expected return.** This could be related to overvaluation, changes in the competitive landscape, or other factors.
*   **Carefully consider your risk tolerance** given the historically high maximum drawdown.
*   **Monitor upcoming earnings reports and analyst revisions** for a clearer picture of the company's future prospects.
*   **Consider the broader economic environment** and its potential impact on Mastercard's business (consumer spending, interest rates, etc.).

In short, while Mastercard is a well-established company, the current data raises serious red flags that require further investigation before making any investment decisions.
