**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

The cumulative return for Mastercard (MA) is 176.61%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.47%.  The difference is 64.1%, placing it in the 56.1st percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This suggests that MA has historically outperformed VOO more often than not, but the current outperformance is not at a extreme high compared to its past performance.

The provided CAGR data shows consistently high growth rates for MA across the observed periods, though the period from 2020-2022 shows a negative CAGR, highlighting the impact of market conditions.  The alpha consistently above 0 suggests outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The relatively high beta values (above 1) indicate higher volatility compared to the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $504.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $509.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $522.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $519.90

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 34.23 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO:** -0.56 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -3.6% –  This shows a recent decrease in relative strength.

The RSI being below 30 and the price being below its moving averages suggest a possible short-term buying opportunity, though the negative PPO and relative divergence suggest caution.  A price of $504.91 does not, in itself, indicate a significant event. The expected return of 47.1% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is significant, but future performance is not guaranteed.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Mastercard has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters.  The consistent beat shows strong performance even considering the global economic environment.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is showing consistent growth, and profit margins remain impressively high, indicating strong operational efficiency.


**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is growing, and ROE is generally strong, though it fluctuates, indicating consistent profitability and efficient capital utilization, with some quarter-to-quarter variations.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Mastercard (MA) demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, supported by its consistent earnings beats, high profit margins, and strong ROE. The current price is below its moving averages and shows some bearish momentum, but the oversold RSI and the substantial long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 present a potentially attractive entry point for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance.  However, the higher beta suggests that the stock could experience substantial price swings in line with overall market movements. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before making any decisions.  Further analysis, considering macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape, is recommended.
