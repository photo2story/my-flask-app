**7. Overall Conclusion:**

Mastercard (MA) has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests a short-term decline, the company's fundamentals remain robust, with consistent earnings beats and high profit margins.  The relatively low RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound, but the negative PPO and negative relative divergence indicate ongoing bearish momentum.  A long-term (2+ years) investment approach, as indicated by the 36.6% expected long-term return outperformance versus S&P 500, warrants consideration, but careful monitoring of market conditions and further analysis are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The medium risk level (MRI) suggests caution in current market conditions.
