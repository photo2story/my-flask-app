## Mastercard Inc. (MA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Mastercard Inc. (MA) is a global payments technology company connecting consumers, businesses, and financial institutions through its payment networks.

The cumulative return for MA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns is 192.25% - 52.12% = 140.13%.  This places the current relative divergence at the 81.5th percentile based on historical data. This indicates MA has outperformed VOO considerably, but this is a relative performance measure and doesn't guarantee future returns.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows consistently high alpha (significantly outperforming the market) and a beta around 1.0 (similar volatility to the market).  This suggests strong performance irrespective of market conditions, with increasing CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over the analyzed periods. However, MDD (Maximum Drawdown) varies, highlighting potential risk even with strong overall performance.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | 4.0% | 14.1% | 6.0% | 1.0 | 314.9 |

The recent closing price shows a slight decrease from the previous close (-0.14%).  This is not a significant change and doesn't indicate a major upward or downward trend.

| 2023-09-30 | $6.31       | 50.67   |

Mastercard demonstrates strong and consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  ROE (Return on Equity) is also generally high, indicating efficient use of shareholder capital.  A slight dip in ROE in Q1 and Q4 2024 might warrant further investigation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Mastercard exhibits strong financial performance, consistently exceeding earnings expectations and demonstrating high profitability.  Technical indicators suggest a healthy market position, and the historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, supported by consistently high alpha, indicates a strong investment prospect.  While short-term price fluctuations are possible, the long-term outlook appears positive based on these factors.  The projected 41.3% outperformance of the S&P 500 over a 2+ year horizon is noteworthy but should be viewed with caution, as it's a projection based on past performance, not a guarantee of future returns.  The relatively low MDD figures in recent years also suggest the company is better able to withstand market corrections than others in its space.  Further investigation into the slight dip in ROE in some quarters may be necessary.
