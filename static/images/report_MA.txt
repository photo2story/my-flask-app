**7. 종합 Summary**

Mastercard (MA) has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent performance indicators suggest a mixed picture: the stock's RSI is nearing overbought levels and there's been a slight short-term decline in relative performance, but revenue, earnings, and profit margins remain very strong. Recent news points to volatility and the potential impact of market events and regulatory changes. Given the strong underlying financials, high expected return, and low market risk, a cautious buy strategy is suggested, focusing on long-term investment while closely monitoring news and market conditions. The recent negative alpha performance suggests that, while still profitable, MA may not be performing as well as it once did relative to the risk.
