*   **20-day SMA:** 546.55

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Mastercard is a well-established company, but the data suggests it has been underperforming the S&P 500 and has negative excess return for the investors. The recent news articles also indicate that the business is under some kind of transition (becoming a Data Analytics Business), buyouts, partnerships etc. The technical indicators are mixed, with the MRI suggesting medium risk, a neutral RSI, and a slightly positive PPO. However, the significantly negative expected return and recent negative divergence change are concerning.

**Conclusion:**

While analyst consensus remains positive and the stock has positive news recently, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, high MDD, negative Alpha, negative expected return, and recent negative divergence change warrants caution. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in Mastercard. The mixed signals from the data and news suggest that further research and monitoring are necessary. It is important to understand why the company is underperforming and whether its new strategies will be successful in the long run.
