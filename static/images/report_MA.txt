Over the analyzed period, MA significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 207.64% compared to VOO's 120.25%.  The difference of 87.4% places MA's performance in the 74th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates strong historical outperformance, but doesn't guarantee future returns.  The provided Alpha values generally show positive outperformance relative to the market (Beta > 1 indicates higher volatility than the market). However, the negative CAGR in 2020-2022 highlights the impact of market downturns on even high-performing stocks.  Market capitalization consistently increased, demonstrating growth and expansion.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($564.70) is slightly below the 5-day moving average ($565.28), suggesting recent minor price decline.  However, it is significantly above both the 20-day ($545.84) and 60-day ($530.87) moving averages, indicating an upward trend. The recent price change (-$0.79) shows a small daily decline, not significant enough to indicate a sharp drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 73.22 suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory, implying potential near-term price correction.  The PPO of 0.28 indicates a positive momentum. The 20-day relative divergence change of +1.4 confirms a short-term upward trend.  The substantial expected return of 27.4% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 suggests continued outperformance potential, although this is subject to market conditions and is not guaranteed.
