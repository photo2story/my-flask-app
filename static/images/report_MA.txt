**6. Overall Summary:**

Mastercard (MA) shows a strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. Positive alpha values and generally consistent earnings growth suggest a healthy financial outlook.  However, periods of significant drawdowns must be considered. The lack of revenue and gross profit data prevents a complete financial analysis.  Technical indicators provide a mixed signal with bullish momentum in the PPO, but recent slight relative strength weakening. The high expected return is positive, but the medium risk level should be considered.  Further investigation into the lack of financial statement data is necessary for a more comprehensive evaluation.  This analysis should be complemented with further research before making any investment decisions.
