2025-12-29 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the Mastercard (MA) data you've provided.

**1. Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** MA (Mastercard Inc)
*   **Company Overview:** Mastercard Inc. is a global payment solutions company that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, and governments, enabling electronic payments worldwide.
*   **MA Cumulative Return:** 66.43%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 103.21%
*   **Divergence:** Current divergence of -36.6% compared to VOO, with a range of -47.6% to 62.9%.  Relative divergence is 10.0.

**Analysis:**

*   Mastercard has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined.
*   The current divergence is closer to the minimum divergence historically, but is at 10%, meaning that it is very close to its worst divergence relative to S&P500 in the examined period. This suggests Mastercard is currently at a point of relatively weaker performance compared to the broader market within its recent historical range.
*   It's important to note that relative divergence does *not* mean MA is 10% *better* than VOO. It simply shows where the current divergence lies within its historical fluctuation range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 24.0%   | 80.1% | -44.0% | 0.7   | 524.0  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Growth has been quite volatile, ranging from strong positive figures in earlier periods to negative ones more recently.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  MDD is consistently high, around 70-80%, indicating substantial downside risk at times.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha has deteriorated significantly, moving from positive values (outperforming relative to risk) to large negative values (underperforming relative to risk). The last few years show significant underperformance compared to what would be expected based on its risk (Beta).
*   **Beta:** Beta has increased from close to 0 to nearly 1, implying that MA's price movements are more closely correlated with the overall market. A Beta of 1 suggests that MA's price tends to move in the same direction and magnitude as the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap has consistently grown over time, reflecting overall growth despite performance fluctuations.

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative divergence change indicates recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The significant negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting that the model predicts Mastercard will underperform the S&P 500 significantly over the long term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:**
    *   "Mastercard Incorporated Stock (NYSE: MA) Preview: Holiday Spending Signals Strength..." This suggests potential revenue drivers.
    *   "Reversal Confirmed BDH Industries Limited Stock Rallies Above MA" and "Reversal Confirmed Stellant Securities (India) Limited Stock Rallies Above MA" - These may mean that the stock is recovering.
*   **Negative Headlines:**
    *   "Sapient Capital LLC Sells 2,399 Shares of Mastercard Incorporated $MA" and "Highland Capital Management LLC Sells 9,570 Shares of Mastercard Incorporated $MA" - Institutional selling pressure.
*   **Neutral Headline:**
    *   "EVTC vs. MA: Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now?" - This is a comparison piece and doesn't definitively point one way or the other.

**Analysis:**

*   The news is mixed, with some positive signals about holiday spending and positive sentiment (from "reversal confirmed"), but also negative signals from institutional selling.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Opinions:** 36 Analysts
*   **Target Price:** $657.92 (Average)

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts generally have a positive outlook on the stock, with a consensus of "Buy" and an average target price significantly above the current price.
*   The lack of recent rating changes suggests that analysts' views haven't shifted dramatically recently.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Performance:** Mastercard has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, and the trend suggests it will continue.
*   **Risk:** MDD is high, indicating risk.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The RSI is overbought, suggesting a potential pullback. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating that it is recovering.
*   **News:** Mixed, with positive signals offset by institutional selling.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts are generally positive, but this contrasts with the negative signals from the performance data.
*   **Expected Return:** The expected return compared to S&P 500 of -38.2% is a substantial negative indicator.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Despite the positive analyst consensus, the data presents a concerning picture. The underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high MDD, negative Alpha, and, most importantly, the *very* negative expected return compared to S&P 500 raise serious concerns.  While analysts are bullish, the quantitative data suggests caution.
