| 2023-2025  | 20.0%   | 80.1%   | -43.0%  | 0.7   | 511.9  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR has fluctuated, with stronger growth in earlier periods (2015-2019).  More recent periods (2020-2023) show negative growth. The most recent period 2023-2025 shows a rebound.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** MDD has remained relatively high (around 80%) in recent years, suggesting substantial potential declines from peak values.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha has been *negative* for the more recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark (risk-adjusted).
*   **Beta:** Beta has generally increased over time, peaking at 0.9 indicating the stock became more correlated and therefore moved more with the market and is quite sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally grown, although recent performance has not been reflected in market cap growth.

**Analysis:** The data shows a shift in Mastercard's performance. Initially, it outperformed its benchmark (high Alpha).  More recently, it has underperformed (negative Alpha), with increased correlation to the market (higher Beta) and significant potential downside risk (high MDD).

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 566.21
*   **Previous Close:** 565.47
*   **Change:** 0.13
*   **5-day SMA:** 567.75
*   **20-day SMA:** 550.76
*   **60-day SMA:** 557.26

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the previous close, indicating a small upward movement. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which *could* signal a short-term upward trend. However, the current price is below the 5-day SMA, which could indicate the short-term trend has peaked and may reverse.

**3. Market Risk Indicators, Hybrid Signal, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 62.43 (Approaching overbought territory, potentially signaling a possible pullback)
*   **PPO:** 0.55
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash" (Suggests a strong buy signal based on the hybrid model, Very Safe, and assumes monthly investment of $1,000)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 9.3 (+) (Indicates a recent short-term increase in divergence.)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -40.6% (This is a very negative expected return over the next two years compared to the S&P 500.)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium-risk investment, while the RSI implies the stock may be approaching overbought conditions. The "Hybrid Signal" strongly contradicts the expected return, as the model recommends a "very safe" purchase even if it is supposed to underperform compared to the S&P 500. The expected return is significantly negative, suggesting potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. The relative divergence change indicates short-term positive momentum, which contrasts the negative expected return. The change of 0.13 from the previous close is fairly low indicating stable price movement, so does not reflect a sharp rebound or decline.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

The news articles cover a range of topics:

*   A battery start-up listing on the stock exchange (potentially unrelated to Mastercard).
*   Mastercard stock price analysis and charts on TradingView.
*   Rep. Gilbert Ray Cisneros, Jr. acquired Mastercard stock (positive sentiment, though the impact of one individual's purchase is limited).
*   An article questioning if Mastercard is still attractive after a strong run.
*   CPI surprise, new partnerships, legal overhang, and Wall Street forecasts.
*   An article on Seeking Alpha arguing why Mastercard is a strong buy.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. Some articles suggest positive sentiment and potential for growth, while others question its current valuation and attractiveness. The news regarding CPI surprise, legal overhang, and Wall Street forecasts suggests more short term changes may be expected.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.59)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 657.37 / 768.00 / 520.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes reported

**Analysis:** Analysts are generally bullish on Mastercard, with a consensus "Buy" rating and a significant upside potential based on the average target price. The target price range is wide, indicating varying degrees of optimism among analysts.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Mastercard's recent performance has been weaker than the S&P 500. While analysts remain positive with a "Buy" consensus and potential upside, the fundamentals presented a mixed outlook:

*   **Short-Term vs. Long-Term:** The short-term technical indicators suggest a possible slight upward trend, however, the expected long-term return is negative. The recent positive change in relative divergence also points to a short-term upward momentum.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The "Hybrid Signal" recommends a strong buy, while the expected return is significantly negative. This discrepancy needs further investigation. The mixed news sentiment, with positive articles counterbalanced by concerns about valuation, adds to the uncertainty.
*   **Key Concerns:** The negative Alpha, high MDD, and negative expected return should be carefully considered. While analyst ratings and target prices are positive, they might not fully reflect the risks indicated by the historical performance and market risk indicators.

**Recommendation:** While analyst opinions are strong, a cautious approach is warranted due to the contradictory signals. Further investigation is needed to understand the discrepancies between the hybrid signal and expected return. Consider the negative alpha, MDD, and expected return.
