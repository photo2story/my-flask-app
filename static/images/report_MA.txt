* **20-Day Moving Average:** 515.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 501.59

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term downward pressure. However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The last market price (514.72) being higher than the closing price implies some potential negative sentiment at the close of the trading day.
