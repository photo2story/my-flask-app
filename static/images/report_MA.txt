## Mastercard Inc. (MA) Investment Review

This report analyzes Mastercard Inc. (MA), a global payments technology company connecting billions of consumers and businesses worldwide, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Mastercard's cumulative return (193.87%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (122.07%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 71.8%, placing it at the 61.9th percentile of the historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong historical relative performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $534.45 (Last Market: $536.21)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $527.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $524.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $511.28

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The slight difference between the last market price and closing price indicates minimal recent volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (69.22):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (-0.04):** Slightly negative, indicating bearish momentum. However, this should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +5.7%, indicating recent upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (106.5%):** A significant long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500 is anticipated.  This should be viewed with caution as it's a prediction, not a guarantee. The difference between the closing price and last market price is minimal and doesn't suggest any significant immediate price movement (neither a sharp rise nor fall).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Mastercard consistently exceeded EPS expectations in the last five quarters.  While revenue numbers aren't explicitly provided in this section, the consistent EPS beat suggests healthy revenue growth.  EPS shows a steady upward trend.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is increasing, and ROE fluctuates but generally trends upwards, highlighting a strong return on investment for shareholders.  The significant jump in ROE in Q3 2023 needs to be analyzed further with additional data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Mastercard exhibits strong financial performance, consistently exceeding earnings expectations and demonstrating robust revenue and profit growth.  Its historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is significant. While the RSI suggests potential short-term price correction, the long-term outlook appears positive, supported by the predicted high excess return.  However, this positive outlook hinges on the absence of any significant negative news or unexpected market shifts, and the provided projected return needs to be interpreted with caution.  Further analysis, including missing news and market data, would enhance the comprehensiveness of this investment review.
