    * **Closing Price:** $45.00
    * **5-day Moving Average:** $44.15
    * **20-day Moving Average:** $42.13
    * **60-day Moving Average:** $41.21

    The recent price trend indicates a gradual uptick, as the closing price is above all three moving averages.

3. **Technical Indicators:**
    * **RSI:** 73.0 - This suggests that VZ is currently in overbought territory, indicating potential for a short-term pullback.
    * **PPO:** 0.76 - A positive PPO value implies that the price is above its moving average, suggesting potential for further upward movement.

        | **Estimated Earnings (Bloomberg Consensus):**  1.10 | $32.78 B | 

    The latest earnings report shows a slight miss on revenue and a meet on EPS compared to analyst estimates. However, it is important to note that these results are just one data point and should be analyzed in context with broader industry trends and macroeconomic factors.

VZ currently faces challenges in its stock performance compared to the broader market, as evidenced by its significant underperformance against the S&P 500. However, there are encouraging signs of potential positive movement based on its recent price action, positive technical indicators, and relatively strong earnings performance. While the current RSI suggests potential for a short-term pullback, the overall trend remains positive. Investors should carefully monitor VZ's performance in the coming weeks and months to better assess its future trajectory.
