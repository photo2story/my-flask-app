**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a mixed picture regarding VZ's performance relative to the market (Beta):

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 29.5% | 9.3% | -8.9% | 0.7 | 222.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 40.7% | 13.1% | 8.4% | 0.5 | 236.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 28.8% | 13.1% | -22.9% | 0.4 | 258.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 25.1% | 16.2% | -22.3% | 0.5 | 247.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 5.5% | 16.2% | -94.6% | 0.5 | 218.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -25.7% | 30.1% | -49.3% | 0.5 | 165.9 |
| 2021-2023  | -24.2% | 30.1% | -59.1% | 0.4 | 158.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -2.7% | 30.1% | -31.1% | 0.3 | 175.3 |


While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of strong growth, the negative Alpha values in several years indicate underperformance against the benchmark.  The Beta, generally between 0.4 and 0.7, suggests moderate sensitivity to overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $42.25
* **5-day Moving Average:** $41.26
* **20-day Moving Average:** $41.33
* **60-day Moving Average:** $42.44

The price is slightly above the short-term moving averages but below the 60-day average, suggesting some recent price consolidation or minor weakness.  The Last-market price of $41.9 is not significantly different from the closing price.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.49 - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, sitting in neutral territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.31 - A positive value indicates bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 2.58 (+) - Shows a positive short-term relative strength gain.  


The provided expected return of 0.0% is likely a projection for the short term. A long-term (2+ years) investment with regular contributions might yield a positive return, but the significantly lower historical returns compared to the S&P 500 make exceeding the S&P 500's performance unlikely without significant market shifts favoring VZ.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The EPS (Earnings Per Share) and revenue data show some volatility:


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 0.78 | $33.33 B     |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.09 | $32.80 B     |
| 2024-04-25 | 1.09 | $32.98 B     |
| 2023-10-26 | 1.13 | $33.34 B     |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.13 | $33.34 B     |


There's a noticeable drop in EPS in the October 2024 report.  A comparison with analyst estimates for this period is crucial to determine whether this is a significant underperformance.  The revenue remains relatively stable.  Duplicate entries for October 25, 2024, need clarification.



**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

**1) Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been relatively stable, while profit margins fluctuate but generally remain high (above 55%).  The slight dip in Q4 2023 suggests potential headwinds.

**2) Capital and Profitability:**  ROE (Return on Equity) shows volatility, swinging between positive and negative values.  This highlights the risk associated with investing in VZ.  The substantial equity suggests a strong financial position but doesn't necessarily translate into consistent profitability.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires accessing real-time news sources like Shacknews, Finbold, etc., and analyst reports.  I cannot access real-time information.)*  To complete this section, please provide recent news articles or analyst reports on VZ. I need this data to summarize recent market outlook, analyst opinions and performance highlights.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

Verizon has shown a consistent underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While it maintains a strong financial position, the recent volatility in EPS, fluctuating ROE, and moderate growth make it a riskier investment compared to the broader market. The neutral RSI and positive but weak PPO suggest a stock currently in a state of consolidation with the potential for further price movement in either direction.  A thorough evaluation of the most recent earnings reports and analyst forecasts, along with a detailed look at current market sentiment, is critical before making any investment decisions. The expected long-term return, even with consistent investment, is uncertain and likely below the market average based on historical data.
