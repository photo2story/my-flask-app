The cumulative return of VZ is -21.16% compared to 89.66% for the S&P 500, resulting in a substantial divergence of -110.82%. This places VZ at the 2.33 percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500.

2. **Price Momentum:** VZ's price is currently trading slightly above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and these moving averages indicates a lack of strong momentum. 
    * **Closing Price:** 41.78
    * **5-Day Moving Average:** 41.49
    * **20-Day Moving Average:** 40.83
    * **60-Day Moving Average:** 40.74

3. **Technical Indicators:** The RSI of 66.07 suggests that VZ is currently in overbought territory, potentially signaling a short-term correction. The PPO of 0.25 indicates a positive momentum but is relatively low, suggesting a lack of strong upward pressure. The negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-7.41) highlights a recent decrease in the stock's relative performance against the market, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. Despite this, the Expected_Return of 4.35% reflects a positive outlook for long-term investors.

4. **Recent Earnings & Outlook:**  Verizon has consistently maintained its revenue and earnings growth over the last four quarters. The latest earnings report for the quarter ending July 25, 2024, shows EPS of $1.09 and revenue of $32.80 billion. While the EPS met analyst expectations, revenue slightly missed estimates. Going forward, Verizon is expected to continue its growth trajectory, driven by investments in 5G technology and fiber optic infrastructure, as well as its strong subscriber base.

**Overall Analysis:**

Verizon's performance has been lackluster compared to the broader market, evidenced by its significant underperformance against the S&P 500. While the current price momentum is slightly positive, technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction. However, Verizon's consistent earnings and revenue growth, along with its long-term growth prospects driven by investments in 5G and fiber optics, make it a potentially attractive investment for long-term investors with a patient outlook.
