The latest earnings report for Q2 2024 shows that VZ met analysts' expectations for both EPS and revenue. While the company continues to maintain its leading position in the telecommunications market, growth is expected to slow in the coming quarters due to macroeconomic headwinds.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

VZ is currently exhibiting a mixed performance. While its recent earnings beat expectations, the stock's significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 raises concerns. Technical indicators suggest potential upward momentum, but the overbought RSI and short-term downtrend suggest potential near-term correction. The 17.3% Expected Return provides a positive outlook for long-term investors, but the current market conditions and VZ's growth prospects should be closely monitored.
