## JST-USD: Unknown Company Stock Review

**Summary:** This report analyzes the performance of JST-USD, an unknown company, comparing its returns to the S&P 500 (VOO) and examining key technical indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

JST-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return for JST-USD is 73.77%, while the S&P 500's is 23.86%.  This results in a large divergence of 49.9, placing it in the 9.1 percentile of its historical range of divergence (ranging from -37.5 to 927.0).  While this high cumulative return is impressive, the following CAGR analysis reveals significant volatility and potential risks.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | 47.0% | 80.1% | 43.0% | 0.2 |  |
| 2021-2023  | -56.0% | 80.1% | -69.0% | 0.3 |  |
| 2022-2024  | -49.0% | 71.3% | -67.0% | 0.4 |  |
| 2023-2025  | -15.0% | 69.8% | -31.0% | 0.4 |  |

**Analysis of CAGR and other metrics:** The table shows highly volatile performance.  While some periods show substantial positive CAGR (e.g., 47% from 2020-2022), others exhibit significant negative returns (e.g., -56% from 2021-2023).  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) consistently above 70% across all periods highlights significant downside risk.  The alpha values suggest the stock's performance isn't consistently exceeding the market (considering alpha near 0), and the beta increases over time (indicating increasing sensitivity to market movements).  The lack of capitalization data hinders a full assessment.  The high cumulative return should be viewed cautiously in light of this volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.040076
* **Last Market Change:** -2.14% (a small drop)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $0.035
* **20-day Moving Average:** $0.0318
* **60-day Moving Average:** $0.0313

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the recent price drop of -2.14% should be noted.  Further investigation into the cause of this recent drop is recommended.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3804 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 94.17 (Extremely overbought, indicating potential for a significant price correction)
* **PPO:** 2.89 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 751.1% (This extremely high projected return needs to be scrutinized carefully given the high volatility and overbought RSI.)

The high RSI value (94.17) strongly suggests the stock is significantly overbought and prone to a correction. The positive PPO and upward trend in relative divergence indicate some short-term bullish momentum, but this is likely unsustainable given the RSI level.  The extremely high expected return of 751.1% must be viewed with extreme caution, considering its volatility and the lack of supporting fundamental analysis.  The high expected return could be an artifact of the extreme volatility and high past returns, not a reliable prediction of future gains.


**Conclusion:**

While JST-USD shows impressive cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500, its high volatility, substantial maximum drawdowns, and extremely overbought RSI signal significant risk. The projected long-term return is potentially misleading and should not be taken at face value. A deeper dive into the fundamentals of this unknown company is crucial before any investment decision.  The high risk profile and significant potential for price correction should be carefully considered.  Additional information is needed on the company's business model and financials before a sound investment recommendation can be offered.
