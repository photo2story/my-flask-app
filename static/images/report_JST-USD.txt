**Performance Analysis:**

JST-USD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, exhibiting a cumulative return of 73.24% compared to VOO's 23.86%.  The difference of 49.38% is substantial. However, the high relative divergence (9.0%) and the overbought RSI (94.10) suggest a potential for a correction. The recent price increase of 2.43% reflects a short-term upward trend, supported by the positive PPO and the increasing 20-day relative divergence. The medium risk MRI indicates a relatively stable market environment.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta values show inconsistent performance across different periods.  While the Alpha is generally low, indicating the fund does not consistently outperform the market after accounting for risk, there is a positive Alpha of 0.1 in the 2023-2025 period. The Beta values increase over time (0.2 to 0.4), suggesting increasing sensitivity to market movements. The high maximum drawdown (MDD) consistently above 70% highlights significant periods of substantial losses.  The inconsistent CAGR demonstrates substantial volatility and lack of consistent positive performance. The market capitalization (Cap) appears to remain relatively small throughout.

**Moving Averages:**

The price ($0.03995) is above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, 60-day), suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, the relatively small difference between the price and the moving averages indicates the uptrend may not be strong.

**Technical Indicators:**

The extremely high RSI (94.10) indicates that the asset is significantly overbought, suggesting a potential for a price reversal or correction.  The positive PPO (2.86) supports the short-term upward momentum, but should be interpreted cautiously given the high RSI.  The positive Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (3.1) supports the short-term upward trend.


**Expected Return and Risks:**

The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of 760.6% relative to the S&P 500 is exceptionally high and needs to be viewed with extreme skepticism.  This exceptionally high figure likely reflects the high volatility and the significant risk associated with this investment.  The high MDD values from the past strongly reinforce this point.  Any investment decision should consider the high risk involved, alongside the highly volatile nature of the stock as reflected in the historical data.  More detailed fundamental analysis of the underlying company is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The past performance is not indicative of future results.
