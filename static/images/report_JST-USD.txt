## JST-USD: Unknown Company Stock Review

This report analyzes the performance of JST-USD, an Unknown Company, comparing its returns to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **JST-USD Cumulative Return:** 37.40%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 22.90%
* **Return Difference:** 14.50% (JST-USD outperformed VOO by 14.5 percentage points)

**Company Overview:**  (Further details on Unknown Company are needed for a complete overview).


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures reveal significant volatility and inconsistent performance over the observed periods.  Alpha consistently hovers around zero, suggesting the stock's returns are primarily driven by market movements (Beta), rather than unique company-specific factors. Beta fluctuates between 0.3 and 0.5, indicating a moderate sensitivity to market changes.  The negative CAGRs from 2021 onwards suggest considerable underperformance in recent years.  A market cap (Cap(B)) of under 1 Billion should be considered.  Noteworthy is that the negative CAGRs contrast starkly with the positive cumulative return shown previously, suggesting that the cumulative return could be primarily driven by a very early period of performance.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | 47.0% | 80.1% | 43.0% | 0.0 |  <1  |
| 2021-2023  | -56.0% | 80.1% | -69.0% | 0.0 |  <1  |
| 2022-2024  | -49.0% | 71.3% | -67.0% | 0.0 |  <1  |
| 2023-2025  | -51.0% | 69.8% | 0.1 | 0.4 |  <1  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.0317
* **Last Market Price:** $0.0435 (significant increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.0314
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.0307
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.0311

The last market price shows a substantial 32.99% increase compared to the previous close. This indicates a recent and potentially significant price surge (**급반등**). The moving averages suggest a generally flat trend with a recent upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 74.21 (Overbought territory; suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.54 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1346.3% (This extremely high figure needs further justification and context. It seems unusually high and may reflect assumptions that require further scrutiny. The timeframe is important here: is it based on short-term projections or a more long-term view?  It is also crucial to understand what it is relative to, i.e., the expected return from alternative investments)


**Conclusion:**

JST-USD has shown significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the past, but the recent negative CAGRs and the high RSI indicate potential risk. The recent sharp price increase warrants caution.  The extremely high projected return needs further investigation and clarification concerning its methodology and assumptions, especially considering the contradictory evidence from CAGR. A deeper dive into the fundamentals of Unknown Company and a more detailed analysis of the expected return calculation is required for a comprehensive assessment.  The high volatility and fluctuating Beta suggest it's not suitable for risk-averse investors. Further information on the company and the methodology for calculating the expected return are crucial for informed decision-making.
