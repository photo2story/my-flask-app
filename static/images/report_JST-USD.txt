| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                  |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| 2020-2022  | 47.0% | 80.1% | 43.0% | 0.0   |       | High CAGR, but significant MDD.  High Alpha |
| 2021-2023  | -56.0%| 80.1% | -69.0%| 0.0   |       | Negative CAGR, high MDD, very low alpha |
| 2022-2024  | -49.0%| 71.3% | -67.0%| 0.0   |       | Negative CAGR, high MDD, low alpha       |
| 2023-2025  | -52.0%| 69.8% | -67.0%| 0.1   |       | Negative CAGR, high MDD, low alpha       |

**Analysis:**  The provided data shows highly volatile performance for JST-USD. While the 2020-2022 period exhibited a strong positive CAGR, subsequent years show significant negative returns, suggesting high risk.  The low to near-zero beta indicates limited correlation with the overall market, and the alpha values suggests periods of significant outperformance but currently below-market returns.  The consistency of high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights substantial risk.  More data is needed to assess the long-term trend and risk profile accurately.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 0.0316
* **Last Market Price:** 0.0399 (a recent increase of 2.18% from the previous close of 0.0390)
* **5-day Moving Average:** 0.0316
* **20-day Moving Average:** 0.0307
* **60-day Moving Average:** 0.0310

The price is slightly above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potentially mildly positive short-term trend. The recent price increase indicated by `Last-market` needs to be considered in context with the longer-term trend and volatility observed in the CAGR data.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.382 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 69.27 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.51 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1342.2% (This extremely high number needs further explanation and context.  Is this an annualized return?  What is the time horizon?  It appears unrealistic based on the previous data.)

The high expected return of 1342.2% seems unusually high and requires clarification on its calculation methodology and assumptions. The RSI is approaching overbought levels, suggesting a potential near-term correction could occur. The positive PPO indicates potential upward momentum, but it should be interpreted cautiously given the historical volatility. The 0.0 relative divergence suggests short-term weakness.

**Overall:**

JST-USD demonstrates high volatility and significant risk.  While the recent performance has shown positive gains against the S&P 500, past performance is not indicative of future results.  The extremely high projected long-term return needs further justification.  A thorough investigation into the company's fundamentals and a more detailed analysis are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high MDD and negative CAGRs in recent years highlight the considerable risk involved.  Further clarification on the calculations of the expected return is strongly recommended.
