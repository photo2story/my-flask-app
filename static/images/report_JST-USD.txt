## JST-USD: Unknown Company Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

JST-USD, an Unknown Company, shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While the exact nature of the company is unknown, the data suggests high volatility and potentially high risk.  Further investigation into the company's fundamentals is crucial.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **JST-USD Cumulative Return:** 37.11%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 23.79%
* **Return Difference:** 13.32% (JST-USD outperformed VOO by 13.32%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 5.3% (This indicates JST-USD's performance is in the higher range of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, but not exceptionally high.)


**Analysis of Provided Alpha/Beta Data:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data reveals significant volatility and inconsistency in JST-USD's performance.  The negative CAGRs over several periods, coupled with high maximum drawdowns (MDD), highlight considerable risk.  The near-zero alpha suggests the stock hasn't significantly outperformed the market (after adjusting for beta), especially in recent periods. The increasing beta values indicate increasing market sensitivity over time, further emphasizing the risk profile.  The small market capitalization (Cap(B)) suggests this is a smaller company, inherently more volatile.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.0316
* **Last Market Price:** $0.0404 (a recent increase of 3.48% from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.0316
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.0307
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.0310

The recent price of $0.0404 is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, although the 20-day MA suggests some short term downward pressure.  The 3.48% increase from the previous close is noteworthy and should be investigated further to understand the underlying cause.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk) -  This suggests a moderate level of risk associated with the stock.
* **RSI:** 69.27 (Approaching overbought territory) - RSI above 70 generally indicates that the asset is overbought and may be due for a correction.
* **PPO:** 0.51 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum) - The positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term downward trend) -  This indicates a slight weakening of the upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 1369.6% (This extremely high figure needs serious scrutiny.  Such a high expected return is highly unlikely and warrants investigation into the methodology used for its calculation.)

**Conclusion:**

JST-USD exhibits high volatility and inconsistent performance.  While it has shown periods of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, the substantial risk associated with negative CAGRs and high MDDs should be carefully considered.  The high expected return needs clarification and likely relies on assumptions that may not be realistic.  The recent price increase requires further analysis to determine the underlying causes.  Thorough fundamental analysis of the company is essential before making any investment decisions.  Given the data presented, investing in JST-USD involves a very high level of risk.  It's crucial to further research the company's financials and business model before considering any investment.
