**Analysis:** The table provides a rolling 3-year performance snapshot.  Key takeaways:

*   **Alpha:**  ANET consistently generates positive alpha (except 2017-2019 and 2018-2020), meaning it's outperforming its benchmark risk-adjusted return, and this is especially strong in recent periods (2020-2025). The strong alpha suggests skilled management or a favorable industry environment.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally above 1, suggesting ANET's price is more volatile than the market. Recent years (2023-2025) show a higher beta (1.8), indicating even more sensitivity to market movements.
*   **CAGR:** The CAGR fluctuates but is very high in recent periods, reflecting strong growth.  Note the very negative CAGR in 2018-2020.
*   **MDD:** The maximum drawdown (MDD) indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline. MDD is generally acceptable, but 50.6% in 2023-2025 indicate relatively high risk.
*   **Cap(B):** The increasing capitalization highlights the company's growth in market value.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 123.72
*   **Last Market Data:** price: 122.89, previousClose: 123.72, change: -0.67
*   **5-day SMA:** 131.434
*   **20-day SMA:** 130.054
*   **60-day SMA:** 135.271

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This *might* indicate a short-term downward trend. The fact that the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are below the 60-day SMA, reinforces this potential downtrend.  The negative change in the last market data also supports this. The small difference between the last day price (122.89) and the closing price (123.72) is a general fluctuation issue.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 51.87
*   **PPO:** -0.0662
