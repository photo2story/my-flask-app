- **Beta**: Very high – consistently > 1, indicating the stock is more volatile than the market.
- **MDD**: Remained in the 28–51 % band in recent years, suggesting moderate downside risk when compared to the earlier 38.6 % plateau.

# 3️⃣ Price & Moving Averages  

- **Close:** $122.89  
- **5‑day SMA:** $129.29  
- **20‑day SMA:** $129.58  
- **60‑day SMA:** $135.01  

**Interpretation**

- The stock is **below all short‑term averages** – a bearish short‑term picture.  
- A break below the 5‑day SMA could signal a further pullback.  
- However, the 60‑day SMA still sits roughly 12 % above the current price, implying that a longer‑term upside remains possible if the trend reverses.

# 4️⃣ Technical & Risk Indicators  

| Indicator | Value | Comment |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **RSI** | 47.5 | Near‑neutral – no over‑bought/over‑sold condition. |
| **PPO** | ‑0.42 | Slightly negative momentum; could hint at a short‑term pullback. |
| **MRI** | 0.70 | **Medium‑Risk** – recommend a cautious stance. |
| **Hybrid Signal** | Buy 90 % of cash | Suggests a moderate‑confidence entry using cash. |
| **Δ Relative Divergence (20 d)** | ‑9.3 | Slight worsening trend. |
| **7‑day Rank** | ‑3 | Dropping in short‑term relative strength. |
| **7‑day Dynamic Expected Return** | +52 % | Improving long‑term outlook. |
| **Expected Return (long‑term)** | **191.5 %** | > 190 % over > 2 yr; well above VOO. |

**Bottom line:** While the short‑term momentum shows some weakness (PPO, Δ divergence), the long‑term expectation is strong (high Expected Return). MRI signals medium risk, so a balanced allocation is advised.

# 9️⃣ Comprehensive Summary  

- **Performance**: ANET has dramatically out‑performed the S&P 500 over the observed period (cumulative return ≈ 169 % higher).  
- **Risk‑Reward**: Very high beta and recent negative alpha in 2018‑2020 suggest volatility, but recent alpha (> 100 %) and a high expected return (191.5 %) reinforce the upside case.  
- **Price Action**: Current price trails all short‑term SMAs, signaling a short‑term bearish bias. Long‑term upside still viable if the trend turns.  
- **Technical Outlook**: RSI near neutral, PPO slightly negative, MRI indicates medium risk. The hybrid signal recommends buying 90 % of cash, supporting a cautious entry.  
- **News & Analyst Sentiment**: Positive analyst consensus (Strong Buy, target ~$164), but recent 6 % dip in early Jan‑2026 and mixed headlines caution against over‑exposure.  
- **Financial Health**: Revenue and profit margins are robust; equity base is growing and ROE stays strong.  
- **Earnings**: Recent EPS volatility suggests the 2024‑11 spike may be non‑recurring; focus on revenue growth for future profitability.

**Investment Stance**  
- **Medium‑risk** position with a **cautious** allocation (e.g., 90 % cash, 10 % ANET) while awaiting a clear short‑term trend reversal.  
- Monitor for **price breaks** below the 5‑day SMA and for any **earnings surprises** that could shift the long‑term outlook.  
- Given the high expected return versus VOO, the stock remains an attractive play for investors willing to tolerate higher volatility.
