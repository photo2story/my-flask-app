*   **20-day Moving Average:** 146.28
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 138.92

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5 (Low Investment - Suggests moderate risk)
*   **RSI:** 49.78 (Neutral - Neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.78 (Slightly Bearish - Indicates the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, but the difference is not substantial)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** -5.8 (Negative - Indicates short-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500)
*   **Expected Return:** 88.8% (Indicates significant potential outperformance vs. S&P 500 with long-term investment)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a low-risk investment, while the RSI is neutral. However, the PPO and, most importantly, the Hybrid Signal "Cash_80%_Sell" suggests caution. The negative change in the relative spread further reinforces the short-term bearish outlook. Despite this, the expected return remains high, indicating long-term potential.
