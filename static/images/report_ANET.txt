*   **Analysis:** ANET has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  The positive divergence confirms this.  The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a few key insights:
    *   **Alpha:** Generally strong positive Alpha values indicate ANET's returns have consistently exceeded what would be expected based on market movements alone. The significantly negative Alpha value during 2018-2020 is a major outlier, suggesting a period of underperformance relative to the market (this may be an artifact of the 3 year lookback calculation period).
    *   **Beta:** Beta values consistently above 1 suggest that ANET is more volatile than the S&P 500. The Beta has been creeping up in the most recent periods (1.4-1.8), implying the stock has been more responsive to market movements than previously.
    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is strong across most periods, demonstrating substantial growth in the stock's value.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during each period.  While considerable, they appear reasonable given the high CAGRs and Beta.
