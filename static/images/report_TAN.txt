*   The negative change in relative disparity and extremely negative expected return are significant warning signs. The "expected return" figure is exceptionally low and needs careful consideration.  It suggests a model projecting massive underperformance compared to the S&P 500, but the validity of this projection is uncertain without knowing the model's methodology.
*   The significant price change of 3.05 reflects notable volatility.
