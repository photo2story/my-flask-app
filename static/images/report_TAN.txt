*   **CAGR:**  Compound Annual Growth Rate. Shows the average annual growth over the period.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown.  Shows the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, indicating risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500).  A negative alpha means underperformance.
*   **Beta:**  Measures the investment's volatility relative to the benchmark. A beta of 1 means it moves in line with the market. Less than 1 is less volatile, above 1 is more volatile.
*   **Cap(B):**  Unclear what this column represents based on the provided information (most likely Market Capitalization).

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **High Volatility:** TAN exhibits very high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD), consistently above 70%. This signifies high risk.
    *   **Underperformance:** Alpha is frequently negative, especially in recent years, indicating significant underperformance compared to the market.
    *   **Beta Fluctuations:** Beta varies, indicating TAN's correlation to the market changes over time, but it's generally below 1, suggesting it *might* be less volatile than the overall market (but the MDD tells a different story).  The recent negative beta (2023-2025) suggests a slightly inverse correlation.
    *   **Recent Struggles:** The last few periods (2021-2025) show very poor CAGR and highly negative Alpha.

**2) Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 48.33
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 48.33, 'previousClose': 47.25, 'change': 2.29} (2.29% increase)
*   **5-day SMA:** 47.756
*   **20-day SMA:** 47.5725
*   **60-day SMA:** 47.6013

    *   **Analysis:** The price closed higher than all three SMAs (Simple Moving Averages), suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. The recent increase of 2.29% is also significant.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 46.33 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.0038 (Close to zero, indicating little momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.6 (+)  (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -4174.8% (Extremely Negative)

    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **MRI:** A rating of 0.7 suggests a medium level of risk.
        *   **RSI:** The RSI is close to the middle, so a neutral indicator and not providing a clear buy/sell signal.
        *   **PPO:** The PPO is close to zero, indicating no clear momentum.
        *   **Hybrid Signal:** Cautiously optimistic based on MRI
        *   **Divergence:** The recent positive change in relative divergence suggests some short-term upward movement.
        *   **Expected Return:**  The extremely negative expected return is a *major* red flag. This suggests a very pessimistic outlook for long-term investment in TAN.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Mixed Broadcom News:**  Several articles relate to Broadcom, and their impact on AI-focused investments. It is unclear how this is relevant to TAN.
*   **Insider Trading:** Tin Yeow Tan bought a small number of shares in XMH Holdings.
*   **Stock Sale:** Tan Aik Na sold $1.82 million in stock of Wave Life Sciences.
*   **RSI Analysis:** An article discusses RSI levels for Tan Delta Systems plc (TB4).

    *   **Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. Some of it seems irrelevant (Broadcom and Wave Life Sciences).

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:**  *Data not provided.*

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

TAN (Guggenheim Solar ETF) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.  The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistently high risk (high MDD) and frequent underperformance. While short-term indicators (SMAs, recent divergence change) show some potential for upward movement, the extremely negative expected return is a major concern. The news headlines don't provide a clear explanation for the ETF's struggles. Without analyst consensus data, it's difficult to get a complete picture, but based on the available information, **investing in TAN appears very risky.** The positive signal on the Hybrid Signal may require additional investigation as it contradicts the other indicators.
