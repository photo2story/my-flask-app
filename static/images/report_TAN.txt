| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha    | Beta     | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 13.0%    | 70.9%    | -15.0%   | -0.0     | 0.0    |

| 2023-2025  | -80.0%   | 79.1%    | -148.0%  | -0.4     | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates wildly, showcasing the volatility of the solar sector.  Recent periods (2021-2025) show very negative compounded growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high drawdowns indicate significant risk.  Drawdowns around 80% mean that at some point, investors lost 80% of their investment value from peak to trough within those periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha represents the investment's performance relative to the market (S&P 500). Negative alpha, especially in recent years, indicates TAN is underperforming its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility compared to the market. Beta values close to 0 or negative betas suggest TAN has not moved in line with the market over those time periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 50.83
*   **Previous Close:** 50.86
*   **Change:** -0.06
*   **5-day SMA:** 50.496
*   **20-day SMA:** 48.5445
*   **60-day SMA:** 48.1566

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day SMA is above both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which *could* indicate a short-term upward trend. However, the SMAs are relatively close together, suggesting any trend is not strongly established.

**3) Technical Indicators & Signals:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 65.61
*   **PPO:** 0.72
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3711.1

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 1.0 suggests a very high investment recommendation based solely on the MRI model, seemingly contradicting the other negative data.  This could be due to the specific model used for calculating MRI and its potentially lagging nature.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 65.61 suggests that the stock is nearing overbought territory (above 70), but is still within a neutral range.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.72 indicates that the 20-day moving average is slightly above the 60-day moving average, which supports the short-term upward trend idea (mentioned above), but is fairly small.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100%" signal suggests that this particular model recommends investing all available cash into TAN, despite all of the negative data. The mention of "very safe" is highly questionable in the context of the overall data.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend, as indicated.
*   **Expected Return:** The drastically negative expected return (-3711.1%) is extremely concerning and suggests very poor long-term prospects based on the model used.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Broadcom CEO (Hock Tan) Selling Shares:**  Several news articles highlight the sale of Broadcom (AVGO) stock by CEO Hock Tan. While Broadcom is not TAN, this could be a signal of overall market sentiment.
*   **Intel CEO (Lip-Bu Tan) Optimistic:** News about Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan's positive outlook is indirectly relevant as it shows positive news from the tech industry.
*   **Insider Sales:** Further reports of insider sales at Broadcom raise concerns. Insider selling can sometimes be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. While some positive sentiment exists in the tech sector (Intel CEO), the significant insider selling by the Broadcom CEO (same last name of intel ceo - but this is unlikely to be the same person), could be viewed negatively by investors.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   *Information on Analyst Consensus and Targets is missing.*

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

TAN (Guggenheim Solar) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While some short-term indicators suggest a possible, weak upward trend, the long-term outlook appears highly negative. The historical data shows very volatile performance and significant drawdowns.

**Key Concerns:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** TAN has drastically underperformed VOO.
*   **High Volatility and Drawdown:** TAN exhibits significant volatility and large potential losses.
*   **Negative Alpha:** TAN consistently underperforms its benchmark.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The model projects a catastrophic expected return.
*   **Insider Selling:** The news of Broadcom CEO Hock Tan selling a substantial amount of stock can create negative sentiment. (Check to be sure this is the same person.)

**Caveats:**

*   **MRI Contradiction:** The high MRI score contradicts other negative indicators, requiring further investigation into the model's methodology.
*   **Missing Analyst Data:** The absence of analyst consensus and target price information makes a complete assessment difficult.
*   **Broadcom vs. TAN:** News about Broadcom is indirectly relevant, not directly indicative of TAN's performance.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the available data, investing in TAN would be highly speculative and carries significant risk. The long-term outlook appears very poor. Investors should exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering an investment in this ETF. The conflicting signals (high MRI vs. negative return projections) highlight the need for a more in-depth analysis and consideration of additional factors before making any investment decisions.
