|------------|-----------|----------|------------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 13.0%     | 70.9%    | -15.0%     | -0.0   | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:**  The CAGR shows highly volatile performance over the periods, with significant positive returns in some periods (e.g., 2018-2020, 2019-2021) but substantial losses in recent years (2021-2023, 2022-2024, 2023-2025).  This indicates the sector's performance is highly sensitive to market conditions and potentially policy changes.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) consistently above 70% indicates very high risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Negative Alpha values in most recent periods (especially 2021-2025) suggest TAN is significantly underperforming relative to its risk-adjusted expected return.  Positive Alpha in some earlier periods (e.g., 2018-2020, 2019-2021) indicates periods of outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate around 0, indicating TAN's volatility is similar to the market.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 44.7
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 44.65
    *   Previous Close: 47.54
    *   Change: -6.08 (Significant drop)
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day MA: 45.748
    *   20-day MA: 43.9695
    *   60-day MA: 40.9877

**Analysis:** The recent price drop of -6.08 is substantial and concerning.  The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average, but both are above the 60-day moving average. This suggests a potential short-term bounce after a recent pullback, but the longer-term trend (60-day MA) needs to be monitored.

### 3. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 57.85 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.0395 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1249 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Delta Previous Relative Divergence (20-day):** 0.1 (Positive, indicating short-term improvement in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -5296.6 (Extremely negative, suggesting significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 in the long term, if investing today)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the recent price drop and negative performance, the MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended". This is HIGHLY CONTRADICTORY and should be viewed with extreme skepticism. The model might be weighting other factors heavily.
*   **RSI/PPO:** The RSI is neutral, while the PPO is slightly positive, giving mixed signals.
*   **Relative Divergence:** The positive change in relative divergence is a short-term positive, indicating TAN may be starting to close the gap with VOO *slightly*.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-5296.6%) is a major red flag. This indicates a very high degree of risk and potential for continued underperformance.  This figure is almost certainly an outlier or error.  It's important to investigate the calculation of this metric.

### 4-2. Analyst Opinions

*   No analyst consensus data was provided.

### 5. Overall Analysis

**Summary:**

The Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). The recent price drop, coupled with the extremely negative expected return (though this may be an error), raises serious concerns. The high MDD and negative Alpha values in recent years suggest this ETF is a very high-risk investment.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, a *cautious* approach is warranted.

*   **Monitor policy changes:** The sector appears highly sensitive to political and regulatory developments.
*   **Investigate the "Expected Return":** Determine if the -5296.6% return is accurate and reflects a valid calculation.
*   **Consider diversification:** If interested in the clean energy sector, consider diversifying into other clean energy ETFs or individual companies.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Risk Tolerance:** This ETF is not suitable for risk-averse investors.
