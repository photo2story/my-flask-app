2025-12-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided data for TAN (Guggenheim Solar ETF), comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), analyzing technical indicators, and summarizing recent news.

**1) Return Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** Guggenheim Solar (TAN) is an ETF that invests in companies across the globe that are involved in the solar power industry.

*   **Return Rates:**
    *   TAN Cumulative Return: -34.21%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 100.36%
    *   Divergence: -133.9 (Relative Divergence: 1.2)

*   **Analysis:**  TAN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, with a large negative divergence. The relative divergence of 1.2 indicates that the current divergence is near the bottom of its historical range. This means the underperformance is currently as bad as it's been in the past. The table shows periods of strong outperformance (2018-2020, 2019-2021) but also very significant underperformance in recent years (2021-2025). The Alpha, which represents the excess return compared to the market, is largely negative in recent years. The Beta values are close to zero, indicating low volatility.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:** The provided data displays Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD analysis.

    *   **CAGR**: It is notable the CAGR values drop sharply over the time ranges. CAGR is positive for 2015-2017, 2017-2019, and 2018-2020, then turns negative for 2021-2023, 2022-2024, 2023-2025. The negative CAGR in the later years suggests significant losses over the three-year periods.
    *   **MDD**: The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high across all periods, ranging from 70.9% to 82.6%, indicating substantial risk of loss.
    *   **Alpha**: The Alpha values are predominantly negative, especially in the more recent periods, indicating TAN has significantly underperformed relative to its benchmark.
    *   **Beta**: The Beta values are close to zero, suggesting that TAN's price movements are largely uncorrelated with the overall market. This could indicate that the ETF is primarily influenced by factors specific to the solar industry rather than broader market trends.
    *   **Cap(B)**: Cap(B) is consistently at 0.0 across all periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 47.095
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 47.108, Previous Close: 47.63, Change: -1.1
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 47.766
    *   20-day SMA: 48.909
    *   60-day SMA: 46.5428

*   **Analysis:** The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a recent downward trend. However, it's above the 60-day SMA, indicating that the longer-term trend might be more stable, or that the recent downturn is just a short-term fluctuation within a longer uptrend.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.14 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.53 (Negative)
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -5022.2%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:**  While the MRI is high, suggesting investment, this seems contradictory considering the other negative indicators.  It's crucial to understand how the MRI is calculated and whether it's truly reflective of the risk given TAN's specific performance.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 32.14 is nearing oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* suggest a potential for a rebound. However, oversold conditions can persist for extended periods, especially in a downtrend.
    *   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, signaling a downtrend.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** A negative change confirms the recent short-term decline compared to the comparison stock.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag and suggests significant concerns about TAN's future performance based on current trends.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

The news headlines provided appear to be mostly related to Intel and Broadcom, with tangential relevance to the solar ETF TAN. The key headlines are:

*   **[2025-08-18] As Solar Stocks Rally, This ETF May Gleam In Investors' Portfolios - Investor's Business Daily:** This is a positive article suggesting the ETF might benefit from a solar stock rally.
*   The rest of the headlines (related to Intel and Broadcom) seem irrelevant, as they're about specific companies, not the solar industry broadly.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

TAN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The high MDD and negative Alpha values over recent periods underscore the high risk.

*   **Technical Signals:** The technical indicators present a mixed picture. The RSI is approaching oversold territory, *potentially* indicating a future rebound. However, the negative PPO and the recent decline in relative divergence suggest continued downward pressure. The extremely negative expected return is a major concern.
*   **Market Risk Indicator:** The high MRI (0.9) seems contradictory to other indicators and recent performance. Investigate the MRI methodology before relying on this indicator.
*   **News:** The news headlines are generally positive for the solar industry, suggesting that the industry is not in a downtrend. This points towards company-specific risks for TAN.
*   **Recommendation:** **Based on the overwhelmingly negative return divergence, the recent performance, the highly negative expected return, and the short-term downward trend indicated by technical indicators, I would NOT recommend investing in TAN at this time.** The high MRI should be viewed with skepticism given the other data. A deeper dive into the specific holdings within TAN and the reasons for its underperformance is warranted before considering an investment. The single positive news headline is not enough to counteract the numerous negative signals.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Time Horizon:**  The analysis focuses on recent performance.  Long-term prospects for solar energy may be different.
*   **Risk Tolerance:**  TAN is clearly a high-risk investment.
*   **Diversification:**  Consider the role of TAN within a broader, diversified portfolio.
*   **Due Diligence:** Conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.
