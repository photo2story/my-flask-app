*   **CAGR:** Shows the compounded annual growth rate.  Note the wide swings – from +140% to -168%.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown.  This is the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  TAN has very high MDD values, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500).  Negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark. TAN's alpha is overwhelmingly negative.
*   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. A beta around zero suggests very low volatility.  TAN's beta fluctuates, suggesting it is not closely correlated with the overall market.

**Analysis:** TAN's performance is weak across the board with negative Alpha most years, MDD figures are very high, indicating large potential losses.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 48.33
*   **Previous Close:** 47.25
*   **Change:** 2.29 (2.29% increase)
*   **5-day SMA:** 47.756
*   **20-day SMA:** 47.5725
*   **60-day SMA:** 47.6013

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages, which can be interpreted as a short-term bullish signal. The 2.29% increase is noticeable and may indicate a rebound.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment).  This suggests a moderate level of risk currently.
*   **RSI:** 46.33.  This is a neutral reading. An RSI below 30 is often considered oversold (potential buy signal), while an RSI above 70 is considered overbought (potential sell signal).
*   **PPO:** 0.0038.  A slightly positive PPO suggests a slight upward trend in price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-11)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = 0.6 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase).**  This indicates a short-term improvement in TAN's performance relative to its comparison.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -4174.8.  This is a drastically negative expected return. This figure is very suspect and likely an error. The data suggests extreme caution.

**Analysis:** The short-term indicators are mixed, showing potential for a small upward movement. However, the drastically negative expected return is a huge red flag and requires further investigation into the calculation and underlying data.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news articles provided are largely unrelated to TAN or the solar industry. The Broadcom articles mainly concern the semiconductor industry and AI, while the articles about individual stock transactions and RSI levels are not directly relevant to TAN.

**Analysis:** The news feed isn't providing helpful information specific to TAN's performance or the solar industry at this time.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

TAN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and negative alpha. While recent price action shows a slight rebound and positive momentum in the very short term, the long-term expected return is highly negative, raising serious concerns.
