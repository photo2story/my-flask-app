| 2023-2025  | -80.0%   | 79.1%    | -148.0%  | -0.4   | 0.0    |

**Analysis:** TAN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The current divergence is very large at -132.5. The relative divergence being at 1.7 indicates that the current divergence is near its historical low.

The Alpha, Beta analysis shows periods of strong positive alpha (outperformance) during the 2018-2022 period, but very negative alpha recently. The Beta values are mixed, sometimes slightly negative and other times positive, indicating TAN's correlation with the market fluctuates over time, but generally not strongly correlated. The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures consistently show very high risk with the ETF.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 50.83
*   **Previous Close:** 50.86
*   **Change:** -0.06
*   **5-day SMA:** 50.496
*   **20-day SMA:** 48.5445
*   **60-day SMA:** 48.1566

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the previous close, indicating a minor dip. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 65.61
*   **PPO:** 0.72
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-11)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3711.1

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, which seems contradictory given the underperformance and high drawdowns. The RSI is nearing overbought territory (above 70 is typically considered overbought), and the PPO is positive. The Hybrid Signal suggests a full buy, but this conflicts with the expected return and other data points.

The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term positive trend. However, the expected return is incredibly negative, suggesting very poor long-term prospects based on this model.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   Multiple articles reporting on Broadcom CEO (Hock Tan) selling large amounts of AVGO stock.
*   Article highlighting Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan calling 2025 a "defining year."
*   One article notes Broadcom CEO delivered incredible news for Nvidia.

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. The repeated reports of Broadcom's CEO selling large amounts of stock are generally viewed negatively by the market, as it may signal a lack of confidence. The Intel news may or may not have a positive impact on TAN, depending on the solar power implications of Intel's strategies.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   Analyst Consensus: Not Provided

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

TAN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While there are indicators of a potential short-term upward trend (positive PPO, rising SMAs, MRI), the negative expected return is very concerning. The high MDD figures and very negative Alpha values in recent periods indicate high risk. The news regarding the Broadcom CEO selling shares adds a further negative sentiment.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this data, a strong recommendation would be to **AVOID** investing in TAN at this time, despite the high MRI, which seems to be at odds with the other data. The negative long-term expected return, negative Alpha values, and large divergence from the S&P 500 outweigh any potential short-term gains. While the technical indicators suggest a short-term increase, the fundamental data paints a poor picture. More research is warranted before making any investment decisions regarding TAN. Without analyst consensus data, it's difficult to compare the internal analysis of the ETF's health with outside, professional opinions.
