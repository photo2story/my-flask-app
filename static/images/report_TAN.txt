2025-11-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the TAN (Guggenheim Solar) ETF, comparing its performance to the S&P 500 (VOO) and incorporating the provided data and news.

**0. Report Summary**

*   **Performance:** TAN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).
*   **Risk:** TAN demonstrates very high levels of volatility and large drawdowns.
*   **Recent Trends:** Recent price action is mixed, with short-term moving averages above the current price, while the longer-term average is just slightly above the current price.
*   **Market Sentiment:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests medium investment, while technical indicators like RSI and PPO point to potentially oversold conditions but also a bearish trend.
*   **Outlook:** The expected return is negative compared to the S&P 500, with the analyst opinions also suggesting the stock is a hold. Recent news is a mixed bag, with some positive articles about a new solar cycle, but also news of Broadcom and Western Digital CEOs selling shares.

**1. Performance Comparison (TAN vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Guggenheim Solar (TAN) is an ETF that tracks the performance of companies in the solar energy industry.
*   **TAN Cumulative Return:** -36.07%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 94.64%
*   **Divergence:** -130.7 (Relative Divergence: 2.3)

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  While TAN has had periods of strong growth (e.g., 2018-2020), recent years show significant negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently very high, indicating significant risk and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is mostly negative, especially recently, showing that TAN has underperformed relative to its benchmark, even considering its risk (Beta).
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates, but is generally near zero, except for the 2020-2022 period when it reached 1.3, indicating TAN's price is closely correlated with the overall market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 45.94
*   **Last-market:**  {'price': 45.94, 'previousClose': 45.66, 'change': 0.61}
*   **5-day SMA:** 47.24
*   **20-day SMA:** 49.29
*   **60-day SMA:** 46.01

**Analysis:** The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a recent downtrend. The 60-day SMA is near the current price, indicating potential support. The recent price increase of 0.61 from the previous close represents a small rebound.

**3. Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 39.87 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.50 (Bearish Trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (20 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2536.6

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, which is somewhat contradictory given the other indicators.
*   The RSI is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which *could* indicate a potential bounce.
*   The negative PPO confirms a bearish trend.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a very small purchase, deeming it "very safe," which seems inconsistent with the poor performance and volatile nature.  The MRI used in the Hybrid Signal is contradictory to the overall MRI.
*   The recent divergence change confirms a short-term downtrend.
*   The extremely negative expected return is alarming and highlights the risks of investing in TAN from this point.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**
No analyst consensus data provided.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

TAN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and exhibits very high volatility and MDD.  The technical indicators paint a mixed picture. The current price is below the short-term moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  The MRI suggests medium investment, RSI is approaching oversold, and the PPO confirms a bearish trend.  The recent relative divergence change confirms a short-term decline. The extremely negative expected return raises serious concerns about investing in TAN from this point.

The news is a mixed bag. Some articles promote a "new solar cycle" and suggest TAN is a buy, while others highlight general market volatility. The relevance of the CEO stock sales is questionable. The "Hybrid Signal" appears overly optimistic given the overall risk profile.

**Conclusion:**

While there are some potentially positive signs (the "new solar cycle" article, oversold RSI), the overall picture is concerning. TAN is a high-risk, high-volatility investment with a history of underperformance and a negative expected return. Investors should exercise extreme caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in TAN. More research is needed to determine the strength of the "new solar cycle" thesis and to assess the potential for a turnaround.
