*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows wildly fluctuating returns.  Recent years (2021-2025) show significant negative growth.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative, especially in recent years, signifying underperformance compared to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying degrees of correlation (and sometimes inverse correlation) with the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 47.79
*   **Last-market:** price: 47.79, previousClose: 47.57, change: 0.46
*   **5-day SMA:** 48.244
*   **20-day SMA:** 47.5855
*   **60-day SMA:** 47.4379

**Analysis:**

The current price is above both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which could be interpreted as a short-term bullish signal.  However, the 5-day SMA is slightly above the current price, indicating potential short-term downward pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO Index, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 54.37
*   **PPO:** -0.0002
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.3 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -6240.0

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A market risk indicator of 0.7 suggests medium investment risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is at 54.37. An RSI of 54.37 is generally considered neutral, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** A PPO close to 0 suggests the 26-day EMA is very close to the 12-day EMA, indicating neither strong upward nor downward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is confusing as it shows "Very Safe" with a 0% cash holding, and MRI:0.90, which is contradictory to the given MRI of 0.7. This may be an incorrect result from the model.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** A positive change in relative divergence over the last 20 days suggests a short-term upward trend relative to the comparison stock (VOO).
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-6240.0%) is a massive red flag, indicating a very high risk of significant losses if held long-term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**
