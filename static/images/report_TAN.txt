**Here's why a cautious approach is suggested:**

*   **Underperformance:**  The consistent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns about the ETF's ability to generate returns.
*   **Political Sensitivity:**  The solar sector is subject to political and regulatory risks, as highlighted in the news headlines.
*   **Volatility:**  The high MDD indicates significant price swings, making it unsuitable for risk-averse investors.
*   **Negative Expectation:** The negative Expected Return would need a thorough re-evaluation of the business model of the fund.
