This report analyzes Block Inc (SQ), formerly known as Square, a financial technology company providing payment processing, seller tools, and financial services.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Block Inc has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the entire period considered. The cumulative return for SQ is 143.44%, while VOO's is 118.36%, resulting in a difference of 25.1%.  The relative divergence of 7.8% indicates that SQ's performance is in the higher range compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, the provided CAGR data shows significant volatility, with periods of substantial outperformance followed by significant underperformance.  The long-term (multiple year) CAGR is not consistently high, suggesting a high-risk, high-reward investment profile.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $91.48
* **5-day Moving Average:** $89.83
* **20-day Moving Average:** $92.74
* **60-day Moving Average:** $82.05

The current price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend.  It's notably above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.07 (Slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.20 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +0.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1152.7% (This exceptionally high figure needs further context.  It's likely a projection based on specific models and assumptions and should be treated cautiously.  It represents potential excess return compared to the S&P 500, but high risk is implied.)

Block Inc (SQ) presents a high-growth, high-risk investment opportunity.
