**7. Overall Analysis:**

Block Inc (SQ) demonstrates a history of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by both the cumulative return difference and consistently high alpha values.  However, recent performance has been weaker, and the RSI suggests potential near-term price correction.  While the positive PPO and recent relative outperformance show bullish momentum, a cautious approach is warranted given the relatively high RSI and the recent negative CAGR.  The company's revenue and profitability remain strong, but further investigation into recent news and earnings calls is essential for a complete assessment.  Long-term investors should consider the volatility and the modest projected outperformance against the S&P 500.
