Block Inc. (SQ) has outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the entire period considered, with a slightly higher cumulative return. However, the alpha/beta analysis reveals a complex picture.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Block Inc. (SQ) presents a mixed picture. While it has historically outperformed the S&P 500, recent performance has been weak. The high beta indicates significant market risk, and the negative CAGRs and high MDDs in recent years are significant concerns.  While revenue remains strong, the fluctuating ROE and mixed earnings results warrant further investigation. The exceptionally high projected return should be treated with extreme skepticism.  Before making any investment decisions, it is crucial to conduct thorough due diligence, including a deeper analysis of the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects.  The high-risk, high-reward nature of SQ should be carefully considered in the context of your overall investment strategy.
