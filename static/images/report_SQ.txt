**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Block Inc (SQ) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for SQ is 132.32%, while VOO's is 112.05%.  This represents a difference of 20.3%, placing it in the 7.3rd percentile of the historical relative divergence range (max 859.4%, min -45.7%).

The provided Alpha and Beta values suggest consistent outperformance (high Alpha) with significantly higher volatility than the market (high Beta), particularly in 2018-2020.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $87.30
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $92.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $93.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $80.09

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.17 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.46 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 106.6% (Long-term, 2+ years, relative to S&P 500)

The current price of $87.30, being below the moving averages and with a negative PPO, points to a potential continuation of the downtrend, although the RSI is not deeply oversold.  The high expected return suggests potential long-term growth, but this should be viewed in the context of the high volatility and recent underperformance shown in the CAGR data.

EPS showed a growth trend through Q3 2024 but declined in the last quarter. While there's a year-on-year decline in EPS, the actual reported numbers showcase instances of both beats and misses against expectations.  More information (like revenue figures) would be helpful in forming a more complete picture.
