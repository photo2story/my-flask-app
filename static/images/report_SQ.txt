2024-12-13 - Analysis Report
## Block Inc (SQ) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Block Inc (formerly Square), is a financial technology company providing payment processing, seller tools, and financial services.

The cumulative return of SQ (161.29%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (119.76%) by 41.5 percentage points. This places SQ at the 9.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided range. The alpha consistently shows positive returns above the benchmark, highlighting the company's potential for outperformance. However, beta fluctuates significantly, indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market conditions.  The dramatic negative CAGR figures in recent years highlight substantial risk.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows high volatility and inconsistent performance. While Alpha indicates outperformance, the Beta suggests significant market risk.  The extremely high CAGR values in some years are counterbalanced by equally dramatic negative values in others.  This is a crucial point to consider when assessing the risk profile.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $98.19 (Last Market: $95.18)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $96.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $78.03

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, the relatively large gap between the 20-day and 60-day averages hints at recent volatility. The jump from the last market close to the current closing price could be indicating a period of rapid increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 63.56 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.25 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Negative, short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 85.6% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 expected)

The RSI and the price movement suggest a potential upward trend, but the negative PPO and relative divergence indicate some short-term bearish pressure.  The high expected return should be interpreted cautiously due to the significant volatility noted in the historical data. The significant jump from the last market close to the current price ($98.19 vs $95.18) might be a sudden price increase which requires more investigation to understand the trigger.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported EPS has been consistently above expectations except for the quarter ending February 22, 2024.  There is a fluctuating, but generally increasing trend in EPS, although significant quarterly variations exist. This is important to note when assessing future growth prospects. While recent quarters have shown increases in EPS, the data is insufficient to determine a clear revenue growth trend.
