The projected long-term expected return is exceptionally high (1421.5%), but this should be viewed with extreme caution given the volatility demonstrated in historical data.  Further in-depth analysis of the factors driving earnings fluctuations and the sustainability of recent improvements is crucial before making any investment decisions.
