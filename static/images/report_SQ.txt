The cumulative return for SQ is 151.61%, while the S&P 500 returned 118.53%, resulting in a difference of 33.08 percentage points. The relative strength index indicates that SQ is in the 8.7th percentile of its historical performance range compared to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals highly volatile performance. While periods like 2018-2020 showed massive outperformance (507% CAGR and 480% Alpha), recent years have seen substantial declines with negative CAGR and Alpha. This volatility, coupled with a low beta (consistently 0.1), suggests that SQ's performance is largely driven by company-specific factors rather than broad market movements.
