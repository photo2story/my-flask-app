**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Block Inc (SQ), formerly known as Square, is a financial technology company offering payment processing, point-of-sale systems, and other financial services.

The cumulative return for SQ is 177.46%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 122.57%.  This represents a difference of 54.89%.  The relative divergence of 8.49% indicates that SQ's performance is positioned in the higher range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, but this is not necessarily indicative of future outperformance.

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta values show considerable volatility in SQ's performance against the market (represented by the Beta). While Alpha is consistently positive, suggesting outperformance, the high Beta suggests significant market sensitivity and risk.  The dramatic swings in CAGR and MDD from year to year underline the high-growth, high-risk nature of this investment.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $79.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $71.19

The price is currently above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend. However, the recent drop from $92.78 to $89.7 warrants attention.

* **Expected Return:** 0.06% (This figure needs further clarification. Is this the annualized expected return over two years?  The context for this figure is crucial to its interpretation.)

The RSI nearing 70 suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a short-term correction.  The positive PPO reinforces the short-term bullish momentum.  The significant drop from $92.78 to $89.7 could be considered a minor pullback, but ongoing monitoring is recommended.
