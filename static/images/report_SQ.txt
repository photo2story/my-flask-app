Block Inc (SQ), formerly Square, is a financial technology company offering payment processing, seller tools, and cash app services.

The cumulative return of SQ is 138.37%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.62%.  The difference is 20.7 percentage points.

The high maximum divergence (859.2%) and low minimum divergence (-45.8%) suggest considerable volatility in the relative performance of SQ compared to the S&P 500.

The relatively consistent Alpha (around 0.1) suggests some degree of outperformance over the market, while the Beta fluctuates considerably, indicating high sensitivity to market movements.
