However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term recovery after a longer period of decline.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -0.5 – Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.

* **Expected Return:** 95.2% – This high expected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is significantly optimistic and should be treated with caution.  It needs to be considered with the high risk profile implied in the CAGR and Beta analysis.
