The difference is 30.1%, placing it at the 8.4th percentile of the historical range of performance differences (max: 859.4%, min: -45.7%). This suggests that SQ has generally outperformed the market, but its relative performance fluctuates considerably based on the provided historical data.  The alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, indicating a modest outperformance, while beta fluctuates, demonstrating varying sensitivity to market movements.  Note the significant negative CAGR values in recent years indicate substantial periods of underperformance.

* **Closing Price:** $93.78
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $94.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $93.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $79.32

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average and slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term consolidation or minor downward pressure. The price is significantly higher than the 60-day moving average, indicating a recent upward trend after a prior decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.41 (slightly above neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions)

The current price ($93.78) is not exceptionally high compared to moving averages, ruling out an immediate significant price jump or drop based solely on this data.  However, the combination of a slightly bearish PPO, negative relative divergence, and recent price consolidation warrants caution.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Block Inc. (SQ) presents a complex investment picture. While its long-term performance has exceeded the S&P 500 in certain periods and has shown high growth in specific periods,  recent years exhibit considerable volatility and underperformance.  The recent earnings data shows inconsistencies, and the lack of revenue data hampers a comprehensive assessment of growth trends.  Technical indicators are currently mixed, not giving a clear buy or sell signal.  The projected long-term outperformance of 95.2% needs validation through reviewing the source and methodology of this projection.  Crucially, missing information on current market outlook and analyst opinions prevents a complete and accurate investment recommendation. Further due diligence is crucial, including reviewing recent news, analyst reports, and understanding the projection method for the 95.2% long-term return.
