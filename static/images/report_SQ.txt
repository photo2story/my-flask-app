**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $84.0
* **Previous Close:** $86.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $83.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $89.30

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price drop of $2.38 (2.76%) from the previous close signals a negative short-term momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.53 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.53 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.8 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1421.5% (This extremely high figure requires careful consideration, as it may be unrealistic or based on exceptionally optimistic assumptions.  Further investigation into the model used to generate this estimate is necessary.)

The negative PPO and decreasing relative divergence reinforce the bearish short-term outlook.  The substantial price drop should be factored into any investment decision.  The high expected return needs to be validated.

While the company's financials show relatively stable revenue and high profit margins, the inconsistency in earnings and the volatility in ROE warrant further investigation. The extraordinarily high projected long-term return needs validation and a detailed analysis of the underlying assumptions.  Before investing, a comprehensive assessment of the company's competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and risk factors is crucial.
