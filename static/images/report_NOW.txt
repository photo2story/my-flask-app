**Overall Analysis:**

ServiceNow (NOW) has exhibited significant historical outperformance compared to the broader market. Its recent price action suggests a positive short-term trend, supported by strong technical indicators. However, a high RSI reading suggests potential for short-term correction. While the latest earnings report showed revenue growth, the missed EPS target may have caused the recent price pullback. Despite this, the company's strong position in the growing cloud market and continued innovation should drive growth in the long term. Investors should carefully consider both the potential for correction and the long-term growth prospects.
