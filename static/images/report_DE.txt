## Deere & Co (DE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Deere & Co (DE), a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return for DE is 195.38%, while VOO's is 112.74%. This results in a raw difference of **82.6 percentage points**.  The relative divergence of 48.3% indicates that DE's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  While the historical maximum divergence is high (187.8%), the current divergence is relatively moderate within the historical context.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $432.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $418.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $425.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $422.19

The current price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively stable short-term trend.  However, it's important to note the recent price is below its 5-day moving average, indicating a slight downward trend in the very short term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.26 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.05 (Slightly negative, suggesting a potential bearish signal)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.2% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 125% (This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance of the S&P 500. This should be treated with caution as it's a prediction and not a guarantee. The high number may indicate high risk.)

The slightly negative PPO coupled with the RSI near 50 warrants caution, suggesting potential near-term volatility.  The positive relative divergence change indicates some short-term strength. The high expected return highlights potential for significant gains, but also the inherent risk associated with such a high prediction.  A 432.31 price is not exceptionally high or low given the other indicators, making a conclusion of a dramatic price shift inconclusive from just this information.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  There is some inconsistency, notably the duplication of data for 2024-08-29.  A proper analysis requires clarifying and consolidating this data. However, a general observation is high variability of revenue and profit over time.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Deere & Co has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  While recent indicators suggest some short-term uncertainty, the long-term outlook, based on the provided (and potentially uncertain) expected return, appears positive.  However,  it's crucial to note that the high variability in earnings and ROE warrants further investigation.  Thorough due diligence, including a comprehensive review of the company's financial statements and industry outlook, is recommended before making any investment decisions. The provided expected return is extremely high and should be considered a high-risk/high-reward projection and not a reliable prediction.
