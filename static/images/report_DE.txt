* **PPO:** -0.67 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -0.4 – This confirms a recent downward trend in relative strength.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DE has historically outperformed the S&P 500 considerably, presenting a strong long-term investment case supported by its high expected return. However, recent price action and technical indicators point to a near-term bearish trend.  Recent earnings reports exhibit considerable volatility and don't show clear, consistent growth.  The company's financial information indicates overall stability but with noticeable fluctuation in key metrics like ROE. Additional information, such as recent news, analyst ratings, and a deeper dive into the causes of earnings volatility, would provide a more comprehensive assessment.  Considering the higher risk profile suggested by the price movement and earnings fluctuations, a thorough due diligence process and diversification are strongly recommended.
