2024-12-10 - Analysis Report
## Deere & Co (DE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Deere & Co (DE) is a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, construction equipment, and related financial services.  Its cumulative return of 207.37% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 120.73% over the analyzed period. The difference is 86.6%, placing it at the 50.3rd percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates DE's performance has been substantially better than the broader market, though the relative outperformance is not consistently extreme.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $449.41
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $451.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $432.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $415.18

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting minor short-term downward pressure.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a positive longer-term trend.  The last market price of $449.47 is close enough to the closing price to not suggest a significant immediate change.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 72.20 – This suggests the stock is in overbought territory, potentially indicating a short-term pullback might be likely.
* **PPO:** 0.0058 – A positive value, but close to zero, indicating relatively weak momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** -4.8% – This confirms a recent period of short-term price underperformance.
* **Expected Return:** 201.2% –  This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  This high figure requires careful consideration given the already substantial outperformance and the inherent uncertainties of long-term projections.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and Revenue.  There's no clear trend in revenue growth; it fluctuates substantially between quarters. EPS also lacks a consistent trend; for example, from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024 there is an increase, but from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 there is a significant decrease.  More data and context would be needed to analyze "beats" or "misses" versus expectations.  A direct comparison between the two Q3 2024 entries shows inconsistent reporting for revenue and profit.  Data discrepancies need clarification.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows significant fluctuation across quarters. Profit margins remain relatively consistent, hovering around 38-39%, except for a dip in Q4 2023.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates, and ROE exhibits significant volatility, peaking at 12.92% in Q3 2023 and dropping to 7.52% in Q4 2024. This suggests profitability is not consistently strong.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which is not provided in the prompt.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Deere & Co (DE) has historically shown strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent indicators suggest potential short-term weakness. The RSI is in overbought territory, the 20-day relative divergence is negative, and earnings show significant volatility.  While the long-term expected return is high, this projection depends on numerous factors, and should not be taken at face value.  The provided financial data reveals inconsistencies and lacks crucial context such as comparisons to analyst expectations.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain a clearer picture.  The substantial fluctuations in revenue and EPS, coupled with the relatively high RSI, suggest that the recent strong performance may be unsustainable in the short term. Further analysis, including missing news and analyst opinions, is essential for a comprehensive evaluation.  The discrepancy in the Q3 2024 earnings data must also be resolved.
