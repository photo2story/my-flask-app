## Deere & Co (DE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Deere & Co (DE) is a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, construction equipment, and related financial services.  The cumulative return of DE is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 72.1%, placing it in the 43.1st percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500.  This suggests that DE has outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period, but the relative strength has varied considerably.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $418.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $425.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $435.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $420.47

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downward trend.  The relatively close proximity to the 60-day moving average might suggest some support, but further downward movement is possible.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (25.55):**  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory. This could indicate a potential bounce, but it's not a guarantee.
* **PPO (-0.699):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-1.7%):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (152.1%):** This represents the projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, assuming continued outperformance based on historical data. This is a high figure and should be viewed with caution, considering the inherent uncertainties of long-term forecasting.  The current price of $418.18 does not reflect any significant recent price jump or drop warranting special attention.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows volatility in both revenue and EPS.  There's no consistent upward trend.  Noteworthy points:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates significantly between quarters.  There is no clear upward or downward trend.
* **EPS:**  Similar to revenue, EPS shows significant variation.  For example, there is a drop from 10.24 in Aug 2023 to 6.32 in Aug 2024.  Without context (like analyst expectations), it's difficult to label any specific quarter as a "beat" or "miss."  The duplicate entry for Aug 2024 needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation, with a peak in Q2 2024.
* **Profit Margin:** Remains relatively stable and high, generally above 36%.
* **Equity:**  Shows minor fluctuations, generally stable.
* **ROE:**  Highly variable, suggesting some cyclical influence on profitability.

Overall, the financial information suggests a generally profitable company, but the figures highlight the cyclical nature of the agricultural equipment industry.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information about recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This data was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

DE has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but this performance has been volatile.  The current price is below its moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions (RSI) but also bearish momentum (PPO).  Earnings data reveals volatility in both revenue and EPS, lacking a consistent upward trend. Financial statements show consistent profitability but also cyclical variations.  The projected long-term outperformance is significant, but should be treated as a high-level projection subject to substantial risk.  To make a well-informed investment decision, more current information (news, analyst opinions, etc.) is crucial.
