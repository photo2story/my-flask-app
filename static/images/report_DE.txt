| 2016-2018  | 61.0% | 11.6% | 42.0% | 0.2 | 37.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 37.0% | 14.3% | 6.0% | 0.2 | 44.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 62.0% | 14.3% | 34.0% | 0.2 | 70.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 119.0% | 14.3% | 48.0% | 0.2 | 90.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 179.0% | 15.7% | 171.0% | 0.2 | 114.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 29.0% | 15.7% | 5.0% | 0.2 | 107.0 |
| 2022-2024  | -9.0% | 15.7% | -48.0% | 0.2 | 120.0 |

The table shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures for DE, exceeding the S&P 500 significantly in most periods.  However, the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) also highlights periods of substantial risk.  Alpha consistently above zero suggests outperformance against the market benchmark, but Beta near 0.2 implies lower volatility compared to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** $440.44
* **5-day Moving Average:** $444.26
* **20-day Moving Average:** $442.01
* **60-day Moving Average:** $418.09

The price is slightly below its recent short-term moving averages, suggesting a minor downward trend.  The significant gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a more pronounced shift in momentum in recent months.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.51 (Slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.61 (Negative; indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 212.4% (Significantly higher than the S&P 500, reflecting the potential long-term outperformance of DE based on historical data)


Given that the current price of $440.44 is relatively close to recent averages, there isn't significant evidence of a rapid price surge or plummet.  However, the negative PPO and downward relative divergence suggest caution. The high expected return is based on historical data and not a guarantee of future performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-08-29 | 6.32  | $13.15 B     |
| 2024-05-30 | 8.56  | $15.23 B     |
| 2024-02-29 | 6.25  | $12.19 B     |
| 2023-08-31 | 10.24 | $15.80 B     |
| 2024-08-29 | 10.24 | $15.80 B     |


There's a discrepancy in the table; 2024-08-29 appears twice with different EPS values.  Assuming the first entry is correct:

* **EPS Trend:** Fluctuating, with a significant drop from Q2 2024 ($8.56) to Q3 2024 ($6.32).  The data shows inconsistency and requires further verification.
* **Revenue Trend:** Fluctuates, though with signs of seasonality, not a clear upward or downward trend over these four quarters.
