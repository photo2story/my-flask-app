## Deere & Co (DE) Investment Report

This report analyzes Deere & Co (DE), a leading manufacturer of agricultural machinery, offering insights into its performance, valuation, and future prospects.  Information is based solely on the data provided.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Deere & Co's cumulative return (199.86%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (121.78%) over the measured period. The difference is 78.1%, placing it at the 46.1st percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range.  This suggests strong historical outperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $438.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $442.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $443.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $418.65

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting potential downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (27.96):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.69):** Shows a negative momentum, aligning with the price being below moving averages.
* **Recent Relative Divergence (-4.1):** Suggests a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (217.1%):** A high expected return, significantly exceeding the S&P 500, is projected for a long-term (2+ years) investment. This should be treated cautiously given its sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The provided 438.42 price does not trigger a significant "flash crash" scenario based on this information alone.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows volatility in both EPS and Revenue.

* **EPS:** Fluctuates significantly between quarters, with a high of $10.24 in 2023-08-31 and a low of $6.25 in 2024-02-29.  The duplicate entry for 2024-08-29 should be investigated for data accuracy.
* **Revenue:** Also fluctuates, ranging from $12.19B to $15.80B.  Revenue is generally higher in the latter half of each year.
* **Overall:** There's no consistent upward or downward trend readily apparent; further analysis beyond the limited data is necessary.  No information is given on whether these figures beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation but generally remains above $10B.  Seasonality seems to be present.
* **Profit Margin:** Generally high and consistent, hovering around 37-39%.
* **Equity:** Demonstrates some fluctuation but remains largely stable above $20B.
* **ROE:**  Highly variable, ranging from 5.45% to 10.87%, suggesting cyclical profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or analyst opinions were provided.  Therefore, no information is available on recent market outlook or analyst sentiments.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Deere & Co has shown significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests potential downward pressure. Technical indicators point towards oversold conditions, but the negative PPO and relative divergence signal short-term weakness. While long-term expectations are positive, short-term volatility is evident in the earnings data.  The financial information indicates strong profitability margins, but variable revenue and ROE suggest cyclical business trends.  The absence of recent news hinders a more complete assessment of current market sentiment and future prospects.  Further investigation into data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) is recommended.
