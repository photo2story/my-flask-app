## Deere & Co (DE) Stock Report

This report analyzes Deere & Co (DE), a manufacturer of agricultural machinery and equipment, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Deere & Co's cumulative return (242.37%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (130.06%).  The difference is 112.3%, placing it at the 58.7th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong outperformance, though the relative strength is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $465.90 (Last market: $467.61)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $460.46
* **20-day Moving Average:** $417.11
* **60-day Moving Average:** $408.49

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, though the price is slightly below the last market close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (82.47):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (1.74):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (NaN):** The missing value prevents a clear interpretation of recent relative strength.  However, the high RSI suggests potential weakness.
* **Expected Return (193.5%):** This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming the current trend continues, although it is important to realize that historical performance does not guarantee future returns.  The 467.61 price being greater than the closing price doesn't suggest a significant event (like a rapid increase or decrease) as the difference is minimal.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates significantly quarter-to-quarter, reaching highs of $15.80B and lows of $12.19B.  No consistent upward or downward trend is easily discernible.
* **EPS:** Similarly, EPS shows fluctuation between $6.25 and $10.24. There is no clear trend visible from the presented data.  A comparison to earnings expectations would provide a more complete picture but is not available here.
* **Note:** The table includes a duplicate entry for 2024-08-29.  This redundancy prevents definitive conclusions.

This section requires additional information,  specifically, news released within the last two days regarding earnings, market outlook, and analyst opinions to complete the analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Deere & Co (DE) has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the provided historical data. However, recent technical indicators (high RSI) suggest the stock might be overbought and prone to a short-term correction.  Earnings data exhibits variability, with both revenue and EPS showing considerable fluctuation.  The lack of recent news and detailed analyst opinions limits a comprehensive assessment of current market sentiment and future prospects.

Further analysis is needed concerning consistent trends within revenue, EPS, and the overall economic climate before forming concrete investment conclusions.  The provided data is insufficient to ascertain any specific beats or misses in regard to earnings expectations.
