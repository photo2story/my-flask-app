2025-01-22 - Analysis Report
Here's an analysis of Deere & Co (DE) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Deere & Co (DE) is a manufacturer of agricultural machinery and heavy equipment.

The cumulative return of DE is 216.44%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.36%.  The difference is 96.1%, placing it in the 54.9th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong relative performance, though the relative strength is not consistently high based on the provided data.

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistently positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), though Beta (market sensitivity) appears to be unusually high at 126 across all years (this seems like an error in the data provided, as Beta usually ranges from 0-2).  A thorough investigation of the data source is needed to confirm this unusual beta value.   The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates, highlighting the cyclical nature of the agricultural equipment industry.  High maximum drawdowns (MDD) highlight the risk involved.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $463.15
* **5-day Moving Average:** $443.78
* **20-day Moving Average:** $428.21
* **60-day Moving Average:** $424.95

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The recent price change of $1.69 reflects a modest increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 69.14 –  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered overbought above 70), suggesting potential short-term price correction.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.02 – Positive value indicates upward momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +7.2% –  Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

* **Expected Return:** 99.4% –  This exceptionally high expected return (over a 2+ year horizon) needs careful scrutiny.  It's crucial to understand the assumptions and methodology behind this forecast.  It is considerably higher than typical market expectations.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent with the date 2024-08-29 appearing twice.  There seems to be a duplication error.  Assuming the duplicated entry is removed, the analysis shows fluctuations in EPS and revenue, likely reflecting the cyclical nature of the agricultural sector.  A more thorough analysis would require a full review of the financial statements and accounting practices.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-08-29 | 6.32  | $13.15B       |
| 2024-05-30 | 8.56  | $15.23B       |
| 2024-02-29 | 6.25  | $12.19B       |
| 2023-08-31 | 10.24 | $15.80B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals strong revenue and profitability, with profit margins consistently above 36%.  Equity shows some fluctuation, and Return on Equity (ROE) varies, indicating periods of higher and lower profitability. Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying drivers of these fluctuations.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Deere & Co shows strong performance compared to the S&P 500, with a significantly higher cumulative return.  However,  high maximum drawdowns and the unusual Beta value (requiring further investigation) highlight substantial risk. Positive PPO and strong revenue and profitability metrics are positive signs. The high RSI and projected expected return require additional analysis to assess their reliability and to understand any underlying assumptions. The seemingly erroneous data points in the earnings data need clarification.   A comprehensive valuation considering industry-specific factors, macroeconomic conditions, and potential risks is crucial before making any investment decisions.

**8. Disclaimer:** This analysis is based on the limited data provided and should not be considered financial advice.  Conduct thorough independent research and consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions. The unusually high Beta value and exceptionally high projected return warrant further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions.
