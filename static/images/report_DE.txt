**7. Overall Summary:**

Deere & Co (DE) has historically outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating strong profitability and consistent positive alpha.

The high expected return is promising but depends on the continuation of past trends, which is not guaranteed.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and a more detailed analysis of cyclical factors affecting the business are recommended before making investment decisions. A thorough risk assessment considering the high RSI and the increasing beta is crucial.
