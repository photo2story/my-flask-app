* **5-Day Moving Average:** 396.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 402.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 400.32

The price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively stable trend. The 5-day moving average is lower, indicating some recent price consolidation or minor decline.
