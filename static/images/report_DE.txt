**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $400.09 (Last Market: $400.06)
* 5-Day Moving Average: $397.53
* 20-Day Moving Average: $402.64
* 60-Day Moving Average: $400.63

The stock price is slightly below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The 5-day average further supports this, though the difference is not significant.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 46.98 (Slightly below neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* PPO: -0.1 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* Relative Strength Index (20-day): -3.71 (Negative, indicating recent short-term weakness)

The combination of a relatively low RSI, negative PPO, and negative recent relative strength divergence suggests a potential short-term bearish trend. The current price ($400.06) is near the moving averages, so there's no indication of a significant sudden price movement (up or down).  The expected return of 41.4% over the long term (2+ years) suggests significant potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500, provided the long-term growth trend continues.

Further analysis is needed to interpret these results fully, including comparing them to analyst expectations.
