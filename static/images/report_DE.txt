The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

However, this figure is provided without explanation of methodology and should be viewed with caution.  The current price of $418.00 does not signal an immediate sharp upward or downward movement based solely on its position relative to moving averages.

There's a noticeable decline in revenue and EPS from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024, followed by a slight recovery in Q2 and a further decline in Q3 2024.
