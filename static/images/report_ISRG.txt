A thorough review of recent news, including earnings reports and analyst opinions, is crucial to determine the current market outlook and assess the risk-reward profile for future investment. The long-term outlook based on past performance and financial strength is positive, but short-term volatility should be anticipated. The projected 2.3% expected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is significant, though the short-term risk needs to be considered.


**8. Recommendation:**

Based on the currently available data, further information is needed before making a concrete recommendation.  A deeper dive into recent news, especially earnings reports compared to expectations and analyst ratings, is crucial.  The combination of the overbought RSI and the relatively strong long-term performance suggests a cautious approach. A potential strategy could involve waiting for a slight pullback before considering investment or implementing a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate risk.  Furthermore, considering the inherent risk in investing in individual stocks vs diversified ETFs, a balanced portfolio should be considered.
