ISRG exhibits a strong track record of growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500.

The slightly negative short-term indicators (PPO, recent relative divergence) warrant monitoring, but they don't overshadow the fundamentally strong position of the company.  For long-term investors (2+ years), ISRG presents a compelling opportunity with a significant potential for outperformance.  However, it is crucial to conduct further research and consider individual risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data requires clarification.
