*   **Alpha:**  ISRG's alpha shows periods of both outperformance and underperformance compared to the market.  From 2015-2019, ISRG generated positive Alpha, indicating risk-adjusted outperformance.

*   **MDD:** High MDD across all periods suggests significant volatility and potential for large drawdowns.  Investors should be aware of this risk.
*   **Cap(B):** ISRG's market capitalization has generally grown, reflecting the company's expansion. However, there was a dip in 2020-2022, possibly due to market conditions or company-specific challenges.
