*   **Beta:** Trend of increase, indicating rising sensitivity to market movements.  A Beta consistently above 1 suggests ISRG is more volatile than the market.

*   **5-day SMA:** 561.06
*   **20-day SMA:** 564.08
*   **60-day SMA:** 522.79

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The large divergence of the 60-day SMA from the current price suggests that this recent upward trend is substantial and relatively new. The 'change' value also indicates a recent positive move.

**3) Index Indicators**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 52.71 (Neutral – neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.34 (Slightly negative, suggesting a potential weakening of the upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (Very Safe) - Suggests a bullish outlook according to the automated trading algorithm.

*   **Expected Return:** 28.5% (Significant, suggesting potential for strong long-term gains)

**Analysis:** The indicators present a mixed picture.  The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is neutral. The PPO is slightly negative.  However, the "Hybrid Signal" is strongly bullish and the expected return is high. The recent relative divergence change and the PPO indicates caution is warranted in the short term.
