## Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) is a company that manufactures and sells da Vinci surgical systems and related instruments and accessories.  The cumulative return of ISRG is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between ISRG and VOO is 181.2 percentage points, placing it at the 96.3rd percentile of historical relative performance. This indicates a substantial outperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 consistently indicate that the outperformance isn't explained by systematic market risk (beta).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values ranging from 71% to 188% across different time periods (2015-2025), indicating strong historical growth. However, the Alpha is consistently reported as 0.0, implying that any excess returns are unrelated to systematic market risk. This needs further investigation as such consistently high CAGR’s are usually accompanied by a significant beta value. The relatively low and stable Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values suggest the stock's performance is relatively stable despite high growth. The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth.

* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** +3.6 – This confirms a short-term upward trend.

**7. Overall Summary:**

ISRG demonstrates strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Financial indicators suggest robust revenue growth, high profitability, and increasing equity.  Technical indicators show a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment.  The consistently high CAGR raises questions regarding the reported alpha values of 0.0.  While the high expected return is promising, investors should consider the inherent risks associated with any investment, particularly given the high historical growth rates which are not always sustainable in the long term. Further investigation into the underlying drivers of this outperformance (relative to the consistently reported 0.0 alpha),  and a more thorough analysis of the financial statements and qualitative factors are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data in the recent earnings section requires clarification.
