    *   **Existing holders:**  Consider trimming positions based on the Hybrid Signal's recommendation.
    *   **Potential buyers:**  Wait for confirmation of a trend reversal (e.g., price moving above the 20-day moving average) before initiating a position.
    *   **Long-term investors:** If the long-term thesis remains intact (e.g., belief in continued adoption of robotic surgery), consider dollar-cost averaging into the stock over time to mitigate short-term volatility.
