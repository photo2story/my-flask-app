* **20-Day Moving Average:** $487.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $531.57

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term sideways trend or minor pullback.  The 60-day moving average is significantly higher, indicating a recent downward trend.  The last day's price increased by $1.92, indicating a small positive movement.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Recent financial performance is positive, showing growth in revenue and consistent high profit margins.  However, the stock's price is currently experiencing a short-term downward trend. While the long-term expected return is high (47.9%), this projection needs further substantiation.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook, but the overall financial strength of the company warrants further consideration.  Further investigation into data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) is needed for a complete and accurate assessment.  The high beta suggests that ISRG's price is likely to be more volatile than the market.  Investors should consider their risk tolerance before investing in ISRG.
