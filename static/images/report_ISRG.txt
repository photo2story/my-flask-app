**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for ISRG over several years, ranging from 47% to 91%.  However, the recent years (2021-2023) experienced negative returns.  The beta fluctuates, but generally shows a higher beta than 1 in recent years. This suggests that ISRG is more volatile than the market.  Alpha is positive in most periods, signaling potential outperformance relative to the market.  However, the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in some periods highlights the risk associated with the stock.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $466.655
* **Last Market Price:** $466.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $483.251
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $492.5017
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $548.6641

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The small positive change from the previous close ($0.67) is not significant enough to suggest a major reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.24 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.24 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.2 (Short-term upward trend, but context is needed to assess significance given other indicators)
* **Expected Return:** 34.5% (Over a long-term horizon, exceeding the S&P 500's projected return.)

The combination of a high MRI, negative PPO, and RSI near but not below 30 suggests caution.  While the short-term relative divergence change is positive, the overall picture is mixed.  The high expected return should be taken with caution and context given the risk profile of ISRG.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue growth, but EPS growth is less consistent.  There are some inconsistencies, which need to be checked against official sources to ensure accuracy (two identical entries for 2024-10-18 and 2024-10-18)


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-18 | 1.59 | $2.04B      |

| 2024-10-18 | 1.18 | $1.74B      |  <-- Duplicate entry?


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows consistent and healthy revenue growth and high profit margins. Equity is also growing, but ROE (Return on Equity) has been declining slightly in recent quarters. The profitability appears to be strong.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, current indicators suggest a potential short-term bearish trend, with the price below key moving averages and some bearish technical signals.  While the company's financials are strong, the high risk indicator and recent negative return warrant caution. The long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, remains potentially positive.  However,  a thorough investigation of the duplicate earnings data, and further analysis of market conditions and the company's future prospects are needed before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility of the stock should be carefully considered.
