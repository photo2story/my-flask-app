## Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) is a company that manufactures and sells da Vinci surgical systems and related instruments.

The cumulative return for ISRG is 325.95%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 203.8%, placing it at the 91.4th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a substantially higher return compared to the benchmark index.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) ranging from 21% to 220% across various periods, suggesting strong historical performance.  However, the Alpha is consistently 0.0, indicating that the outperformance is not explained by factors beyond market risk. The Beta values fluctuate, reflecting changes in the company's sensitivity to overall market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $584.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $599.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $556.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $540.82

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend.  The significant drop from the previous close ($608.66 to $584.05) indicates a considerable price decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 69.88 – This suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory, potentially indicating a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.99 –  A positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -8.6% – This signifies a recent decline in relative strength.

The price drop of $24.61 (approximately 4.04%) from the previous close is noteworthy and contributes to the negative 20-day relative divergence.  It does not, however, indicate a significant "crash" or dramatic change in the recent price.

The expected return of 20.8% over the long term (2+ years) represents a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming historical trends continue.  However, future performance is never guaranteed.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent revenue growth over the past several quarters, with EPS also generally increasing. However, there's a discrepancy in the 2024-10-18 entry, showing duplicate data.  Further investigation is needed to clarify this duplication.  Assuming one entry is accurate, the trend indicates a healthy financial picture for the company.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is consistently above $1.7B, with strong and relatively stable profit margins averaging around 67%. This indicates a healthy and profitable business model.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing, showing company growth. Return on Equity (ROE) is relatively stable, fluctuating slightly around 4%.  Further analysis is needed to contextualize these ROE numbers within the industry.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG has demonstrated exceptional historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  The strong and consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins, and increasing equity suggest a fundamentally sound company.  However, the recent price decline and the RSI nearing overbought territory suggest potential short-term volatility. The high Beta suggests increased sensitivity to market movements.  The 0.0 alpha suggests the outperformance is potentially attributable to systematic risk rather than unique company-specific advantages.  Long-term investors might find this a compelling opportunity based on historical performance and financial health but should be prepared for potential market fluctuations given its Beta.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and a more detailed industry comparison of ROE would improve the analysis.
