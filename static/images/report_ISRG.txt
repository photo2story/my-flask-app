## Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Assessment:**

ISRG, Intuitive Surgical Inc., is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of robotic-assisted surgery systems.  The company exhibits a significantly higher cumulative return than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  However, recent performance shows signs of deceleration.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **ISRG Cumulative Return:** 120.09%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** 37.52%
* **Relative Divergence:** 40.9% (This indicates ISRG's outperformance relative to its historical range against VOO. It doesn't imply a 40.9% superior return.)

The provided alpha and beta data show ISRG consistently outperforms the market (positive alpha) with high beta (systematic risk), especially in the 2017-2021 period.  However, recent years show a decline in CAGR, and even negative returns in 2020-2023.  The high beta reflects ISRG's sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $508.13
* **5-day Moving Average:** $485.17
* **20-day Moving Average:** $487.88
* **60-day Moving Average:** $530.47

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 52.92 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.68 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 40.7% (Long-term projected excess return over S&P 500)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO suggests bullish momentum and the relative divergence shows a short-term uptrend, the RSI is near neutral, and the price is below its moving averages.  The high expected return is promising but depends on maintaining a long-term perspective and market conditions.

**5. Financial Information:**

No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data were provided, hindering a comprehensive financial analysis.  This crucial information is needed to assess ISRG's profitability and financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting strong growth in earlier periods, but recent performance has been less impressive.  The company's high beta indicates significant market sensitivity. Technical indicators present a mixed signal, with bullish momentum tempered by recent price declines and the absence of key financial data limits a conclusive assessment.  The high long-term expected return is promising, but investors need to consider the current market environment and the potential risks associated with ISRG's high beta. Further investigation, including accessing complete financial statements and clarifying data inconsistencies, is necessary for a robust investment decision.
