**0) Report Format**

I will present the raw data first, followed by a concise analysis.

**1) Return Rate Comparison: ISRG vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **ISRG: Intuitive Surgical Inc.** - A company that designs, manufactures, and markets robotic products to improve clinical outcomes of patients through minimally invasive surgery.
*   **Cumulative Return (ISRG):** 111.57%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 10.7
    *   Relative Divergence: 35.5 (This means the current divergence is in the bottom third of its historical range.)

**Analysis:**

ISRG has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative return.  However, the relative divergence of 35.5 suggests that the current level of outperformance is relatively low compared to its historical range. This could indicate that ISRG is currently less overvalued, or more undervalued, compared to how it has been in the past.
