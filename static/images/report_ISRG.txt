* **60-day Moving Average:** $555.59

The combination of overbought RSI and negative PPO suggests caution despite the short-term upward trend.  The high expected return, however, remains attractive for long-term investors.

ISRG has a strong track record of outperforming the S&P 500, exhibiting significant growth in revenue and high profit margins.

The high projected long-term return and generally positive financial indicators make ISRG a potentially attractive investment for long-term investors with a tolerance for moderate risk. However, investors should monitor the company's earnings reports closely to verify the revenue and EPS data consistency and to assess future growth potential.  The correction of the duplicated entry in the earnings data is crucial for a complete analysis.
