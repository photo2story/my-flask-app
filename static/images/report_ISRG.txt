*   **Weaknesses/Risks:** The stock has exhibited significant volatility (high MDD). Recent relative underperformance (negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence). The RSI approaching overbought levels warrants caution. Analyst's current hybrid signal suggests a somewhat cautious approach, but this could be a short-term adjustment.
