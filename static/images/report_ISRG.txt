**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Intuitive Surgical Inc. is a leading developer and provider of robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery systems.  Over the observed period, ISRG significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 113.31% compared to VOO's 66.36%. The difference of 46.95% highlights ISRG's superior performance.  However, the relative divergence of 41.9% indicates this outperformance is within the range of historical fluctuations relative to the market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows that ISRG consistently exhibited high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) from 2015 to 2021, ranging from 68% to 91%. While the CAGR fell to negative values (-3% and -5%) in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023, respectively, it rebounded to positive territory (26% and 34%) in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025.  The Alpha values generally indicate outperformance relative to the benchmark, becoming particularly strong in the last two periods of the data (1.0), while Beta values show high market sensitivity, especially from 2017 onwards.  The significant market sensitivity (high Beta) suggests ISRG's performance is strongly correlated with overall market trends.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) fluctuates but remains within a reasonable range considering the high growth exhibited, except for the significant drawdown in 2021-2023.  This underlines the inherent risk in high-growth stocks.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 68.0% | 56.5% | 38.0% | 0.0 | 43.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 77.0% | 63.4% | 60.0% | 0.0 | 57.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 81.0% | 63.4% | 52.0% | 0.3 | 70.6 |
| 2018-2020  | 47.0% | 63.4% | 22.0% | 0.2 | 97.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 91.0% | 63.0% | 37.0% | 0.3 | 128.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -3.0% | 69.9% | -9.0% | 0.3 | 95.1 |
| 2021-2023  | -5.0% | 72.9% | -22.0% | 1.0 | 120.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 26.0% | 72.9% | 9.0% | 1.0 | 187.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $493.60
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $485.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $492.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $544.57

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium term.  The recent price change of $0.83 (0.17%) is a minor increase, not significant enough to suggest a major reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.75 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.54 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 52.2% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 expected)

The MRI indicates a high-risk environment. While the PPO suggests bullish momentum, the RSI and relative divergence change point towards a short-term bearish trend. The high expected return over the long term (2+ years), however, remains attractive and justified by the historical outperformance and positive long term trends.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue growth, though with some minor fluctuations.  EPS has increased since the last year. It's notable that there is a duplicate entry for 2024-10-18. This needs clarification to ensure accurate analysis.  More historical data is needed for a complete trend analysis.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2024-10-18 | 1.59 | $2.04B     |

| 2023-10-20 | 1.18 | $1.74B     |
| 2024-10-18 | 1.18 | $1.74B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profit margins have remained consistent and strong over the past year. Equity has been steadily increasing and ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, remaining within a relatively healthy range.  The data suggests strong financial health and profitability.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.41B | 68.04% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG has demonstrated a strong track record of outperforming the S&P 500, although recent performance has shown signs of slowing. While current technical indicators present a mixed picture, the company's fundamental strength, supported by consistent revenue and profitability, suggests a positive outlook.  The high expected return over the long term warrants consideration, but the high beta implies significant market risk.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for substantial gains against the high volatility associated with this stock.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data point and a more detailed analysis of historical trends and competitive landscape is recommended.
