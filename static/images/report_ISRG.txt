## Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Intuitive Surgical Inc. is a leading developer and manufacturer of robotic surgery systems.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), ISRG has significantly outperformed over the observed period. The cumulative return of ISRG is 286.89%, while VOO's is 117.56%.  This results in a difference of 169.3 percentage points.  The relative divergence places ISRG at the 90.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating strong historical outperformance.

The provided CAGR data shows consistently high growth rates, ranging from 21% to 132% depending on the period, although the most recent period's growth is likely still affected by recent market fluctuations.  The relatively low beta values (close to 0) suggest that ISRGâ€™s performance is largely independent of the overall market movements.  However, the provided alpha data is consistently 0.0, which requires further investigation into the methodology used for calculating alpha.  This could be an issue with data or calculation error, and does not necessarily reflect true alpha.



**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $527.22
* **Last Market Price:** $537.02
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $529.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $539.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $519.44

The stock price is currently slightly below its 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, it remains above its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a more positive longer-term trend. The difference between the closing price and last market price should be investigated to determine if it reflects an end-of-day price or a different data point.  A larger discrepancy would require further investigation.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 39.27 (Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.)
* **PPO:** -0.65 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.3% (Short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** 113.5% (This represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years), assuming this forecast is accurate and reliable).  The accuracy and reliability of this forecast should be checked.


The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish sentiment.  The negative relative divergence change reinforces the short-term bearish trend.  The last market price ($537.02) being higher than the closing price ($527.22) suggests a potential slight upward correction.  However, a substantial increase (a 'sharp rebound') is not clearly indicated based solely on these limited data points.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows relatively stable revenue, with fluctuations within a relatively tight range over the past year. Revenue has shown a slight upward trend, albeit with minor quarter-to-quarter variation.  EPS also shows slight fluctuation, though it is notable that there is no clear upward or downward trend. There is a slight decrease in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024.  Without access to expectations, it is impossible to determine whether any specific quarters were "beats" or "misses."  More data is needed for further detailed analysis.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been consistently above $1.74 Billion over the past 5 quarters, showing slight growth.  Profit margins are high and consistently above 65%, indicating strong profitability.  There's a slight fluctuation, but nothing significantly concerning.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  However, current technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend. While the long-term outlook (based on the provided expected return of 113.5%) appears positive, caution is warranted due to the recent downward trend and limited data regarding analyst opinions and news. The recent earnings data shows relatively stable revenue and high profit margins, suggesting a fundamentally sound business.  However, more context is needed for a thorough evaluation.  Further investigation is necessary to understand the divergence between the consistently high CAGR and the low reported alpha.  The limited provided data is insufficient for a completely robust and conclusive analysis.
