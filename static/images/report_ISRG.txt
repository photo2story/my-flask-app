## Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) is a company that manufactures and sells the da Vinci surgical system, a robotic surgery system.

The cumulative return of ISRG (295.42%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (120.73%). The difference is 174.7%, placing it at the 92.8th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500.  This indicates ISRG's superior performance relative to the broader market over the period considered.

The provided CAGR data shows consistently high growth, albeit with some fluctuation, particularly a lower return in 2020-2022.  The Beta consistently reflects a higher than average market sensitivity (higher than 1).  However, the Alpha is consistently near zero, suggesting the outperformance isn't due to factors outside market movements (though this is limited by the data provided).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $538.86
* **5-day Moving Average:** $545.72
* **20-day Moving Average:** $540.82
* **60-day Moving Average:** $511.12

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price is negligible.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.98 – Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** -0.25 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** -1.7 – Indicates a recent weakening in relative performance compared to the market.

The 20-day relative strength change of -1.7 points to a recent short-term decline. The closing price of $538.89 is not significantly different enough from the last market price to indicate a dramatic price swing (neither a sharp jump nor a sharp drop).  The expected return of 107.9% over the long term (2+ years) significantly surpasses the S&P 500, supporting the historical data showing ISRG's outperformance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG demonstrates a strong track record of outperforming the S&P 500, particularly over the long term, as evidenced by both its cumulative return and its consistently high CAGR.  While short-term indicators show some weakness, the long-term growth trend appears positive.  However, the relatively low and fluctuating ROE warrants further investigation into capital efficiency. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive assessment of current market sentiment.  Further analysis of earnings reports (with the inclusion of expectations) would improve the accuracy of the analysis.
