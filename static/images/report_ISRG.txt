## Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) is a company that manufactures and sells the da Vinci surgical system, a robotic surgical system.

The cumulative return of ISRG is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns is 221.1%, representing a substantial outperformance.  The relative divergence index of 98.9% indicates that ISRG's performance is at the high end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  While this shows significant historical outperformance, it doesn't guarantee future returns.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) for ISRG, ranging from 7% to a remarkable 221% over various three-year periods.  However, the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) also fluctuates significantly, indicating periods of substantial risk. Notably, Alpha consistently registers as 0.0, suggesting that the outperformance might not be entirely due to skill, but possibly due to higher systematic risk indicated by the beta values. The beta fluctuates around 0.0,  in the historical data which implies little sensitivity to the overall market. However, it's crucial to consider that historical beta doesn't predict future market sensitivity.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $599.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $553.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $539.60

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the recent price change of -$0.29 indicates a minor daily decline.

* **RSI:** 83.75 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.39 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG demonstrates a strong track record of growth and significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, its high valuation (as evidenced by high RSI and past MDDs) introduces risk. While recent earnings show continued growth, the provided data contains inconsistencies (duplicate entries).  The current price is above its key moving averages, but the overbought RSI and negative relative divergence suggest a potential near-term correction.  Long-term investors might find the expected return attractive, but careful consideration of risk is necessary.  Further analysis with accurate and complete data is crucial for a more robust conclusion.  The seemingly low beta in the historical data should be carefully examined, considering that historical beta does not predict future market sensitivity.  External factors such as competition and regulatory changes should also be considered before making any investment decisions.
