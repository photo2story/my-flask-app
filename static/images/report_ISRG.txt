The recent price increase is encouraging. However, further investigation is needed to clarify the duplicate earnings entry from October 18th, 2024.  Continued monitoring of key financial indicators and market sentiment is recommended.  A long-term investment approach seems warranted given the expected 22.3% excess return.
