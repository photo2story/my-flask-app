**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** ISRG's CAGR has fluctuated significantly, with strong performance in earlier periods (2015-2019) and more recent periods (2023-2025) and weaker performance in between.

This *could* indicate a short-term bullish trend, but the relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day SMAs suggests that the trend is not strong.
