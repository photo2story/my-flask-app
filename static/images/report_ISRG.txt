**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close Price:** $572.47
*   **Previous Close:** $561.89
*   **Change:** $1.88
*   **5-day SMA:** $561.06
*   **20-day SMA:** $564.08
*   **60-day SMA:** $522.79

**Analysis:**

*   The price closed higher than the previous close, indicating a positive move.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are above the 60-day SMA.  This *could* suggest a short-term upward trend after a longer period of consolidation (but needs more confirmation). The 20-day SMA being so close to the current price provides stronger support.
*   The difference between the 5-day and 60-day SMA is significant, highlighting the recent upward price movement.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment) - Suggests a moderate level of risk and a potentially suitable time for investment.
*   **RSI:** 52.71 - Neutral; Not overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30).
*   **PPO:** -0.34 - The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being negative suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a *possible* short-term downward trend or consolidation.  The value is quite close to zero, meaning the potential downtrend is not strong.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)" - This suggests a strong buy recommendation with a monthly investment strategy. The higher MRI value (0.90) associated with the signal points to a high investment grade.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 28.5% - A high expected return suggests potentially strong future performance compared to the S&P 500.

**Analysis:**

*   The neutral RSI and slightly negative PPO don't provide a strong directional signal, but combined with the upward SMA relations, it suggests a consolidation phase.
*   The Hybrid Signal and the Expected Return present a bullish outlook.
*   The recent relative divergence change indicates a short-term bearish signal.
