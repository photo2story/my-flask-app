* **20-day Moving Average:** $489.52
* **60-day Moving Average:** $532.10

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term.  The recent price increase of $2.22 (from the previous close) might be a temporary bounce.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.09 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)

* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 50.0%  This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment, assuming the forecast holds. The recent price increase of $2.22 does not significantly alter this long-term perspective, though it should be monitored closely.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, consistently outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent data shows some signs of short-term bearishness. The high profit margins and consistent revenue growth are positive indicators.  The provided 50% expected long-term return should be considered cautiously and depends on future market conditions and the company's continued success.  Investors should monitor the RSI, PPO, and moving averages closely for short-term trading decisions.  The long-term outlook remains positive, contingent upon sustained strong performance and market sentiment.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent negative CAGR and the slight dip in ROE would be beneficial. The duplicate earnings data point requires clarification.
