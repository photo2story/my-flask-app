* **Return Difference:** 195.7% (This represents a substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 87.9% indicates that ISRG's performance lies in the upper 87.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for ISRG, significantly exceeding the market (as evidenced by the large alpha values in recent years).  However, maximum drawdowns (MDD) also remain relatively high, highlighting the inherent volatility of the stock.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 37.91  (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce but not a guaranteed signal.)

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG has a history of strong performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, it's a volatile stock with substantial risk. While recent price action shows a decline and some bearish technical indicators, the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by its strong fundamentals (high profit margins, revenue growth, and increasing equity). The significant expected return suggests long-term potential, especially for those with a longer-term investment horizon and risk tolerance.  However, investors should monitor the company's performance closely, particularly given the recent price drop and the need for clarification on the earnings data.  The high beta should also be factored into any investment decision.
