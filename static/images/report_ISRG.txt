## Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) is a company that manufactures and sells da Vinci surgical systems.  The cumulative return of ISRG is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between ISRG and VOO as of the last data point is 175.0, placing it at the 93.1 percentile of its historical range of divergence (max 188.6, min -7.9).  This indicates ISRG has substantially outperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 throughout the years suggest the outperformance isn't explained by systematic risk alone.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $539.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $540.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $541.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $514.77

The price is slightly below the 5- and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some minor short-term downward pressure. However, it is notably above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.45 - This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, though not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.35 - This negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -3.4% - Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 108.4% - This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming consistent past performance.  This should be viewed with caution, as past performance does not guarantee future results.  The current price of $539.58 does not trigger a specific alert for a rapid upswing or downswing; it sits within the context of recent price movements.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a generally upward trend in both revenue and EPS, though with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations:

* **Revenue:**  Revenue has generally increased from quarter to quarter, with some minor decreases.  The trend indicates growth.
* **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS has also generally increased, again with some fluctuations.
* **Notable Changes:**  No significant negative or unexpected trends are visible.  Precise comparisons against expectations are impossible without those figures.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable but shows year-over-year growth.  Profit margins are consistently high but have fluctuated slightly throughout the provided period. This suggests healthy profitability.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is increasing, indicating company growth.  Return on Equity (ROE) shows some variability but generally remains positive, suggesting efficient utilization of shareholder equity.  However, a recent decrease in ROE warrants further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  The prompt only mentions "recent earnings news," but does not provide the content of such news.  Information on recent market outlook and analyst opinions is also missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ISRG has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While short-term indicators suggest some downward pressure, long-term trends show growth in revenue, EPS, and equity.  The high profit margins and generally healthy ROE provide further positives.  However,  recent relative divergence and a slight decrease in ROE merit attention.  More detailed information on recent news and analyst opinions is needed for a complete picture.  The 108.4% projected long-term return is substantial but should be considered cautiously, as it relies on assumptions about future performance that may not be realized.
