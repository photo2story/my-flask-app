**Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) presents a mixed picture. The company has strong fundamentals as shown in the recent financial results and a revenue and profit margin generally on the rise. The stock is expected to outperform the S&P 500 over the long term. However, ISRG has been underperforming the S&P 500. The short-term moving averages and the recent news suggest some recent price weakness and investor concern. The MRI is suggesting a "Medium Investment Recommended" level of risk. Based on Alpha and Beta, Intuitive Surgical has generally moved with the market, it has underperformed, especially in the recent timeframes. It appears that the recent 2023-2025 results have a negative alpha and high CAGR and MDD, meaning that, even with high growth, this company might have high risk and not necessarily perform well over the S&P 500. A final recommendation will need more data such as competitor analysis, recent events or news, and more in-depth financial study of the business.
