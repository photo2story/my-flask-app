## Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) Stock Report

**1. Performance Summary and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Intuitive Surgical Inc. is a company that manufactures and sells the da Vinci surgical system, a robotic surgery system.

The cumulative return of ISRG is 317.69%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 119.94%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 197.7%, placing it in the 88.8th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance compared to the market benchmark. The provided alpha values consistently show zero, suggesting that the outperformance may not be entirely attributed to alpha (manager skill) but rather beta (market risk) and company-specific factors.  Further analysis of the company's fundamentals would be needed to fully explain this large performance divergence.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $572.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $582.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $561.85
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $543.81

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend. However, it remains above its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.  The recent price drop of -$0.25 from the previous close reflects a minor daily decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 65.14  (Moderately overbought, but not excessively so)
* **PPO:** -0.0081 (Slightly negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -11.2% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 22.3% (Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500)


The relatively high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, however, other indicators such as the slightly negative PPO and recent negative relative divergence suggest caution.  Given the modest recent price drop, the negative change in price doesn't represent a drastic event like a sharp decline. The substantial expected return highlights the potential for long-term growth, exceeding the projected S&P 500 returns significantly.

ISRG demonstrates a strong track record of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Financial statements reveal consistent revenue growth and high profit margins. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term pullback, and some indicators suggest the stock may be slightly overbought. Despite this, the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by strong financials and a projected significant outperformance.  Further due diligence, including competitor analysis, and a more comprehensive risk assessment is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The seemingly consistent zero alpha in the provided data requires further investigation into the statistical methodology used and potential factors affecting the results.
