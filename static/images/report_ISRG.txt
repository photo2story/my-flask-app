*   **CAGR:** Compounded Annual Growth Rate.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown (peak-to-trough decline during a specified period).
*   **Alpha:** A measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis.  Positive alpha indicates outperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:**  A measure of volatility relative to the market. A beta of 1 indicates the stock moves with the market; beta > 1 is more volatile, beta < 1 is less volatile.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions.

*Analysis:*

*   ISRG has experienced fluctuating performance. Earlier periods (2015-2019) showed strong CAGR and positive Alpha.  More recent periods (2018-2023) show negative CAGR and negative Alpha, suggesting underperformance on a risk-adjusted basis.  The most recent period (2023-2025) has shown recovery in CAGR but still negative alpha.
*   The Beta has generally increased over time. From 2021 to 2024, a beta is 1.7 suggests that the stock has become more volatile than the market. The decrease in Beta for the most recent period (2023-2025) indicates a decrease in volatility.
*   High MDD figures across all periods indicate significant price volatility and risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 555.92
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 542.32, Previous Close: 547.36, Change: -0.92
*   **5-day SMA:** 564.98
*   **20-day SMA:** 564.21
*   **60-day SMA:** 509.34

*Analysis:*

*   The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, which suggests a recent downtrend or pullback.  The price has recently dropped (542.32 from a previous close of 547.36).
*   The 60-day SMA is significantly lower than the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, implying that the stock was trading much lower a few months ago and has since seen a considerable increase. The longer-term trend is still positive, but the short-term trend is showing weakness.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 44.56 (Neutral - Not overbought or oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.78 (Bearish - Indicates a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -3.9 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 23.4% (Long-term excess return potential)

*Analysis:*

*   The RSI of 44.56 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The negative PPO and negative divergence change align with the observation of a recent short-term downtrend from the moving average analysis.
*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a bullish investment strategy. Despite other indicators suggesting caution, the AI-driven signal recommends a full investment of available cash due to a perceived high level of safety, and suggests monthly investments. This seems to contradict the short-term downtrend.
*   The significant "Expected Return" suggests that the AI predicts Intuitive Surgical will strongly outperform the S&P 500 in the long run.
