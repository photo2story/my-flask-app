**7. 종합 분석**

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)은 최근 S&P 500보다 저조한 실적을 보였지만, 최근 주가 상승 추세, 긍정적인 애널리스트 평가, 높은 기대 수익률은 잠재적 성장 기회를 시사합니다. 높은 변동성을 나타내는 높은 최대 하락률(MDD)과 투자 시 신중해야 합니다. 최근 실적 발표 및 애널리스트 의견은 회사의 재무 건전성과 미래 성장 전망을 더욱 뒷받침합니다.

**In summary:** While ISRG has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, the recent upward price movement, positive analyst ratings, and high-expected return suggest potential growth opportunities. The high maximum drawdown (MDD), indicating high volatility, warrants caution when investing. Recent earnings releases and analyst opinions further support the company's financial health and future growth prospects.
