The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 71.40. This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term pullback might be likely.  However, in a strong uptrend, RSI can remain elevated for extended periods.
