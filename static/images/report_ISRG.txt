### 7. 종합 분석 (Overall Analysis)

ISRG presents a mixed picture. While historically outperforming the S&P 500, recent performance has lagged behind, as indicated by the negative absolute and relative deviation, short-term moving averages and recent underperformance. The RSI approaching oversold levels, combined with a low MRI and a high Expected Return, might indicate a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors. However, it's crucial to investigate the "Major Business Developments/Regulatory Changes/Market Events" mentioned in the news headlines to fully understand the current risk factors. Financial data shows healthy revenue growth and strong profit margins, suggesting a solid underlying business. However, declining EPS and recent negative Alpha figures raise concerns.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. Further research into the recent news and market events is essential before making any investment decisions. If the underlying business fundamentals remain strong and the negative short-term trends are temporary, ISRG could represent a potential long-term investment opportunity.
