The company's earnings per share (EPS) also exceeded estimates by $0.15, coming in at $1.39. However, it is important to consider that the company's earnings have been fluctuating in the past, with a loss recorded in Q1 2024. This fluctuation suggests potential volatility in future earnings.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

While AMGN's recent earnings were positive and indicate potential growth, the stock's performance lags behind the S&P 500. Overbought conditions highlighted by the RSI and recent negative relative divergence suggest potential short-term correction. However, positive momentum indicated by the PPO and the strong 5-year expected return of 7.55% suggest long-term potential. Investors should monitor the stock's short-term price fluctuations closely due to its overbought condition and consider a long-term investment strategy based on its strong expected return.
