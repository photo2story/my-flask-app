The RSI indicates the stock is currently in overbought territory. However, the positive PPO and Expected Return point towards potential growth. The negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence suggests a short-term downward trend, which could be a factor for near-term price movement.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Revenue | 
|---|---|---|
| 2024-08-07 | 1.39 | 8.39 B$ |  (Estimate: 1.25)

AMGN exceeded analysts' earnings estimates for the most recent quarter, demonstrating solid financial performance. However, the negative earnings in the previous quarter highlight potential challenges in revenue growth. Continued monitoring of earnings reports and guidance is recommended.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

AMGN is a company with a strong track record of growth. Despite its recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500, positive technical indicators and strong earnings suggest potential for future growth. However, the stock currently sits in overbought territory, and the negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence suggests a potential for short-term downward movement. 

**6. Conclusion:**

AMGN shows potential for long-term growth, particularly considering its positive financial performance and strong brand recognition. However, investors should remain cautious about the current overbought conditions and potential for short-term volatility. Further monitoring of company performance, upcoming earnings releases, and market sentiment is recommended for informed investment decisions.
