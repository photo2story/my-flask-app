**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This data is crucial for assessing the company's financial health and future prospects.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEVA has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, with a negative long-term expected return. While recent positive CAGR and positive PPO suggest some short-term improvement, the inconsistent earnings, lack of key financial data, and high market sensitivity (beta) raise serious concerns.  The negative long-term expected return is a major red flag.  Further investigation into the company's fundamentals, strategy, and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The lack of key financial data severely hinders a thorough assessment.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution.
