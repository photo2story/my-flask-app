TEVA's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While TEVA showed a 37.35% return, VOO achieved 82.57%, resulting in a substantial negative divergence.  The provided data shows a high degree of volatility and risk, requiring a cautious approach to investment.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd ADR is a generic pharmaceutical company.  The cumulative return of TEVA (37.35%) lags significantly behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 82.57%, a difference of -45.2%.  This places TEVA in the 56.5th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to VOO (based on the provided min/max range).

The alpha/beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance.  While recent years (2022-2024) show high CAGR and positive alpha, earlier periods consistently exhibit negative CAGR and negative alpha, suggesting underperformance relative to the market (Beta consistently above 1 indicates higher volatility than the market).  Market capitalization fluctuates considerably.

* **Closing Price:** $14.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.74

The closing price is above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential resistance level. The recent price change of +3.01% from the previous close shows a notable jump.

* **PPO:** 1.07 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -58.1% (This indicates a significant negative expected return relative to the current valuation and potential future performance.  This should be interpreted cautiously and further investigated)

The significant recent price increase of 3.01% warrants further investigation into the potential catalysts for this surge.  The negative expected return of -58.1% for long-term (2+ years) investment, relative to the S&P 500, highlights substantial risk.

Further due diligence and a thorough understanding of the drivers behind the recent price surge and the company's long-term prospects are crucial before considering any investment.  The current data suggests a high-risk investment with potentially significant downside.  The provided -58.1% expected return, while concerning, requires further examination of the methodology used to derive this figure.  Investors should seek professional financial advice before making any investment decisions.
