**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The extremely low RSI (11.78) and negative PPO (-1.49) strongly suggest an oversold condition and bearish momentum. The recent relative divergence indicates a short-term downward trend. Given the {'price': 12.935, 'previousClose': 14.16, 'change': -8.65} data, a sharp price drop has occurred. The expected return of -47.7% is extremely negative, highlighting the high risk associated with the investment and substantial underperformance.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy might be considered, but only after carefully reviewing the reasons for consistent underperformance.
