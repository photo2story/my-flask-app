Analysis:  The consistently negative alpha across multiple years demonstrates TEVA's persistent underperformance relative to the market benchmark (S&P 500).  While the recent years show positive CAGR, the negative alpha suggests this growth might be due to broader market trends rather than company-specific success. The high beta values (especially in earlier periods) indicate a high sensitivity to market fluctuations.

* **Last Market Price:** $15.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $15.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $15.86

* **PPO:** -0.13 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -101.0% (This exceptionally negative figure suggests a highly pessimistic outlook for future returns relative to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year horizon.)

Analysis: While the RSI suggests the stock is oversold, the negative PPO and significant negative expected return signal caution. The price decrease from the previous close (-$0.13) is minor and doesn't indicate a significant sudden price movement (no evidence of a crash).

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEVA's performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  While recent CAGR shows improvement, negative alpha, declining profitability, negative ROE, and a highly negative long-term expected return paint a concerning picture.  Although the RSI suggests oversold conditions, which could indicate a short-term bounce, the fundamental weaknesses need to be addressed before a positive long-term outlook can be considered.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the declining profitability and negative ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data strongly suggests a high-risk investment.
