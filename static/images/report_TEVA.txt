* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $16.66

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price increase of 1.04% from the previous close could indicate a short-term bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk) – indicates significant market volatility.
* **RSI:** 31.45 (Oversold) – suggests the stock may be oversold, but not necessarily a strong buy signal.
* **PPO:** -0.96 (Negative) – indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -9.9% (Short-term Downward Trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -45.5% (vs. S&P 500) –  This indicates a significant underperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.


The recent 1.04% price increase represents a minor upward movement; however, given the overall negative indicators, it's premature to characterize this as a significant "rebound".


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.39 | $4.33 B     |

| 2024-02-12 | $0.06  | $3.85 B     |

Recent earnings show a mixed picture, with both positive and negative EPS figures.  Revenue remains relatively stable, but the fluctuating profitability is a concern. The significant negative EPS in recent quarters raises substantial concerns about the company's financial health.

| 2023-12-31 | $7.51B | 5.72%   |

Equity has decreased over the past year and the negative ROE across recent quarters indicates poor return on investment. This is a very serious negative signal for the company's financial health.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEVA's stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, and while recent quarters saw some improvement in revenue, profitability and ROE indicators are alarmingly negative.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, with the stock currently trading below its moving averages and showing an over-sold RSI.  The high market risk indicator and negative long-term expected return reinforce concerns.  The negative EPS in recent earnings reports further contributes to the bearish outlook.  Unless there is a significant improvement in the company's financial health and performance, the long-term outlook for TEVA remains negative.  Further investigation into the specific reasons for the negative earnings and declining ROE is crucial before considering any investment.  The high beta suggests that any market downturn would heavily impact the stock price.
