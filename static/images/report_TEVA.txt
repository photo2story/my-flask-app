Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd ADR is a global pharmaceutical company engaged in the development, manufacturing, and marketing of generic and specialty medicines.  TEVA's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The -43.7% difference highlights a substantial underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of $14.0 shows a slight increase from the previous close ($13.31).  However, it's trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The price is 5.18% up from the previous closing price, this indicates a recent bounce.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 39.41 suggests the stock is potentially oversold, potentially indicating a short-term buying opportunity. However, the PPO value of 0.1673 indicates a relatively weak bullish momentum. The positive change in relative divergence (+2.5) suggests short-term upward pressure. The MRI of 0.435 suggests a low to medium risk level.  The significant negative expected return of -56.4% for long-term investment is a major concern, highlighting considerable underperformance compared to the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings show fluctuating performance with both positive and negative EPS. Revenue remains relatively stable, but the consistent negative EPS in several quarters raises concerns about profitability.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-06 | -0.39 | 4.33 B$ |
| 2024-07-31 | -0.75 | 4.16 B$ |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.12 | 3.82 B$ |
| 2023-11-09 | 0.07 | 3.85 B$ |
| 2024-02-12 | 0.06 | 3.85 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has generally been stable, but profit margins have shown some decline in recent quarters, indicating potential challenges in profitability.  More concerning is the negative Return on Equity (ROE) in the last few quarters, suggesting that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investment.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $4.23B | 50.15% |
| 2024-09-30 | $4.33B | 49.60% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.16B | 48.61% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.82B | 46.37% |

| 2024-09-30 | $6.07B | -7.21% |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.36B | -13.30% |
| 2024-03-31 | $7.28B | -1.91% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEVA's performance is currently weak relative to the S&P 500. While some technical indicators might suggest short-term buying opportunities (oversold conditions), the consistently negative Alpha, declining profit margins, negative ROE, and significantly negative projected long-term return paint a concerning picture.  The recent price bounce might be a temporary effect.  Investors should carefully consider the substantial risks associated with investing in TEVA, particularly the expectation of significant underperformance compared to a broad market index like the S&P 500. Further fundamental analysis and a thorough understanding of the company's future prospects are crucial before any investment decision.
