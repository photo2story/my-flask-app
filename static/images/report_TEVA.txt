* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.85

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average but significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of 2.07% from the previous close shows a recent upward swing.

| 2023-12-31 | $7.51B     | 5.72%     |

Negative Return on Equity (ROE) in recent quarters is a serious concern, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

TEVA has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the past periods, showing high volatility and negative alpha. While recent price action shows a slight upward trend, financial data reveals inconsistent profitability and negative ROE.  The significantly negative expected return (-57.8%) strongly advises against long-term investment unless substantial changes in the company's fundamentals occur or the market significantly shifts its valuation of TEVA.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative ROE and fluctuating earnings is crucial before considering any investment.  The high beta suggests significant market risk as well.
