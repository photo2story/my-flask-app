* **20-Day Moving Average:** $15.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $16.80

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of 4.99% from the previous close might signal a temporary bounce.

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence change points to a bearish outlook in the short term.  The high MRI reinforces this risk assessment.  The projected long-term underperformance of -46.6% relative to the S&P 500 is a serious concern. The recent price increase is likely not enough to change the overall negative sentiment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEVA significantly underperforms the S&P 500, showing consistent negative alpha and volatile beta.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold market but still bearish.  Financial statements reveal declining profitability and negative ROE.  The high market risk indicator and negative long-term expected return highlight significant investment risks.  While the recent price increase might signal a short-term bounce, the overall outlook for TEVA remains negative based on this data.  Further investigation is required before considering any investment.  The negative expected return suggests this is not a good long-term investment unless significant fundamental changes occur within the company.
