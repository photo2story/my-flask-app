## Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd ADR (TEVA) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Preliminary Analysis:**

TEVA's cumulative return (31.57%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return (76.18%).  The current relative divergence of -44.6% indicates TEVA underperformed VOO considerably.  However, this needs to be considered within the context of its historical volatility and risk profile.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd ADR is a generic and specialty medicines company.  The provided data shows TEVA consistently underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, evidenced by the negative alpha values.  The high beta values (mostly above 10) indicate significantly higher volatility than the market.  While the most recent period (2022-2024) shows a high CAGR (123%), this is likely influenced by market conditions and doesn't guarantee future performance.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values highlight substantial risk associated with TEVA.  The cumulative return difference between TEVA and VOO as of the last data point is -44.6%.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.65
* **5-day Moving Average:** $13.55
* **20-day Moving Average:** $14.55
* **60-day Moving Average:** $16.25

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent 1.64% increase (from $13.43) might be a short-term fluctuation.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.83 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions, but not necessarily a strong buy signal)
* **PPO:** -0.31 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.1 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -57.6% (This extremely negative expected return requires further investigation and context. It likely reflects the historical underperformance and risk profile).  A negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 suggests it would continue to underperform significantly over the long term (2+ years), if the past trends continue.

The recent price increase, while noticeable, needs to be viewed cautiously in the context of overall bearish technical indicators and significantly negative expected returns.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEVA's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over various periods, showing negative alpha and high beta. Recent earnings are volatile, and profitability is inconsistent.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish sentiment, although the RSI is close to oversold territory.  The extremely negative expected return warrants serious caution.  The high volatility and risk, as reflected in the high beta and MDD, should be carefully considered.  While the recent price increase might be encouraging, a long-term investment in TEVA carries considerable risk given its past performance and current financial indicators.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price increase and future prospects is recommended before making any investment decision.  The negative expected return (-57.6%) is a critical point requiring further analysis to validate its source and assumptions.
