* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.74

The last market price shows a significant jump ($16.19) compared to the closing price, suggesting a recent price surge.  The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential short-term bearish trend.

* **RSI:** 48.98 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.07 (Positive, suggesting potential bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -58.1% (This indicates a significant expected loss compared to a benchmark. The timeframe for this projection is unclear.)  This negative expected return, coupled with historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500, is a significant concern.


The last market price's significant increase requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.  This sharp increase contradicts the negative expected return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.39  | $4.33 B      |

| 2024-02-12 | $0.06   | $3.85 B      |

Recent earnings show fluctuating EPS, with several quarters reporting losses.  Revenue remains relatively stable but doesn't show significant growth.  This lackluster performance likely contributes to the low expected return.

| 2023-12-31 | $7.51B | 5.72% |

Negative ROE in recent quarters is a serious concern, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEVA's performance has been volatile and inconsistent, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 in the long term. While recent price action shows a surge, the negative expected return and consistently negative ROE raise significant concerns.  The company's earnings show inconsistent EPS and stable but not growing revenue.  A long-term investment should be approached cautiously, given the current financial indicators and history of underperformance.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price surge is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The sharp increase in price from the previous close to the last market price is also a cause for concern and needs further analysis.
