Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the sustainability of recent positive performance and the causes of past underperformance is crucial. A detailed analysis of the company's competitive landscape, debt levels, and future growth prospects is necessary for a thorough evaluation.  The -35.1% expected return requires clarification on the used benchmark.  The provided data reveals volatility and risks associated with TEVA.
