TEVA is currently showing signs of significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by negative alpha, substantial negative expected return, and a relatively low price compared to moving averages. Recent earnings show volatility and declining profit margins, and financial statements reveal decreased equity and negative ROE.  The RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, but this alone is insufficient for a buy recommendation. The significant negative price change requires investigation of the underlying cause.  Further fundamental analysis is necessary to determine if this is a buying opportunity or if the negative trends are likely to persist.  Given the significant underperformance, high volatility, and negative financial indicators, caution is advised.  Investors should thoroughly investigate the reasons for the recent price drop and the company's future outlook before making any investment decisions.
