The table shows significant volatility in TEVA's performance, with negative CAGR in several periods and large maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The consistently negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark, while the beta values suggest varying levels of market sensitivity.  The recent surge in CAGR (2022-2024) needs further investigation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.80
* **Previous Close:** $14.85
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $14.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $15.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $17.43

The stock is trading below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The recent price drop of -7.07% suggests a potentially significant negative event impacting the stock price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 10.14 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.75 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.9 (Short-term upward movement, but still bearish overall)
* **Expected Return:** -46.1% (This is a short-term expectation, considering the recent drop. Long-term expectation needs a more detailed model considering underlying business fundamentals).
* **Long-Term S&P 500 Outperformance:**  Given the current underperformance and high risk, long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is highly uncertain and unlikely without a significant fundamental shift in the company's prospects.


The extremely low RSI and negative PPO confirm bearish sentiment.  The large negative expected return reflects the recent price drop. The high market risk indicator reinforces the need for caution.

| 2023-11-09 | $0.07  | $3.85 Billion |
| 2024-02-12 | $0.06  | $3.85 Billion |

Recent earnings show inconsistent profitability, with several quarters reporting negative EPS. This volatility and the trend of negative earnings raise concerns about the company's financial health. Revenue has been relatively stable but hasn't shown significant growth.

**5. Financial Information:**

| 2023-12-31 | $7.51B    | 5.72%   |


Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins have been declining.  More importantly, the Return on Equity (ROE) is negative in several quarters, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital. This is a significant red flag.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEVA is currently exhibiting weak performance, characterized by significant underperformance against the S&P 500, negative EPS in recent quarters, declining profit margins, negative ROE, and bearish technical indicators.  The recent price drop further exacerbates the negative outlook. While there was a period of strong CAGR, the overall trend shows volatility and inconsistency.  Before considering any investment,  a thorough investigation into the underlying reasons for the negative EPS and declining ROE is crucial.  Given the current data, a long-term investment in TEVA carries significant risk.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the company's strategic initiatives and competitive landscape, is strongly recommended before any investment decision.
