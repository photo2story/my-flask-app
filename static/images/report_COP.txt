**8. Overall Analysis:**

A thorough review of recent news and analyst sentiment, coupled with a comparison to earnings expectations for the most recent quarter, is essential for determining the next probable direction of the stock price.  The high long-term expected return makes it an interesting candidate for long-term investment, but the short-term risks associated with overbought territory and potential market volatility in the energy sector should be carefully considered.
