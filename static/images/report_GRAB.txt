### 7. 종합 Analysis

**Summary:**

Grab has shown substantial revenue growth and improving profitability (as evidenced by recent EPS performance) but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Technically, the stock shows a recent downward trend. Recent news has been mixed, and analyst opinions are generally positive.

**Conclusion:**

While the analyst consensus remains positive, the underperformance against the S&P 500 and the negative expected return suggest caution. Investors should weigh the potential for future growth (as indicated by revenue increases and analyst optimism) against the risks of continued underperformance. The hybrid signal to reduce holdings also warrants attention. The contrasting viewpoints from analysts and technical indicators suggest a more in-depth research into external factors such as Vietnamese economic outlook and competitive analysis.
