Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information for Grab Holdings Ltd (GRAB) with analysis:

**0) Report Structure**

*   First, I'll present the numerical data directly.
*   Then, I'll provide an analysis of that data.

**1) Return Rate Comparison: GRAB vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Grab Holdings Ltd is a Southeast Asian technology company providing ride-hailing, food delivery, and digital payment services.

*   **Returns:**
    *   GRAB Cumulative Return: -4.62%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 46.30%
    *   Divergence: -50.9 (Max: 21.6, Min: -57.6, Relative Divergence: 8.5)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Underperformance:** GRAB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return shows a stark difference.
    *   **Divergence:** The current divergence is -50.9, which is close to its minimum historical divergence. The relative divergence of 8.5 indicates that the current divergence is near the most negative it has been within the observed range. This means GRAB is performing exceptionally poorly relative to the S&P 500, compared to its own history.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis (and related metrics):**

|            | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -28.0%  | 62.7%   | -29.0%  | 1.2  | 13.8   |
| 2022-2024  | 21.0%   | 50.8%   | 1.0%    | 1.2  | 19.3   |
| 2023-2025  | 41.0%   | 30.3%   | -21.0%  | 1.1  | 20.4   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR Volatility:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) varies significantly across the periods, from -28% to +41%, indicating inconsistent performance.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is substantial in all periods, suggesting significant risk and volatility.  Even with the 2023-2025 period's positive CAGR, the 30.3% MDD highlights potential downside risk.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha is a measure of how much a stock outperforms (or underperforms) its benchmark.  The negative alpha in the 2021-2023 and 2023-2025 periods shows underperformance relative to its expected return based on its beta. The 2022-2024 period has a slightly positive alpha.
    *   **Beta:**  Beta consistently hovers around 1.1 to 1.2. This suggests that GRAB's price tends to move in the same direction as the market (S&P 500), but with slightly more volatility.
    *   **Cap(B):**  The market capitalization has grown over the periods, implying some degree of investor confidence or company expansion, despite the volatile returns.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 5.08
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 5.09, Previous Close: 5.08, Change: 0.2
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 5.078
    *   20-day SMA: 5.089
    *   60-day SMA: 5.4657

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Short-Term Stability:** The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are very close to the current price, suggesting short-term price stability.
    *   **Downward Trend (Implied):** The 60-day SMA is significantly higher than the shorter-term SMAs and the current price. This suggests that the stock price has been trending downwards over the past two months, and the current price is still below this longer-term average.
    *   **Small Price change:** The change of 0.2 is relatively small, reflecting a lack of large price volatility.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 45.19
*   **PPO:** 0.3997
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (176 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 2.4 (+): Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return (%):** -369.2%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, indicating moderate risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 45.19 is neutral. It's not overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30), suggesting no strong momentum in either direction.
    *   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.3997 is relatively low, indicating that the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, but the difference isn't significant. This suggests weak upward momentum.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 90% of cash" signal is interesting. The "Safe" designation is qualified by the MRI of 0.8. It suggests a strategy of gradually entering the stock, even with the risks. The recommendation to invest a fixed dollar amount ($1,000) monthly follows a dollar-cost averaging strategy, which can be a reasonable approach for volatile stocks.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The 2.4 (+) short-term divergence increase aligns with the slight recent price increase. This suggests a short-term upward trend, however, the general market still is not confident for the future.
    *   **Expected Return:** The -369.2% "Expected Return" is extremely negative. This is a critical signal that the model projects very poor long-term performance relative to the S&P 500 if invested today.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Summary:**
    *   GRAB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and this underperformance is near its historical worst.
    *   The stock demonstrates high volatility (high MDD) and a beta slightly above 1, indicating it amplifies market movements.
    *   While recent news is mixed, there's a focus on Grab's profitability push and some analyst upgrades.
    *   The analyst consensus is strongly positive with substantial upside price targets.
    *   However, the projected "Expected Return" is extremely negative, which strongly indicates that it is not a good investment choice.
    *   The RSI is neutral, and short-term moving averages suggest recent price stability with the price rebounding upwards (short-term divergence change).

*   **Key Considerations:**

    *   **Risk Tolerance:** GRAB appears suitable only for investors with a very high-risk tolerance due to its volatility and underperformance.
    *   **Conflicting Signals:** There are conflicting signals. The positive analyst consensus clashes with the negative "Expected Return" and the historical underperformance. Investors should investigate the reasons for the analyst optimism.
    *   **Profitability:** The company's ability to achieve and sustain profitability is crucial. Investors should closely monitor financial reports and company guidance.
    *   **Due Diligence:** Given the mixed signals and high risk, thorough due diligence is essential before investing in GRAB. Understand the analysts' reasoning behind their ratings, and reconcile them with the negative "Expected Return" figure. Consider whether Grab can overcome the market skepticism implied by the negative expected return.
