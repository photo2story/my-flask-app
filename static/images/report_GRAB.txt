The recent news is mixed, with positive news regarding institutional investment and strategic partnerships, offset by analysis questioning valuation.

**Conclusion:**

*   GRAB presents a mixed picture. The technical indicators and historical performance suggest caution.

*   The very high negative expected return makes the investment very risky and should not be disregarded due to other mixed signals.
