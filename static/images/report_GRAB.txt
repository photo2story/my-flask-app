**Recommendations:**

Despite the seemingly high investment recommendation based on the MRI and the strong analyst consensus, the negative cumulative returns, high MDD, short term relative divergence decline, and the extremely negative expected return are concerning.

The positive news around innovation and potential undervaluation provides some hope, but needs to be balanced against the poor performance history and negative expectations.

It is crucial to investigate *why* the expected return is so negative. There may be errors in the calculation or assumptions. If there is a strong belief in the company's long-term potential, investors should conduct further due diligence, considering Grab's market position, competitive landscape, and growth strategies.
