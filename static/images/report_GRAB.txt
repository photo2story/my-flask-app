### 7. 종합 Summary

GRAB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative relative divergence.

The high volatility (MDD) and news suggesting significant market events/regulatory changes add to the risk profile.

**Recommendation:**  Based on the current data, a cautious approach is warranted.  The recent improvements in earnings and revenue are encouraging, but the significant underperformance, negative expected return, and high volatility warrant further investigation before considering a long-term investment. Monitor news and financial reports closely for any changes in the company's trajectory.
