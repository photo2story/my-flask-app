*   **Return Rate vs. S&P 500:** GRAB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The cumulative return of -7.13% contrasts sharply with the S&P 500's 48.79% return.
*   **Divergence:** The divergence of -54.2 indicates a substantial gap between GRAB's performance and that of the S&P 500. A relative divergence of 4.8 suggests the divergence is currently near its minimum historical level.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   **2020-2022:**  Significant underperformance with a high MDD. The negative alpha suggests GRAB underperformed its benchmark (likely S&P 500) even considering risk.
    *   **2021-2023:** Similar underperformance and high MDD to the previous period.
    *   **2022-2024:**  Positive CAGR, but the Alpha of 0% suggest that GRAB's return matches its benchmark.
    *   **2023-2025:**  High CAGR, but a negative alpha suggest underperformance given risk. The beta is also negative, indicating an inverse relationship to the market.

    *   **General Observations:** The inconsistent CAGR and the high MDD point to GRAB's volatile nature and high-risk profile. The trend appears to be improving in recent years, but still indicates underperformance or matching the benchmark.

Potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence and carefully weigh the risks and rewards before investing. Monitor the situation carefully, paying attention to the actual change to Analyst Ratings and any merger updates. Also, compare this stock with other alternatives with a similar upside potential.
