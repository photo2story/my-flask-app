GRAB has shown a mixed performance. While recent revenue and profit margins are positive, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.

However, the cautious hybrid signal and short-term negative divergence indicate potential near-term challenges. The recent news flow suggests investors should closely monitor the company and market developments. While the MRI indicates low risk, the long-term expected return is significantly negative. A very careful and selective investment approach is warranted, focusing on positive trends in revenue, profit margins, and potential for future EPS growth.

In summary, while Grab shows potential for growth, significant risks remain, and investors should proceed with caution.
