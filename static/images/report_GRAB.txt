**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

GRAB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, reflected in the large negative divergence.  The Alpha/Beta analysis shows that while recent CAGR figures have improved, the stock still underperforms relative to its risk (Beta).  The extremely negative expected return is a significant concern.

However, the recent news flow is very positive, focusing on Grab's AI initiatives, Nvidia partnership, and potential for growth. The stock has seen a recent price increase. The hybrid signal is bullish, recommending a high percentage of investment.

The MRI suggests a medium investment risk. Analyst target prices suggest potential upside.

**In summary:** GRAB is a high-risk, high-reward investment.  Its historical performance is poor, but recent developments in AI and partnerships, combined with analyst optimism, could indicate a turnaround.  Investors should carefully weigh the negative expected return against the potential upside from these new initiatives and the recent positive momentum. The stock price surge should be viewed with caution and a long-term investment needs more consideration, as divergence and negative expected return needs to be fixed.
