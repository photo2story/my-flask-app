**Simple Analysis:**

1.  **Return Rate Comparison:**
    *   **Company Overview:** Grab Holdings Ltd is a Southeast Asian technology company providing ride-hailing, food delivery, and digital payment services.
    *   GRAB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). Its cumulative return is negative while the S&P 500 has a strong positive return. The divergence between GRAB and VOO is -57.4, very close to the minimum value of divergence, and the relative divergence is 0.8 (very low). This means GRAB is at the very bottom of its divergence range versus the S&P 500.
    *   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:** The provided table shows a mixed performance. While recent years (2023-2025) show strong CAGR, the older data indicates significant losses. The Beta is 0 or negative meaning it shows almost no movement correlated to the S&P500. Alpha changes between strong negative (-20% to -30%) and roughly zero (0%). The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high.

2.  **Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**
    *   GRAB's recent price has experienced a slight decline, as shown by its 5-day and 20-day SMAs being lower than its previous close. However, it is still significantly below the 60-day SMA, indicating a longer-term downtrend. The "Last-market" data shows a recent small price decrease of -0.97%.

3.  **Index Analysis:**
    *   The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a "High Investment Recommended", contradicting other indicators.
    *   The RSI of 47.67 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
    *   The positive PPO (0.54) indicates a potential upward trend.
    *   The hybrid signal suggests buy 90% of cash based on 0.8 MRI (Safe).
    *   The recent negative change in relative divergence (-5.6) suggests a short-term downward trend.
    *   The expected return is extremely negative (-3613.1%), which is highly unusual and warrants further investigation into the data source.

4.  **News & Significant Events:**
    *   The news highlights mixed sentiments around GRAB.
        *   Some articles focus on GRAB's innovative initiatives like robotaxis and delivery robots.
        *   Other articles question GRAB's valuation and investment potential.

5.  **Analyst Opinions:**

    *   No recent rating changes are provided.

**Comprehensive Analysis:**

Overall, the data paints a mixed picture for GRAB.

*   **Positives:** Analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating with a significant upside potential. The company is exploring innovative technologies. The PPO suggests a potential upward trend.
*   **Negatives:** GRAB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and its historical performance (especially in the 2020-2023 period) is concerning. The extremely negative "Expected Return" is alarming and likely indicates an issue with the data or calculation. Recent news articles show contrasting opinions, with some questioning its investment worthiness. The High Investment Recommendation given the poor past return makes the Market Risk Indicator questionable or inconsistent.

**Conclusion:**

While analysts are optimistic about GRAB's future potential, its past performance and the significant divergence from the S&P 500 raise concerns. The mixed news sentiment and the extraordinarily negative expected return further complicate the investment decision. While the analyst consensus and innovation focus are positives, the potential risks and data inconsistencies should be carefully considered.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this data alone, a cautious approach is warranted. Further due diligence is necessary to understand the reason behind the poor historical performance, the data anomaly with the expected return, and to validate the Market Risk Indicator's recommendation, and analyze company financials, and evaluate the competitive landscape, before making any investment decisions. The high analyst target price suggests potential, but significant risks remain.
