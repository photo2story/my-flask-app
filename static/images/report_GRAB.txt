*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 47.49%

**Table: Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year      | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
| --------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| 2020-2022 | -51.0%   | 73.9% | -26.0%  | 0.0  | 13.1   |
| 2021-2023 | -28.0%   | 73.9% | -29.0%  | 0.0  | 13.7   |
| 2022-2024 | 21.0%    | 73.9% | 0.0%    | 0.0  | 19.2   |
| 2023-2025 | 69.0%    | 70.7% | 6.0%    | -0.1 | 25.1   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** GRAB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period. The -28.5% return discrepancy is substantial. The Relative Discrepancy of 37.6% indicates the underperformance isn't at its historical worst but is still considerable.
*   **Alpha and Beta:** The Alpha and Beta data are interesting.  The consistently negative Alpha (except for the most recent period) indicates GRAB's underperformance relative to its benchmark, even after accounting for market risk. The Beta values close to zero suggest GRAB's price movements are largely independent of the overall market. CAGR은 변동성이 크지만, 최근의 CAGR은 69.0%로 높고, MDD도 줄어들고 있으며, Alpha도 양수로 돌아선 것은 긍정적이다.

*   **RSI:** 50.62 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.83 (Slightly Bearish)

*   **Expected Return:** -54.7% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **RSI Neutrality:** The RSI is around 50, indicating a neutral market sentiment – neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO Bearish Hint:** The negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating slight downward pressure.
*   **Recent Downturn:** The negative change in relative discrepancy over the past 20 days (-8.8) confirms the recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The -54.7% expected return is a significant concern. It implies that, even with long-term dollar-cost averaging, the model predicts GRAB will significantly underperform the S&P 500.
