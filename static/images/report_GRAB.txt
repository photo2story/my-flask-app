**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR figures show significant volatility. Negative CAGR values in the earlier periods (2020-2022, 2021-2023) indicate substantial losses. More recent periods (2022-2024, 2023-2025) show positive growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is consistently high, indicating significant risk and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally negative, meaning that GRAB has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.  The 2022-2024 period shows an alpha of 0.0%, suggesting performance in line with the benchmark during that time.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to 0 suggest that GRAB's price movements have little correlation with the overall market during those periods (or that the model/benchmark used is inappropriate).
*   **Cap (B):** This represents the market capitalization in Billions. The increasing trend suggests a growing company despite performance issues.

*   **5-day SMA:** 4.94
*   **20-day SMA:** 5.14
*   **60-day SMA:** 5.60

**Analysis:**  The current price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, reinforcing this bearish signal.  The recent drop (-1.93%) indicates continued negative momentum.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **RSI:** 23.19 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.25
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-08)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -5.6 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3613.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A medium investment recommendation based on the MRI score suggests that the overall risk in the market is moderate.
*   **RSI:** The low RSI value (23.19) indicates that the stock is currently oversold, potentially suggesting a buying opportunity if a reversal is expected.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO values align with the current downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests deploying 90% of cash to buy 1 share, despite the high MRI, which indicates that the investment is still considered relatively safe.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The decrease in the divergence over the past 20 days confirms recent underperformance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The drastically negative expected return is likely an anomaly or calculation error. Such a large negative return is highly improbable and should be investigated for accuracy.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive News:** Several articles mention potential positive catalysts, including emerging market stock recommendations, and reasons for recent rallies.
*   **Mixed Sentiment:** Other articles question whether GRAB is a buy or hold, and discuss the balance between value and volatility.
*   **Acquisition/Merger Speculation:** There are mentions of potential acquisitions and merger speculation, which can significantly impact stock price.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.50 (Buy)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 28
*   **Target Price (Avg/High/Low):** 6.83 / 8.00 / 5.60

**Analysis:**  Analyst sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, with a Strong Buy consensus and a mean rating indicating a "Buy" recommendation. The average target price of $6.83 suggests significant upside potential from the current price of around $5.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

GRAB's performance has been poor compared to the S&P 500. Historical data shows high volatility (high MDD), and negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to its benchmark. Recent price action confirms a downtrend, with the current price below key moving averages.

However, there are also signals suggesting potential for future improvement. The stock is currently oversold (low RSI), and analyst sentiment is strongly positive, with significant upside potential based on target prices. Recent news indicates potential positive catalysts, including emerging market stock recommendations and acquisition speculation.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The situation is mixed. While the historical and short-term performance is concerning, the oversold condition, strong analyst consensus, and potential positive catalysts warrant a closer look. Investors should carefully weigh the risks (high volatility, past underperformance) against the potential rewards (analyst upside, possible catalysts) before making an investment decision. Further due diligence, including investigation into the cause of the drastically negative expected return, is highly recommended. Furthermore, understanding the reasons behind low beta is also critical. If it is indeed correlated and moves together with the market, this stock may be a reasonable investment.
