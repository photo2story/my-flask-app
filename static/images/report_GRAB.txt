**Analysis:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** GRAB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The large negative divergence indicates substantial relative weakness.
*   **Relative Divergence Interpretation:** The relative divergence of 11.0% suggests that Grab's performance is near the bottom of its historical underperformance range relative to the S&P 500. This means that while it is underperforming, it is nearing its worst historical underperformance levels.
*   **Alpha and Beta:**  The Beta values close to 0 suggest that GRAB's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market.  The negative Alpha values indicate that GRAB has consistently underperformed its expected return based on its risk (Beta). While recent years show positive CAGR, the Alpha remains a concern.
