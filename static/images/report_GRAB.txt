2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided GRAB data, compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison:**

*   **GRAB Overview:** Grab Holdings Ltd is a Southeast Asian technology company that offers ride-hailing, food delivery, and financial services.
*   **GRAB Cumulative Return:** -4.62%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 46.30%
*   **Divergence:** -53.1 (Relative Divergence: 5.7)
*   **Analysis:** GRAB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The -53.1 divergence indicates a substantial difference in returns. The relative divergence of 5.7 suggests that the current divergence is near the lowest point observed in its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -28.0%  | 62.7% | -29.0%  | 1.2  | 13.8   |
| 2022-2024  | 21.0%   | 50.8% | 1.0%    | 1.2  | 19.3   |
| 2023-2025  | 41.0%   | 30.3% | -21.0%  | 1.1  | 20.4   |

*   **CAGR:** Shows the average annual growth rate.  Notice the swing from negative to positive over the periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, indicating risk. These are quite high, showing significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the investment's performance relative to its benchmark index (presumably the S&P 500). Negative alpha suggests underperformance, positive alpha suggests outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. A beta of 1.1-1.2 suggests GRAB is slightly more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in billions of dollars.

**Analysis:** The alpha/beta table reveals that GRAB's performance has been inconsistent. While the CAGR improved in later periods, the maximum drawdowns suggest continued risk.  The beta values indicate GRAB is slightly more volatile than the overall market, which isn't surprising for a growth-oriented tech company.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 5.08
*   **Previous Close:** 4.99
*   **Change:** 1.8%
*   **5-day SMA:** 5.078
*   **20-day SMA:** 5.089
*   **60-day SMA:** 5.4657

**Analysis:** The stock has seen a slight uptick in the last day. The 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are very close, suggesting recent price consolidation. The 60-day SMA being significantly higher indicates a downward trend over the past couple of months.

**3. Technical Indicators and Signals:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 45.19 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.3997 (Neutral)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (176 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80). Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00). Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -574.1%

**Analysis:**
* The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, balancing risk and potential reward.
* The RSI of 45.19 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
* The PPO is also relatively neutral.
* The hybrid signal suggests a high allocation of cash to GRAB stock, with continued monthly investment, deemed "safe" given the MRI, but this seems aggressive based on the very high negative expected return.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days confirms a short-term decline.
* The extremely negative expected return (-574.1%) is a serious red flag, suggesting significant potential losses if held long-term *relative to the S&P 500*. This warrants further investigation into the model used to calculate this figure.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive:** Several articles mention potential reasons to own or consider GRAB, a trending stock, or increased stock holdings by HRT Financial LP.
*   **Negative/Mixed:** An article on Nasdaq suggests investors should "give GRAB stock a miss right now." There's also news about GoTo's potential merger being eyed.
*   **Key Themes:** The news shows mixed sentiment. There's potential interest, but also concerns regarding performance and competition. The GoTo merger item is particularly relevant, as it could significantly impact GRAB's competitive landscape.

**5. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (Mean: 1.50)
*   **Opinions:** 27
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 6.84 / 8.00 / 5.60
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent rating changes provided

**Analysis:** Despite the poor performance and negative expected return, the analyst consensus is "Strong Buy" with a significant target price upside. This could indicate analysts believe in GRAB's long-term potential for growth and market dominance in Southeast Asia.

**6. Comprehensive Analysis:**

GRAB presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:**  Significantly underperforming the S&P 500, high volatility (MDD, Beta), negative expected return, and mixed news sentiment.
*   **Positives:**  Improving CAGR in recent periods, "Strong Buy" analyst consensus with a significant target price upside, and a Market Risk Indicator that leans towards a medium investment.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Reality:**  The strong analyst consensus is a point of divergence from the data. Investors should carefully consider why analysts are so bullish despite the current performance. Are they focusing on long-term potential, ignoring short-term challenges, or perhaps overestimating GRAB's ability to execute its strategy?
*   **Competitive Landscape:**  The potential GoTo merger news is a major factor to watch. Increased competition could negatively impact GRAB's market share and profitability.
*   **Model Assumptions:** The negative expected return needs to be thoroughly understood. What model generated this result, and what assumptions are driving it? If it's accurate, it's a strong reason to avoid GRAB.
*   **Regional Focus:** GRAB's success is heavily tied to the Southeast Asian market. Investors need to be confident in the region's economic growth and GRAB's ability to capitalize on it.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Due to the high volatility, GRAB is only suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.

**In conclusion:** Based on this data alone, investing in GRAB appears risky. The strong analyst consensus provides some counterweight, but the poor performance, negative expected return, and competitive threats warrant extreme caution. Investors should do significant additional research and understand the assumptions behind the models before making any investment decisions.
