**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|--------|

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows mixed performance over different periods. While recent periods show positive growth (21.0% and 40.0%), earlier periods had significant negative growth (-51.0% and -28.0%).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high (around 70-74%), indicating significant potential for capital loss from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally negative, suggesting GRAB has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. The 2022-2024 period shows a 0.0% alpha, indicating performance in line with the benchmark for that period.
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently around -0.0, indicating GRAB's price is relatively insensitive to market movements. This low beta can also indicate that GRAB's performance is influenced by factors specific to the company or its industry rather than broad market trends.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has grown over time, increasing from 13.2B in 2020-2022 to 20.0B in 2023-2025. This suggests that the company's overall size has increased, which can affect its growth potential and stability.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 4.9, Previous Close: 4.98, Change: -1.61%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 5.168
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 5.6625
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 5.7806

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), indicating a short-term downtrend. The recent price change (-1.61%) suggests continued downward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 18.38 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.60
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (163 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Expected Return:** -191.1%

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI of 18.38 indicates that GRAB is currently oversold, which *could* suggest a potential for a price rebound.  However, oversold conditions can persist for extended periods.
*   The negative PPO (-1.60) confirms the downward trend.
*   The negative change in relative divergence (-4.0) over the past 20 days reinforces the short-term bearish outlook.
*   **Important:** The very large negative expected return (-191.1%) is a significant red flag. This suggests models predict significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year period.
*   The Hybrid signal suggests to buy, which seems to contradict other data

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Mentions:**
    *   "4 Underrated Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade" - Inclusion suggests potential long-term value.
    *   "Investors Heavily Search Grab Holdings Limited (GRAB): Here is What You Need to Know" - High search volume indicates investor interest, but the article's content needs to be reviewed to assess sentiment.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (~Buy)
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.50
*   **Number of Opinions:** 28
*   **Target Price:**
    *   **Average:** 6.84
    *   **High:** 8.00
    *   **Low:** 5.60

**Analysis:** Analyst sentiment is strongly positive, with a consensus rating near "Buy" and a significant number of opinions.  The average target price of $6.84 represents a substantial upside from the current price of $4.90. However, the mixed news and technical indicators should be considered in conjunction with analyst opinions.  The lack of recent rating changes suggests a period of stability in analyst views, even after recent events.

**5. Overall Assessment & Recommendation**

GRAB presents a mixed picture.  On one hand, analyst sentiment is positive, and recent news includes some positive developments (partnerships, autonomous vehicle progress, potential long-term value). On the other hand, the stock has significantly underperformed the market, is in a short-term downtrend, and the expected return is alarmingly negative. The Hybrid Signal suggests to buy, which seems to contradict other data. The company may be oversold, but it's important to consider the significant negative return, and take extra caution to invest.

**Recommendation:** Given the contradictory signals and the very high negative expected return, it is advisable to **exercise extreme caution.** If the stock does not show positive growth in the next weeks, it is recommend to sell the stock. The investor should re-evaluate after further positive earnings reports and signs of a turnaround in the stock's performance relative to the broader market.
