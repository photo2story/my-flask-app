**Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** GRAB has significantly underperformed the market (as represented by VOO) during the analyzed periods.
*   **Negative Alpha:**  The consistently negative Alpha indicates that GRAB has not generated excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its market risk (Beta). This means that the investment has underperformed compared to the benchmark index for each period.
*   **Low Beta:** The Beta value is low (close to 0 or slightly negative), indicating that GRAB's price is not very sensitive to market movements. This may be because GRAB operates in a specific geographic market (Southeast Asia) and is influenced by factors different from the broader U.S. stock market. The negative Beta in the most recent period (2023-2025) suggests that the stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the benchmark, although the effect is minimal.
*   **High MDD:** Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is high, indicating the largest percentage drop from a peak to a trough during the specified period. This suggests high volatility and risk.
*   **Improving CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has improved, indicating better performance in more recent periods. This could be due to various factors, such as improvements in the company's business operations, market conditions, or other external factors.
*   **Increasing Market Cap:** The market capitalization of GRAB has increased from 13.2B to 21.6B during the period 2020-2025, suggesting investor confidence and company growth.

The technical indicators suggest positive short-term momentum, but the RSI is nearing overbought levels.
*   **Growth Story vs. Market Performance:** GRAB appears to be a growth story driven by increasing adoption of its services in Southeast Asia. The strong growth, positive earnings surprises, and analyst sentiment suggest potential upside. However, its past underperformance and negative expected return cannot be ignored.
*   **Investment Decision:**
    *   **Aggressive Investors:** Those focused on growth and willing to tolerate higher risk might find GRAB attractive, particularly if they believe in the company's long-term potential in the Southeast Asian market. However, the negative expected return is a serious concern and warrants careful consideration.
    *   **Conservative Investors:** Conservative investors may want to avoid GRAB due to its underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and its volatility. They may prefer to focus on more stable and proven investments.
*   **Important Considerations:** Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and belief in GRAB's long-term growth potential before making any investment decisions. A deeper dive into the factors contributing to the negative expected return is warranted.
