*   **Analyst Opinion:** Strong Buy consensus, but target prices vary.
*   **Earnings:** Recent positive EPS and improving revenue and profit margins are positive signs.
*   **Financials:** Strong revenue growth and profit margins. ROE is improving.

**Conclusion:**

While GRAB exhibits some positive trends in revenue, profitability, and analyst sentiment, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the negative expected return are major concerns. Investors should carefully weigh these factors and conduct further due diligence before considering an investment in GRAB. The recent price decrease and negative change in relative divergence suggest caution in the short term. If the negative long-term expected return is accurate, investors may be better off investing in VOO or other benchmarks.
