**Overall Analysis:**

JD stock has underperformed the market significantly and is currently facing downward price pressure. While the most recent earnings report showed a positive beat, the overall market sentiment appears bearish, as evidenced by the negative PPO and declining relative divergence.

The high expected return is a potential positive factor, but it should be considered within the context of the current bearish trend.
