**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period. While EPS generally beats expectations, revenue growth trends are unclear.

Given the limited data and the underperformance against the S&P 500, coupled with a projected 0% long-term return exceeding the market, further research into recent news, market conditions and a deeper dive into the company's future outlook and prospects is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The oversold condition as indicated by RSI could present a short-term buying opportunity for aggressive investors, but the long-term outlook requires a more thorough analysis considering the considerable historical underperformance.
