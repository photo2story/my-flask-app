**Analysis of the table:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is highly variable, ranging from negative to positive values.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown remains high over the period, indicating high risk.
*   **Alpha:** The alpha values are mostly negative, suggesting that the stock underperformed relative to its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** The beta values are close to zero or negative, indicating a low correlation with the market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movements**

*   **Current Price:** 465.77
*   **Previous Close:** 455.85
*   **Change:** 2.18 (A notable increase from the previous day)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 457.566
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 477.4378
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 479.1282

**Analysis:**  The price is above the 5-day moving average but below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a potential short-term upward trend but may face resistance at the longer-term moving averages.  The 2.18 change is noticeable and could indicate a short-term upward momentum change.

**3. Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 33.87 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -0.548
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Sell 79.6% of holdings (Cash Ratio: 79% on 2025-10-16) Risky - MRI:0.50
*   **20-day Relative Deviation Change:** 3.4 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -224.6% (Significant underperformance compared to S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon)

**Analysis:**  The MRI suggests a medium investment risk. The RSI is nearing oversold, which could signal a potential buying opportunity. The hybrid signal strongly recommends reducing holdings, suggesting caution. The very negative expected return is a major concern. The recent positive change in relative deviation is a potential positive sign.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive:** "LMT Gains 4.6% in the Past 3 Months: Should You Buy The Stock?" (Zacks) - This suggests recent positive momentum, but the "should you buy" question implies uncertainty.
*   **Neutral:** Cubic to Deliver Additional F-35 Air Combat Training Subsystems (ACCESS Newswire) - F-35 related news tends to be key for LMT
*   **General:** Other articles are about related companies (NVIDIA, Micron, Thermo Fisher, TransDigm, Rossell Techsys) and may have indirect implications but aren't directly LMT-specific.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.53)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 526.88 / High: 630.00 / Low: 430.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Hold" with a significant range in target prices. The current price (465.77) is below the average target price, suggesting potential upside according to analysts, but the "Hold" rating tempers this. No recent rating changes were provided

**5. Overall Analysis**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** LMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, reflected in the large negative return difference and negative expected return. The Hybrid Signal is very bearish. The Alpha is generally negative.
*   **Positives:** There's recent positive price momentum.
*   **Neutral/Mixed:** The RSI is approaching oversold. The news is somewhat positive in the short-term. Analyst opinions are "Hold" but suggest some upside potential.

**Conclusion:**

While recent news and a potential oversold RSI might suggest a short-term trading opportunity, the overall picture for LMT appears weak based on the provided data. The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the negative expected return, and the bearish hybrid signal should give potential investors pause. The analyst "Hold" rating reflects this uncertainty. A deeper dive into LMT's fundamentals, industry outlook, and future contracts is warranted before making any investment decisions.
