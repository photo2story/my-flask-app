* **5-Day Moving Average:** $485.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $505.48
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $547.99

The stock is trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The difference between the last market price and the closing price is minimal, indicating a stable price around the close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 22.80 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible, but also increased risk.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.19 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.3 – This short-term upward movement is contrasted by the negative PPO and low RSI.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – This suggests that over a long-term (2+ years) investment, with consistent investment strategy,  the return is likely to align with the S&P 500 with no significant alpha. Given the current market conditions, this needs to be evaluated with caution.  Any significant price increase above $488.13 would require further analysis for reasons behind such a sudden change.

* **EPS:** Fluctuates but largely stable throughout the provided quarters.
* **EPS vs. Expected EPS:**  LMT beat expectations in three out of the five quarters presented, most notably in Q1 2024.  This illustrates a tendency to outperform expectations occasionally, but consistently deliver strong EPS results.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided.  A lack of recent news within the last two days concerning earnings announcements makes it difficult to assess current market sentiment and outlook.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT shows consistent profitability but has underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but the negative PPO and price movement below moving averages indicate a bearish trend.  While earnings have been generally strong and mostly exceeded expectations, recent revenue and ROE figures show some decline, demanding more analysis. The lack of recent news prevents a complete assessment of current market sentiment.  Further investigation is needed to assess the long-term prospects and risks associated with investing in LMT.  The 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 should be viewed cautiously, and may require a reassessment with additional information.
