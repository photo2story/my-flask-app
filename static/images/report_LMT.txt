2025-11-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Lockheed Martin (LMT) based on the provided data:

**1.  Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Lockheed Martin Corp is a global aerospace and defense company engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of technology systems, products, and services.
*   **LMT Cumulative Return:** 26.32%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 94.64%
*   **Divergence:** -68.3 (Relative Divergence: 10.2)

    **Analysis:** LMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. The divergence indicates a considerable difference in cumulative returns, with LMT lagging VOO by a substantial margin. The relative divergence of 10.2 suggests the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range.

    **Alpha, Beta Analysis:** The data shows that Lockheed Martin had a negative Alpha in most periods, indicating a lack of outperformance of the market, including in the most recent 2023-2025 period. Beta values fluctuated, showing a changing sensitivity to market movements. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is high, indicating significant potential for losses.
    *   The fluctuating CAGR shows inconsistent growth over different 3-year periods.
    *   The negative Alpha values in most periods suggest that LMT underperformed relative to what would be expected given its beta and the market's performance.
    *   The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates significant risk or volatility.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 460.78
*   **Previous Close:** 468.26
*   **Change:** -1.6%
*   **5-day SMA:** 468.89
*   **20-day SMA:** 471.86
*   **60-day SMA:** 480.54

    **Analysis:** LMT's current price is below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The recent price decline (-1.6% change) further reinforces this observation.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 31.85 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.0366
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (3 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** 1.0 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -195.5%

    **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a moderate level of risk and recommends medium investment.
    *   The RSI value of 31.85 indicates that the stock is nearing oversold conditions, which could potentially signal a buying opportunity if confirmed by other indicators.
    *   The Positive PPO (Price Percentage Oscillator) suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which typically indicates upward momentum.
    *   The Hybrid Signal suggests a strong buy signal based on the current data, recommending the purchase of 3 shares with 90% of available cash, while maintaining a 0% cash position. This implies a bullish outlook from the hybrid strategy despite other concerning metrics.
    *   The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a potential short-term upward trend.
    *   The extremely negative expected return (-195.5%) is concerning. This suggests the model projects significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if invested long-term from this point, or that there is an error with the inputs.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Several news headlines point to negative sentiment surrounding LMT. Examples include the "Day 6 of Loss Streak," "Lockheed Martin Stock Falling Despite Positive Earnings", and "Rhumbline Advisers Cuts Position."
*   **Analyst Discussions:** News regarding analyst forecasts ("Lockheed Martin Stock Prediction: Where Analysts See the Stock Going by 2027") and general analysis ("(LMT) Equity Market Report (LMT:CA)") are present.
*   **Investor Attention:** One headline notes that Lockheed Martin is attracting investor attention, but the context likely leans towards observing the recent performance.

    **Analysis:** The recent news flow is predominantly negative, highlighting price declines, institutional selling, and concerns despite positive earnings. This negativity likely contributes to downward pressure on the stock.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.50)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 528.17 / 630.00 / 430.00

    **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is Hold, suggesting a neutral outlook on the stock. The average target price of $528.17 implies potential upside from the current price, but there's a wide range in target prices, reflecting uncertainty among analysts. The absence of recent rating changes indicates no significant shifts in analyst sentiment.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis Summary**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) is currently facing headwinds. It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting negative Alpha and a high Maximum Drawdown over various periods. Recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, with the price trading below key moving averages. Recent news is largely negative, focusing on price declines and institutional selling.

The RSI is nearing oversold, which could present a buying opportunity. The MRI suggests medium investment. The hybrid signal gives a strong buy recommendation for a relatively small amount, which contradicts other negative metrics.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the current analysis, a cautious approach to investing in LMT is warranted. While the RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, the overall negative trends, underperformance relative to the market, and predominantly negative news flow raise concerns. More data and positive catalysts would be needed to justify a strong buy recommendation.
