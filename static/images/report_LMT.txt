**6. Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin shows mixed signals.  While it has exceeded earnings expectations and possesses a strong market position, its significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the volatile alpha and beta, highly fluctuating profit margins and ROE,  and the negative long-term expected return raise serious concerns.  The recent price jump requires investigation into the underlying causes.  Before recommending any long-term investment, a deeper dive into the company's strategic initiatives, competitive landscape, and potential future growth drivers is necessary to assess the validity of the -75.7% expected return and fully understand the long-term investment potential.  The high risk indicator further underscores the need for caution.
