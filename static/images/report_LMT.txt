**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR Trends:** CAGR(연평균 복합 성장률) has fluctuated significantly, showing strong growth in earlier periods (e.g., 2015-2017) but declining and even turning negative in more recent periods (e.g., 2018-2020, 2020-2022, 2023-2025).
*   **MDD:** MDD(최대 낙폭) values are quite high, consistently above 60%, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha values have been predominantly negative, particularly in recent periods, suggesting underperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). A negative alpha means that the investment has not performed as well as expected, given the risk it has taken.
*   **Beta:** Beta values have decreased over time, ranging from 0.8 to 0.2. A beta of less than 1 indicates that LMT is less volatile than the market. The decrease in beta suggests that LMT has become less correlated with the overall market in recent years.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally increased over the years, indicating growth in the company’s size, though this does not necessarily correlate with higher returns or better performance metrics.

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day and 20-day moving averages are close to the current price, while the 60-day moving average is significantly lower. This suggests a potential short-term upward trend but could also indicate consolidation.
