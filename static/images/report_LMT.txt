**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*This section requires additional information.  The prompt did not include any recent news or analyst opinions.*


**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT has underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. While technical indicators (RSI) suggest potential for a rebound, the negative expected return and recent price movement below moving averages paint a cautious picture.  Earnings have been relatively stable but don't show a strong, consistent growth trend.  Financial data shows some short-term fluctuation.  More information is needed on recent news and analyst sentiment to provide a complete assessment.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the underperformance relative to the market, the negative long-term expected return, and the lack of clear upward momentum in recent earnings and price action, a cautious approach is warranted.  Further research into the company's strategic initiatives, competitive landscape, and any significant upcoming news is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The oversold RSI suggests the potential for a short-term rebound; however, a long-term perspective should consider the consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.  The absence of recent news and analyst data significantly limits the scope of this analysis.
