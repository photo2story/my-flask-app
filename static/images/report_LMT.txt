Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  While LMT has shown positive growth in certain periods, its recent performance lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO).  Short-term price movements suggest some volatility, and financial statements reveal fluctuations in profitability and capital.  Further investigation is needed to determine long-term investment viability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT's performance has been inconsistent, underperforming the S&P 500 significantly in the long-term. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, profit margins and ROE fluctuate considerably. Short-term price movements show some volatility.  The extremely negative long-term expected return (-79.4%) requires further scrutiny. A thorough review of the calculation methodology is crucial before drawing any conclusions based on this figure.  Given the data provided, the investment decision requires careful consideration of risk tolerance and a more in-depth analysis of the company's future prospects and the market outlook.  Additional qualitative factors (e.g., geopolitical events, defense spending) should also be considered.
