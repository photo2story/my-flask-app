**7. Overall Summary and Conclusion**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly, with a large cumulative return deviation. While the company consistently beats EPS estimates, the high maximum drawdowns and negative alpha in historical data suggest higher relative risk. Recent news indicates increased volatility and analyst scrutiny. The recent earnings beats and generally stable revenues are positive, but the significant underperformance and negative expected return need to be carefully considered. The low MRI suggests the stock is not fundamentally risky, but the potential for continued underperformance relative to the market benchmark is a major concern. The company's financial information reveals fluctuating profit margins and equity, with a recent recovery in profitability and ROE after a dip in Q4 2024.
