**6. Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin has shown inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500. While it has delivered positive returns, it has significantly underperformed the market benchmark.  Recent price action suggests a slight downward trend.  The company's earnings have generally exceeded expectations, but profitability metrics show some recent volatility. The high beta indicates higher-than-market volatility. The significantly negative expected return (-69.7%) raises serious concerns about future performance.  A deeper dive into the assumptions underpinning this expected return, coupled with a thorough examination of the macroeconomic factors affecting the defense industry, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis, including consideration of qualitative factors (e.g., government contracts, competition, technological advancements) is needed for a complete investment assessment.  The -1.21 change in the last market day is a relatively minor decrease and doesn't signify a significant event on its own.
