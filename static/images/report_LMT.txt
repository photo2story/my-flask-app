**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT has shown strong earnings performance, consistently beating expectations. However, its stock price performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly, resulting in a negative expected return. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with RSI suggesting a neutral position, while PPO shows bullish momentum.  The recent price movement is slightly negative but not alarming. The significant drop in profit margin in Q4 2024 is a concern.  Further investigation into the reasons behind this drop and a more in-depth analysis of the company's long-term growth prospects are needed before making any investment decisions.  The high Beta suggests higher risk compared to the overall market.  A long-term investment strategy should consider this risk profile and potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
