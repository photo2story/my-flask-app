**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Lockheed Martin demonstrates consistent earnings beats and generally strong financial fundamentals.  However, its significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-40.4 percentage points), coupled with a projected negative long-term expected return of -67.5%, raises concerns.  While the company's core business is relatively stable and benefits from consistent government spending, investors should carefully weigh the current underperformance and the market's overall valuation of the stock against its potential long-term growth.  The relatively high beta also suggests increased risk compared to the broader market.  A long-term investment strategy should be carefully considered in light of this analysis.
