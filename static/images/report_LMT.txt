**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT shows strong earnings beats but exhibits significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly over the longer term (as indicated by the expected return of -12%). While recent price action shows some short-term positive momentum, the stock remains below its longer-term moving averages.  Financial data shows some volatility in profitability, with a significant drop in profit margins in the most recent quarter.  Further investigation into the drivers of this variance, alongside a deeper analysis of the long-term growth prospects, is necessary to fully assess the investment potential.  The consistently positive EPS beats suggest underlying strength in the company's core business, yet the market's valuation may not reflect these positive fundamentals at present.  A long-term investor might consider LMT, but careful monitoring and further due diligence are essential.
