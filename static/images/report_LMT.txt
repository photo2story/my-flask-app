**Analysis:** The news is mixed. The drop today, combined with the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, is negative. The family office purchase and analyst coverage provide some contrasting views, suggesting that there might be some confidence in the long-term prospects.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Neutral (represented by "-")
*   **Target Price:** Average: 528.17, High: 630.00, Low: 430.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is neutral. The average target price of $528.17 is above the current price, suggesting potential upside if analysts' expectations are met. However, the low target price is below the current price which may be cause for concern.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) is currently facing several challenges. While the company operates in a relatively stable sector (defense), its stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500. The negative divergence, along with recent negative Alpha values, highlights this underperformance.

Technically, the stock is in a short-term downtrend, with the price below key moving averages. The low expected return compared to the S&P 500 should be noted. Recent news is mixed, with a price drop, contrasted by a family office purchase. Analyst opinion is neutral with an average target price above current levels.

**In summary, based on the data provided, investing in LMT at this point appears risky due to the very low expected return. Further research and due diligence are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.**
