## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Analysis

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Lockheed Martin's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500. LMT's return is 78.16% while VOO's return is 120.85%, a difference of -42.68%.  The relative divergence of 19.5 indicates that LMT's performance is in the lower range compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Company Overview:** Lockheed Martin Corp is a global security and aerospace company primarily engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, and integration of advanced technology systems, products, and services.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance against the S&P 500. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others, particularly recent years, show significant negative alpha. The consistently low beta (0.1) indicates low correlation with the market, suggesting LMT's stock price is less sensitive to overall market fluctuations.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

LMT's current price ($487.83) is below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a recent downtrend. The price is slightly below the last closing price ($490.61).  The declining moving averages suggest weakening momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (22.56):**  Significantly oversold, suggesting the stock might be undervalued and potentially poised for a rebound, although this is not guaranteed.
* **PPO (-0.3185):** Negative PPO indicates weakening momentum and confirms the downtrend observed in the moving averages.
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (-8.6):** Further confirms the short-term downward trend against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The projected long-term return is neutral relative to the S&P 500, suggesting no expected outperformance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

LMT has consistently beaten EPS estimates in the last five quarters. EPS has fluctuated but generally remained strong.  Without revenue data, it's impossible to analyze revenue growth trends. However, the consistent EPS beats suggest positive performance, though further analysis is needed to confirm this.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuated over the past five quarters, with a notable dip in Q1 2024 followed by a slight recovery. The most recent quarter shows a decrease in revenue compared to the same quarter of the previous year.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have remained relatively stable, ranging between 11.59% and 12.38% over the five quarters.
* **Equity:** Equity has also fluctuated, with a significant drop in Q2 2024 but recovering in the most recent quarter.  However, it remains below the level of Q3 2023.
* **ROE:**  ROE has been volatile, reaching a high of 27.30% in Q4 2023 but dropping significantly in Q3 2024. This volatility warrants further investigation into the underlying drivers.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

Information about recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is missing and would be crucial for a comprehensive analysis.  Knowing the context behind recent price movements and the company's future outlook is essential for investment decisions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT shows mixed signals. While earnings have consistently beat expectations, the stock price is currently in a downtrend. Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, hinting at a potential rebound. However, the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is neutral, and the company's revenue and ROE have shown volatility.  Further investigation into recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is crucial to form a complete investment thesis. The underperformance against the S&P 500 over the analyzed period is a significant concern.
