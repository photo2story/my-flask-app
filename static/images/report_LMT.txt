## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  Over the review period, LMT's cumulative return (77.43%) lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%) by 40.9 percentage points.  This places LMT at the 21.4th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on a range of -62.3% to 37.8%.  While LMT has shown positive growth, it has underperformed the broader market significantly during this period. The provided CAGR data shows inconsistent year-over-year performance, highlighting periods of both strong growth and underperformance.  The alpha consistently shows near zero, indicating that the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements (Beta is also high, indicating higher volatility along with market).

The closing price is above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downtrend.  The recent price increase of $0.71 from the previous close might be considered a minor upward movement, not a significant "sharp rebound".

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin demonstrates consistent profitability and strong earnings beats. However, its stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 considerably, and long-term projections suggest continued underperformance.  While the company's financials are generally healthy, the recent decline in revenue, profit margins, equity and ROE raises concerns.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind these declines. The relatively high Beta suggests that the stock's price is highly sensitive to market fluctuations.  Investors should carefully consider this risk.  A long-term investor might consider LMT if they are willing to accept the risk of underperformance relative to the market, but this should be part of a diversified portfolio.
