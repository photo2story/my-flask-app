*   **Positives:** LMT has consistently beaten EPS expectations in recent quarters, and its revenue has been relatively stable.  The MRI indicates low market risk, although the hybrid signal tempers this with a recommendation for caution.
*   **Neutral:** The recent price movement is slightly positive, but needs to be considered in the context of longer-term trends. Recent news suggests the company is undergoing significant changes.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the negative expected return, a **cautious** approach to LMT is warranted. Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and the factors driving the negative expected return is highly recommended. Monitoring upcoming news and company announcements will be crucial. While the company has strong earnings and stable revenue, these factors are overshadowed by the negative performance metrics relative to the broader market.
