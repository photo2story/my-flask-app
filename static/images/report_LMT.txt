## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), LMT's cumulative return lags significantly.  While VOO achieved a 112.74% cumulative return, LMT showed a 75.31% return, resulting in a difference of -37.4%.  This places its relative performance at the 24.9th percentile based on historical volatility. The provided alpha values consistently show a near-zero correlation with the market (beta). This suggests that LMT's performance has been largely independent of broad market movements.  However, its CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows considerable variability across the different periods, reflecting the cyclical nature of the defense industry.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $484.46
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $473.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $482.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $521.83

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The distance between the current price and the 60-day moving average is notable, hinting at a more significant pullback.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 46.15 –  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning towards the lower end of the neutral range.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.35 – A positive value indicates bullish momentum, but relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +11.6 – Suggests a short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -6.0% – This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) underperformance compared to the S&P 500, assuming a consistent investment strategy.  Given the current price is close to the 20-day MA, it doesn't suggest immediate sharp movements (up or down).

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains strong. Profit margins are consistently high and relatively stable, hovering around 12%.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some volatility. ROE (Return on Equity) is exceptionally high, indicating efficient use of capital and strong profitability.  However, there's considerable quarter-to-quarter variation.


**7. Overall Summary:**

LMT displays strong profitability and consistent earnings beats. However, its stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 over the considered period.  The relatively low RSI and the negative projected return against the S&P 500 suggest a cautious outlook for the short-to-medium term.  Long-term investors might consider the company's strong fundamentals and consistent earnings, but the projected underperformance compared to the market needs careful consideration. The price is currently consolidating, and further observation of price action relative to its moving averages is advisable before taking any position.  The high ROE suggests strong internal value creation, but external market factors may be currently influencing its performance relative to the broader market.
