**5. Comprehensive Analysis & Summary**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) presents a mixed picture. While a leading company in its sector, the data suggests significant concerns:

*   **Underperformance:** LMT has substantially underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Alpha:** LMT has struggled to deliver returns above what would be expected for its level of risk.
*   **Volatility:** High MDD values indicate the stock is prone to significant price swings.
*   **Overbought:** The RSI indicates the stock may be overbought in the short term.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The very negative expected return suggests further underperformance is anticipated.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** While analysts have a "Hold" consensus, a recent downgrade and institutional selling raise red flags.

**Recommendation:** Given the underperformance relative to the S&P500, frequent negative alpha, and the negative expected return, caution is advised. The "Hold" consensus is tempered by the downgrade news and the high RSI (overbought signal). Consider the high MDD and recent negative price action. A potential investor should closely scrutinize the company's earnings reports, backlog, and future growth prospects before considering an investment in LMT.
