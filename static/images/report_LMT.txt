### 7. Overall Analysis

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) shows a mixed picture. While the company consistently beats EPS estimates and maintains strong revenue and ROE, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The high historical Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial risk, while recent market risk indicators suggest lower risk. The negative expected return is a major red flag, warranting careful consideration and further investigation. Recent news indicates potential volatility.

**In summary:**

*   **Strengths:** Strong earnings performance, consistent revenue, high ROE (except Q4 2024).
*   **Weaknesses:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high historical volatility, a very negative expected return.
*   **Opportunities:** Potential for growth driven by business developments, regulatory changes, and market events.
*   **Threats:** Volatility driven by news and market sentiment, potential challenges impacting future profitability (as indicated by the expected return).

**Recommendation:**  Given the significant underperformance, high historical volatility, and alarmingly negative expected return, a cautious approach is warranted. Further research is needed to understand the drivers behind the negative expected return and the potential for LMT to improve its relative performance. Monitoring news and company announcements is crucial.
