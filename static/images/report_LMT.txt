* **Q1 2024:** A notable increase compared to Q4 2023 and Q1 2023.

However, the data only shows EPS. Without revenue data explicitly linked to these quarters, it is impossible to assess revenue growth trends fully.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to be completed.  This data was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT shows mixed signals. While it boasts strong profitability and consistent EPS beats, its underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is concerning.  The negative long-term expected return, coupled with the current price being below key moving averages, suggests caution. The oversold RSI hints at a potential short-term rebound, but the long-term outlook appears less promising based on the available data. Further analysis incorporating missing data (news, analyst opinions, revenue growth trends fully correlated with EPS) is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
