**7. Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin demonstrates consistent earnings beats, suggesting strong operational performance. However, its stock price significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, resulting in a negative long-term expected return relative to the market. While the recent short-term price action shows some upward momentum,  the negative expected return and its position below its 60-day moving average raise concerns.  A more in-depth analysis of the company's strategic direction, future growth prospects, and valuation is necessary to determine whether the current price represents a good investment opportunity.  The relatively high ROE suggests profitability but needs more context within industry benchmarks.  Investors should consider these factors before making any investment decisions.  The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is a major red flag.
