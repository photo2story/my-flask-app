This report analyzes Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) stock performance based on the provided data.  The analysis covers performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, technical indicators, financial performance, and recent news.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company that designs, develops, manufactures, integrates, and sustains advanced technology systems, products, and services.

The cumulative return for LMT is 105.02%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 123.86%.  This represents a current lag of -18.84% for LMT compared to VOO.

While LMT has underperformed VOO, it's important to note that this is relative to the historical range and does not necessarily predict future underperformance. The provided CAGR data shows varying performance over different time periods, ranging from 20.3% to 80.5%, indicating fluctuating growth. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values suggest periods of significant price drops, with the highest reaching 36%. Alpha and Beta values indicate varying degrees of market sensitivity and outperformance, suggesting a degree of independence from broad market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $534.83 (Last Market: $534.97)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $553.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $557.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $574.23

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the last market price suggests limited recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.53 - This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, RSI should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.19 - A negative PPO value confirms the bearish short-term trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -28.66% - This significant negative change reinforces the short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% - This indicates that the expected long-term (2+ years) return relative to the S&P 500 is neutral at the current valuation.  Further analysis is needed to support this claim.  It's worth noting that a 0.0% expected return doesn't imply a poor investment.  The risk-adjusted return should also be considered.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture. While EPS has generally exceeded expectations, there's a slight downward trend in recent quarters. The most recent quarter (2024-10-22) showed EPS slightly exceeding expectations (6.8 vs 6.5).  More detailed analysis, including revenue growth and profit margin trends, is needed to determine the overall earnings momentum and future prospects.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals relatively consistent profitability with revenue in the range of $16.88B to $18.87B over the past year.  Profit margins have fluctuated between 11.59% and 12.38%, with ROE (Return on Equity) ranging from 18.16% to 27.30%.  This indicates generally healthy financial performance, but a deeper dive is recommended to assess the sustainability of these metrics.  A decline in equity in Q2 2024 is worth investigating further.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **(Missing Data):** The request for news within the last two days requires access to real-time news sources.  Providing specific news articles (from Shacknews, FINBOLD, etc.) and analyst opinions would allow for a more comprehensive analysis of recent market sentiment and performance highlights.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary of 1-6):**

LMT has demonstrated varying performance relative to the S&P 500. While it has shown periods of strong growth,  it currently lags the S&P 500. Short-term technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  However, the stock is showing signs of being oversold (RSI), with the possibility of a bounce.  Long-term projections necessitate a more in-depth analysis of the financial statements and market outlook.   The recent earnings have been mostly positive but show some slowing momentum.  To complete a thorough analysis, recent news and analyst opinions are essential.
