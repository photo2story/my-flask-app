The final cumulative return difference between LMT and VOO is -27.1%.  This places LMT at the 33rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent closing price of 528.1 is close to the 5-day moving average, indicating a period of consolidation or potential near-term support.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (29.48):**  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.16):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (nan):**  The provided data is missing, hindering a complete assessment of recent relative strength changes. The '-' designation indicates a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% is likely relative to the market (S&P 500). This suggests that long-term investment (2+ years) in LMT is not expected to significantly outperform the S&P 500.  Given the oversold RSI, a potential short-term rebound could be expected.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin's EPS has been generally consistent, but with some fluctuation.  There have been a few instances of exceeding expectations (EPS beats):

* **2024-10-22:** EPS of 6.8 exceeded the expected 6.5.
* **2024-07-23:** EPS of 6.85 exceeded the expected 6.46.
* **2024-04-23:** EPS of 6.39 exceeded the expected 5.82.
* **2024-01-23:** EPS of 7.88 exceeded the expected 7.26.

While there has been some quarter-to-quarter variability, the company has generally demonstrated a positive trend in EPS, exceeding expectations on several occasions.  Further analysis of revenue trends would be needed for a fuller picture.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue shows some fluctuation, without a clear upward or downward trend over the reported period.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins remain relatively stable around 12%, indicating consistent profitability.  A slight dip occurred in Q2 2024.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This data was not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT is currently trading below its moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.  However, the RSI suggests the stock is oversold, which could indicate a potential short-term rebound.  While the company shows consistent profitability and has exceeded earnings expectations several times recently, its long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is projected to be insignificant.  The considerable fluctuations in equity and ROE require more investigation.  A complete analysis requires missing data points such as recent news, market outlook, and revenue trends.  The relatively high Beta value indicates that the stock's performance is strongly correlated with the broader market.

**8. Recommendations:**

Further research is needed to definitively assess LMT's prospects. The information provided points to a relatively stable but not exceptionally high-growth stock.  Consider supplementing this analysis with additional information, including news, analyst reports, and a more detailed examination of revenue trends to make a fully informed investment decision. The current situation presents both risks (potential for further declines) and opportunities (potential short-term bounce from oversold conditions). Long-term investors should weigh this risk-reward against their overall portfolio strategy.
