**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (2.57)
*   **Price Target (avg/high/low):** 521.32 / 590.00 / 430.00

The consensus hold rating and the target price range indicate that analysts are neutral on LMT's prospects.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly. Its recent cumulative return is far below that of the index, and the divergence is substantial. The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistent underperformance relative to the market. While the stock is trading above its 20-day moving average, recent news paints a mixed picture. The Morgan Stanley downgrade, the reduction in holdings by Ipswich Investment Management, and the end of a winning streak raise concerns.

The most concerning indicator is the *extremely* negative Expected Return (-200.7%), suggesting the model predicts continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. The analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting that analysts are waiting to see how the company performs before making a stronger recommendation.

The data suggests caution regarding investment in LMT at this time. The company needs to address growth concerns and demonstrate an ability to generate market-beating returns. The negative expected return and recent negative news outweigh the somewhat positive technical indicators.
