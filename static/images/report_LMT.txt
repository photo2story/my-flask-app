* **20-Day Moving Average:** $463.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $487.66

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price change (-2.65) indicates a short-term decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 12.6 – This extremely low RSI suggests the stock is significantly oversold.
* **PPO:** -0.61 – A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -4.1 – This confirms the short-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return:** -210.6% – This extremely negative expected return is concerning and needs further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While recent earnings have generally beaten expectations, the substantial drop in profit margins and ROE in Q4 2024 raises serious concerns. Technical indicators point to an oversold condition, but the extremely negative expected return and current downtrend necessitate caution.  The -210.6% expected return requires further clarification regarding the methodology used to arrive at this figure. A thorough examination of the company's financial statements, future projections, and industry trends is crucial before making any investment decisions. The significant discrepancies in financial metrics warrant a deeper dive into the company's disclosures and future outlook to ascertain the reasons for this underperformance and the validity of the extremely negative expected return.
