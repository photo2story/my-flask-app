**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT's recent performance has been underwhelming compared to the S&P 500.

The -77.9% expected return needs further explanation.  The high beta suggests high market sensitivity.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons behind the recent price drop and the volatility in profit margins and ROE before forming any investment decisions.  A thorough review of macroeconomic factors affecting the defense industry is also recommended.
