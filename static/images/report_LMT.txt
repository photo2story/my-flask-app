The negative recent relative divergence change (-10%) suggests a short-term bearish trend.

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided.  A complete financial analysis cannot be performed without this crucial information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is notable, despite positive earnings surprises.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity. While recent price action shows some positive momentum, the negative relative divergence and relatively neutral RSI suggest caution.  The lack of revenue and gross profit data limits a comprehensive evaluation of the company's financial health.  The projected long-term underperformance against the S&P 500 (-79.4%) is a significant concern.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the underperformance and a thorough review of complete financial statements are necessary before forming a conclusive investment opinion.
