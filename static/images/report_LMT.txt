**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Company Overview:** Lockheed Martin Corp. is a global aerospace, defense, security, and advanced technologies company.
*   **Cumulative Return (LMT):** 30.70%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -68.3 (Relative Divergence: 10.4)

**Analysis:** LMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period. The divergence of -68.3 indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 10.4 suggests that the current level of divergence is near the minimum levels that the divergence has displayed in the past (minimum -79.2).

The Alpha/Beta table shows inconsistent performance. In some periods (e.g., 2015-2017), LMT had strong CAGR and positive Alpha. However, in other periods (e.g., 2018-2020, 2020-2022), it experienced negative CAGR and negative Alpha, implying that it has performed worse than expected for its risk. The Beta values fluctuate, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.

*   **Current Price:** 474.13
*   **5-day SMA:** 476.11

*   **60-day SMA:** 478.53

**Analysis:** The current price is below both the 5-day and 60-day SMA, but above the 20-day SMA. This suggests a mixed short-term trend. The fact that the 20-day SMA is below the current price indicates a short term uptrend.

*   **Divergence Change:** 3.8 (Positive)
*   **Expected Return:** -200.7%

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. However, the RSI indicates that LMT might be overbought, which often precedes a price correction. The positive PPO suggests bullish momentum in the short term, but the highly negative expected return is a major concern for long-term investors.

*   **Mixed:** An article questioned whether LMT shares would rebound.

**Analysis:** The news is a mix of positive and negative. The downgrade by J.P. Morgan and concerns about cash flow are significant negatives. The new contract and backlog momentum provide some positive counterpoints. The "Will Lockheed Martin rebound?" headline reflects uncertainty in the market.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (2.57)
*   **Target Price:** 523.95 (Average)

**Analysis:** The Hold rating suggests that analysts are not overwhelmingly positive or negative about LMT's prospects. The average target price of $523.95 is above the current price, implying potential upside.
