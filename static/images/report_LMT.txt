Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins have fluctuated considerably.  Equity and ROE have also seen significant volatility.  Year-over-year changes highlight negative trends in recent quarters.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin's recent performance lags behind the S&P 500. While the company has exceeded EPS expectations,  concerns arise from the negative trend in profit margins and ROE, coupled with a relatively high beta suggesting market sensitivity.  The extremely negative projected return (-57.4%) requires further clarification.  The short-term price movement suggests bearish pressure, but the positive PPO and recent relative divergence suggest potential for recovery.  A deeper dive into the factors driving the recent decline in profit margins and ROE is crucial for a complete assessment of LMT's long-term prospects.  A comprehensive analysis should consider macroeconomic factors impacting the defense industry and LMT's specific competitive landscape.  The -57.4% expected return needs additional context and should not be taken at face value.
