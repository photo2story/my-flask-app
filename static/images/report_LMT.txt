**5. Comprehensive Analysis Summary:**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with negative alpha and substantial MDD. Recent news reflects mixed sentiment, with analyst price targets ranging widely and concerns raised about profitability. The technical indicators present a mixed picture: a slight recent price increase, a neutral RSI, but a negative divergence change and a drastically negative expected return.

**Overall, the analysis suggests caution.** While the MRI indicates a medium investment recommendation, the negative expected return, mixed analyst opinions, and concerns about profitability warrant a careful and conservative approach. The stock is trading around its 60-day SMA, so monitoring this level will be crucial. The recent analyst target of $505 is above the current price, but the wide range of analyst targets reflects uncertainty. Further research and careful consideration of risk tolerance are necessary before making any investment decisions. The underperformance relative to the broader market is a major red flag.
