| 2019-2021  | 7.0% | 63.2% | -47.0% | 0.6 | 76.5 |

The data shows fluctuating performance and risk (MDD - Maximum Drawdown), and a beta consistently less than 1, suggesting lower volatility than the overall market (although this is not always indicative of future performance).  Alpha values are mixed, indicating periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $475.34
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $463.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $451.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $454.86

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend in the short term.  The recent price increase of $0.09 from the previous close is relatively minor and doesn't indicate a significant upward or downward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 68.79 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.78 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.9% (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -65.7% (Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term based on provided data).

The high MRI, relatively high RSI, and negative relative divergence suggest caution. While the PPO is positive, the overall picture indicates a potentially risky investment with a projected substantial underperformance relative to the market benchmark over the long term (2+ years).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 7.67    | 6.62         | 1.05       |
| 2024-10-22 | 6.80    | 6.50         | 0.30       |
| 2024-07-23 | 6.85    | 6.46         | 0.39       |
| 2024-04-23 | 6.39    | 5.82         | 0.57       |
| 2024-01-23 | 7.88    | 7.26         | 0.62       |

LMT has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters.  This positive trend suggests strong underlying performance, although the overall stock performance has lagged the market, creating a disconnect between fundamental strength and market valuation.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.62B   | 3.71%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.10B   | 12.38%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $18.12B   | 11.75%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $17.20B   | 11.59%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $18.87B   | 12.16%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE          |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $6.33B    | 8.32%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.20B    | 22.54%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.17B    | 26.57%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.65B    | 23.23%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.83B    | 27.30%       |

Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins show considerable fluctuation.  ROE also fluctuates, indicating variability in the efficiency of capital utilization.  The December 2024 quarter shows a significant drop in both profit margin and ROE, warranting further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT shows strong fundamental performance with consistent earnings beats, but its stock price has substantially underperformed the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially overbought market with short-term downward pressure. The projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-65.7%) is a significant concern. Further investigation is needed to understand the discrepancy between the company's strong fundamentals and its lagging stock performance. The significant drop in profit margin and ROE in the last quarter needs to be addressed to provide a more complete analysis.  Investors should proceed with caution and carefully consider the risks before investing in LMT.
