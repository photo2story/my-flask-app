**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.62B    | 3.71%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.10B    | 12.38%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $18.87B    | 12.16%        |

Profit margins show some volatility.  The significant drop in profit margin in Q4 2024 requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  Revenue remains relatively stable, fluctuating around $17-19 billion.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $6.33      | 8.32    |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.20      | 22.54   |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.17      | 26.57   |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.65      | 23.23   |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.83      | 27.30   |

ROE shows significant fluctuation, potentially due to changes in net income and equity.  The drop in both ROE and Equity in Q4 2024 requires deeper analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin shows a mixed performance. While consistently beating earnings expectations and maintaining relatively stable revenue, the significant underperformance against the S&P 500, bearish short-term technical indicators (moving averages, PPO, relative divergence), and volatility in profit margins and ROE warrant caution. The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term adds to this concern.  Further investigation into the reasons for the Q4 2024 financial performance downturn is crucial before making any investment decisions.  While the company has a history of strong performance,  investors should carefully consider the current market conditions and the company's recent financial performance before investing.
