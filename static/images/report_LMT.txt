## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  While its cumulative return (61.06%) lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) (112.87%) over the observed period,  its recent earnings and financial performance show some strength despite market volatility.  Further analysis reveals mixed signals regarding its future performance.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500:**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly. The cumulative return difference is -51.8%, placing it at the 16.3rd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests that while LMT has generated positive returns, it has not kept pace with the broader market's growth.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others demonstrate negative alpha, suggesting inconsistent market-beating performance.  The beta consistently hovers around 0.3 - 1, indicating a lower level of volatility than the overall market. Capitalization (Cap) is fluctuating, indicating business growth and potential market sensitivity.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 45.0% | 2.5% | 16.0% | 0.0 | 62.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 4.0% | 14.0% | -14.0% | 0.1 | 52.6 |
| 2017-2019  | 39.0% | 14.0% | 9.0% | 0.8 | 80.2 |
| 2018-2020  | -18.0% | 14.0% | -45.0% | 0.4 | 75.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 16.0% | 12.5% | -55.0% | 0.3 | 77.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 11.0% | 12.5% | 2.0% | 0.3 | 108.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 42.0% | 8.3% | 18.0% | 0.3 | 104.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 26.0% | 8.3% | -7.0% | 0.3 | 114.4 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $446.46
* **5-day Moving Average:** $443.48
* **20-day Moving Average:** $444.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** $475.81

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates recent price consolidation.  However, the significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average points to a more substantial decline from recent highs.  The price increased slightly (1.12%) compared to the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.6 – Near neutral territory, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.51 – Positive value indicates upward momentum, but relatively low magnitude.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):**  +12.1% - indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -10.3% –  This suggests underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This forecast should be treated with caution as it relies on numerous assumptions.

The 1.12% daily price increase is not significant enough to classify as a rapid upswing.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 예상 EPS | Difference |

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.62B   | 3.71%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.10B   | 12.38%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $18.12B   | 11.75%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $17.20B   | 11.59%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $18.87B   | 12.16%        |

Revenue fluctuates but remains relatively stable.  Profit margins show some variability, with a notable drop in Q4 2024. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind this fluctuation.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $6.33      | 8.32    |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.20      | 22.54   |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.17      | 26.57   |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.65      | 23.23   |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.83      | 27.30   |

Equity shows some variability, and ROE is highly variable across quarters.  This suggests potential sensitivity to market conditions and/or significant changes in operational efficiency.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT's consistent earnings beat and relatively strong financial position (despite fluctuating profitability metrics) are positive factors. However, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, current price position below its moving averages, and the projected long-term underperformance relative to the market raise concerns.  Further investigation into the reasons for the Q4 2024 profit margin decline and the variability in ROE is necessary.  The outlook is mixed; while the company shows financial strength, its market performance requires closer monitoring and a deeper understanding of the underlying factors influencing its growth trajectory.  The -10.3% expected return should be considered a potential scenario, not a guaranteed outcome.
