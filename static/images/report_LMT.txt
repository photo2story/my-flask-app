*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 44.0%  | 64.0%  | 15.0%  | 0.1    | 75.0   |

| 2021-2023  | 15.0%  | 79.3%  | 14.0%  | 0.6    | 105.8  |
| 2022-2024  | 2.0%   | 79.3%  | -19.0% | 0.5    | 113.5  |
| 2023-2025  | 6.0%   | 70.4%  | -57.0% | 0.3    | 117.8  |

*   **Analysis:** LMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 based on cumulative returns. The relative spread percentile indicates this underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range.

    The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals periods of both outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the market. Beta values generally indicate a moderate correlation with the market.  The inconsistent Alpha suggests LMT's performance is driven by company-specific factors rather than broad market trends. The high MDD values also suggest high risk. The recent negative Alpha values are concerning.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 504.49
*   **Previous Close:** 499.36
*   **Price Change:** 1.03%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 499.74
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 480.83
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 454.90

*   **Analysis:** The price is currently above all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), suggesting an upward trend in the short to medium term. The 1.03% change from the previous close indicates a positive price movement, and the price jump suggests a potential short-term positive catalyst.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 83.26 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.30
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** 1.0 (Positive - Short-Term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -136.1% (Long-Term Underperformance)

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high level of general market safety. However, the RSI is in overbought territory, which could indicate a potential pullback in the short term. The PPO is positive, supporting the upward trend identified by the moving averages. The Hybrid Signal recommends full investment.  The positive change in relative spread over the last 20 days aligns with the recent price increase, but the significantly negative expected return is a major concern, suggesting long-term underperformance against the S&P 500.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Analysis:** Recent news highlights positive developments, particularly regarding increased missile production and potential investment opportunities. The Pentagon's plan to increase missile production is a significant potential catalyst for LMT, as it suggests increased revenue and profitability. The articles suggesting LMT is exceeding market returns should be viewed cautiously in light of the underperformance revealed by the other data. It's important to note the inclusion of a Boeing analyst report; while perhaps not directly related to LMT, it could provide a broader context for the aerospace and defense industry.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (~2.58)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 17
*   **Target Price (Avg/High/Low):** 473.35 / 544.00 / 398.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not Available

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting a neutral outlook on the stock.  The average target price is below the current price, implying limited upside potential. The analyst opinions are not strongly positive or negative, which can be interpreted as a period of uncertainty about the company's near-term prospects.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 예상 EPS |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-07-22 | 7.29 | 6.52     |
| 2025-04-22 | 7.28 | 6.34     |
| 2025-01-28 | 7.67 | 6.62     |
| 2024-10-22 | 6.8  | 6.5      |
| 2024-07-23 | 6.85 | 6.46     |

*   **Analysis:** LMT has consistently beaten EPS estimates in the last five quarters. This indicates strong financial performance and good management execution. This positive EPS trend conflicts with the negative relative returns to the S\&P500. This suggests the market is valuing other aspects of the business, or there is a time-lag effect.

**6. Financial Information**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | \$18.16B  | 4.04%          |
| 2025-03-31 | \$17.96B  | 12.93%         |
| 2024-12-31 | \$18.62B  | 3.71%          |
| 2024-09-30 | \$17.10B  | 12.38%         |
| 2024-06-30 | \$18.12B  | 11.75%         |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE    |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-06-30 | \$5.33B   | 6.41%  |
| 2025-03-31 | \$6.68B   | 25.62% |
| 2024-12-31 | \$6.33B   | 8.32%  |
| 2024-09-30 | \$7.20B   | 22.54% |
| 2024-06-30 | \$6.17B   | 26.57% |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has been relatively stable over the past five quarters. However, the profit margin fluctuates significantly, with Q1 and Q3 2024 having notably higher margins than Q2 and Q4 2024, and Q2 2025. This could be due to the timing of contract milestones or cost variations. Equity has decreased, which is a potential concern. ROE also fluctuates, indicating varying levels of profitability on shareholder equity. The decreased equity coupled with fluctuating profit margins indicates inconsistent performance.

**7. Overall Summary & Recommendation**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Recent price momentum is positive, supported by moving averages and recent news.
    *   Strong earnings performance, consistently beating EPS estimates.
    *   High Market Risk Indicator suggests a generally safe investment environment.
    *   Recent news catalysts (Pentagon missile production push) could drive further growth.

*   **Negatives:**
    *   Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   Negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500.
    *   RSI in overbought territory, indicating potential short-term pullback.
    *   Analyst consensus is "Hold" with a target price below the current price.
    *   Fluctuating profit margins and declining equity.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, a neutral to cautious approach is warranted. The recent positive price action and potential news catalysts are encouraging, but the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and negative expected return are significant concerns.

*   **Short-Term:** A small, speculative position could be considered to capitalize on the recent momentum, but with strict stop-loss orders to manage risk given the overbought RSI.
*   **Long-Term:** A long-term investment is not recommended at this time due to the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the negative expected return. Further investigation into the causes of this underperformance is needed.
