**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT has shown consistent earnings beats but significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, reinforced by the negative long-term expected return. While the company shows some positive underlying financial performance in terms of EPS, this is not reflected in the stock price. Further investigation into the reasons for the market's negative valuation is needed. The high volatility in ROE also presents a cause for concern and should warrant more in-depth analysis of the company's financial health and strategy.  The relatively low RSI suggests the current downtrend might continue, but the consistently beaten EPS expectations could signal a potential turnaround point, although it is unclear when this might occur.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is recommended. The significant underperformance relative to the market and the negative long-term expected return suggest that LMT is not a strong investment at this time. However, the consistent EPS beats warrant further due diligence to assess the underlying fundamentals of the company and determine if the current market valuation accurately reflects its long-term prospects.  Considering the substantial negative expected return, significant caution is advised unless there's a clear catalyst suggesting improved market sentiment or a significant shift in the company's long-term growth strategy.
