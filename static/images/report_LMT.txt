**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT has shown consistent earnings beats and relatively stable revenue, indicating a healthy underlying business.  However, its stock price performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, potentially signaling a short-term bounce. The low beta indicates that LMT's performance is less correlated to the general market, which means this stock is less sensitive to market fluctuations. However, the low alpha indicates a lower rate of excess return compared to the market.  Before making any investment decisions, further analysis is needed, including assessing revenue growth trends (which are not explicitly detailed in the provided data), considering current market conditions, and reviewing analyst opinions and the broader market outlook â€“ information that is missing from the provided dataset. The substantial MDD values displayed across multiple years also need to be strongly considered when assessing risk.
