**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT's recent price action suggests short-term positive momentum, supported by exceeding earnings expectations. However, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the longer term, a high Market Risk Indicator, and a negative long-term expected return (-65%) raise concerns. The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought.  Investors should carefully consider the volatility of profit margins and ROE, and the overall risk associated with this investment before making any decisions.  The recent price jump needs further investigation to determine if it is sustainable.  Further fundamental analysis is recommended before investing.
