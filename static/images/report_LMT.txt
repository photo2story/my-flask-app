## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  As of the last data point, LMT's cumulative return is 83.20%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 120.36%.  This represents a difference of -37.2%.  The relative divergence, considering historical volatility, places LMT at the 25.1st percentile relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests LMT underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values, all showing Alpha as 0.0 and Beta fluctuating around 120. This is unusual and likely indicates an error in the data provided.  A beta of 120 suggests extraordinarily high volatility and correlation to the market compared to the typical range (0-2), and the consistently zero alpha is unlikely.  Further investigation into the source of this data is required.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly year over year, highlighting the volatility inherent in the defense sector.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values are also substantial and display considerable risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $506.29
* **5-day moving average:** $490.38
* **20-day moving average:** $482.88
* **60-day moving average:** $514.66

The closing price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price increase after a period of consolidation or decline.  The stock is currently trading below its 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent price change of +3.26% indicates a recent upswing but the long-term trend requires more analysis.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 61.54  (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.93 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum but not extremely strong)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -5.8% (This suggests potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon of two or more years.)
* **Price Change:** The significant one-day price increase (+3.26%) could reflect positive news or market sentiment, but needs further analysis to confirm if itâ€™s a sustained trend or just short-term fluctuation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin consistently beat earnings estimates in the most recent quarters.  While the overall trend shows profitability, the growth rate isn't consistently accelerating. This suggests consistent but potentially limited future earnings growth. More contextual information is needed, like the nature of the business and its inherent cyclicality, for more conclusive interpretation of the earnings.

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| 2024-10-22 | 6.8     | 6.5          | Beat       |
| 2024-07-23 | 6.85    | 6.46         | Beat       |
| 2024-04-23 | 6.39    | 5.82         | Beat       |
| 2024-01-23 | 7.88    | 7.26         | Beat       |
| 2023-10-17 | 6.73    | 6.67         | Beat       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been relatively stable in recent quarters, with fluctuations around $17-18 Billion. Profit margins have remained healthy in the 11-12% range. Equity has shown some volatility, possibly due to stock buybacks or other capital allocation strategies. ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently high, suggesting efficient use of shareholder capital. This is a positive sign.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT shows consistent profitability and strong ROE, but its stock price performance lags behind the S&P 500. While recent earnings have beaten expectations, the overall long-term growth rate may be limited. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, but the expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative.  The provided alpha and beta values are highly suspect and require validation.  Before making any investment decisions, more detailed fundamental analysis is crucial, including considering the geopolitical climate and its effect on defense spending.
