**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT shows strong fundamentals with consistently positive earnings surprises and generally high ROE. However, the stock's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-31.3% lag), negative expected return, and mixed technical indicators paint a complex picture.  The recent price bounce may be temporary.  Further analysis is needed to assess the sustainability of recent earnings, the reasons for underperformance versus the S&P 500, and the long-term growth potential.  A long-term investment strategy could be considered given the strong fundamentals, but close monitoring of the market and technical indicators is crucial.  The relatively high risk indicated by the MRI should also be carefully considered.
