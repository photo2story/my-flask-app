**1) Performance Comparison:**

Lockheed Martin's cumulative return (38.73%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500's return (76.18%) over the considered period.

The price is below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  However, it is above the 20-day moving average, indicating some short-term support.  The recent price drop of $2.72 reflects a recent negative market event.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin demonstrates strong earnings and generally healthy financial metrics. However, its recent stock performance lags behind the S&P 500, leading to a negative expected return compared to the market index.  The -57.4% expected return is a significant negative and requires careful consideration and further investigation into the underlying assumptions and market factors.  The mixed technical indicators and the recent price drop add to the uncertainty.  While the company's fundamentals appear sound, the underperformance relative to the market and the negative expected return raise concerns about the current investment attractiveness of LMT.  Further research into the reasons for the underperformance and the validity of the -57.4% expected return figure is crucial before making any investment decisions.
