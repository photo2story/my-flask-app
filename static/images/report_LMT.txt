Therefore, LMT underperformed VOO by 40.4 percentage points.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $483.37
* **5-day Moving Average:** $487.39
* **20-day Moving Average:** $498.73
* **60-day Moving Average:** $540.76

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.11 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.13 – A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, although weak.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -1.1 – This shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -7.4% – This suggests that LMT's expected return over the long term is 7.4% lower than the S&P 500.  Considering the current price is below the moving averages and the RSI is low, a 7.4% underperformance projection might be too pessimistic and warrants further investigation.  There is potential for a short-term bounce due to the oversold RSI condition.  However, the long-term outlook remains cautious given the persistent underperformance against the S&P 500.
