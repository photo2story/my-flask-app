2025-12-24 - Analysis Report
Here's a breakdown of Lockheed Martin (LMT) based on the provided data, including analysis and a comprehensive summary.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global aerospace, defense, security, and advanced technologies company.
*   **LMT Cumulative Return:** 30.70%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -70.2 (Relative Divergence: 8.6)

    *   LMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The divergence of -70.2 means LMT has provided a substantially lower cumulative return than VOO. The relative divergence of 8.6 suggests that the current divergence is near the low end of its historical range.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    *   The Alpha values fluctuate significantly. Note that, the alpha represents the excess return compared to the market (S&P 500)
    *   The Beta values are generally fluctuating to around zero, which means that LMT's stock price generally does not move as much as the market's (S&P 500).
    *   The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is very high, indicating substantial potential for losses during certain periods.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 474.13
*   **Last Market:** Price = 482.55, Previous Close = 483.57, Change = -0.21
*   **5-day SMA:** 476.108
*   **20-day SMA:** 462.2165
*   **60-day SMA:** 478.5287

    *   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This mixed signal indicates potential short-term upward momentum, but the 20-day SMA still being below the 60-day SMA suggests caution.

**3. Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 75.52 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.52
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (5 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.8 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -251.5

    *   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. However, the RSI is in overbought territory, which often signals a potential pullback. The negative expected return is highly concerning, indicating the model predicts significant underperformance if held long-term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative:** JP Morgan Downgrades Lockheed Martin citing cash flow concerns.
*   **Negative:** U.S. F-35 fleet fell short of readiness targets.
*   **Positive:** Lockheed Martin secures Tracking Layer contract.
*   **Mixed:** Articles discuss LMT's performance and potential for rebound, and stake trimming.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.62)
*   **Target Price:** 523.95 (Avg), 590 (High), 430 (Low)

    *   Analysts generally recommend holding the stock. The average target price suggests a potential upside.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Lockheed Martin's recent performance has been weak, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. The high MDD suggests the stock is volatile.
Technically, the stock is showing mixed signals. The RSI indicates overbought conditions, while the SMAs suggest potential short-term upward momentum, but overall caution.
The negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting the model anticipates significant future losses.
Analyst opinions are neutral (Hold rating), and the target price indicates a potential upside, but this contrasts with the negative outlook from other indicators. The recent news is mixed, with a significant downgrade and concerns about cash flow and F-35 readiness offsetting the positive contract news.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this data, **caution is advised**. While analysts have a neutral outlook, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the overbought RSI, the negative expected return, and the concerning news headlines suggest that there may be better investment opportunities available. A potential investor would want to investigate the reasons behind the cash flow concerns and F-35 issues before making any decisions. The negative expected return alone should be a significant deterrent.
