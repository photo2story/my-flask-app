**Summary:**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Underperformance:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, reflected in the large negative divergence and recent negative alpha. The extremely negative expected return is a serious concern.
*   **Recent Price:** Short-term upward price movement, but the RSI suggests it may be approaching overbought levels.
*   **Risk:**  Low Market Risk Indicator (MRI) is positive.
*   **Earnings:**  Consistent EPS beats are a positive sign of operational efficiency.
*   **Financials:** Stable revenue but fluctuating profit margins and ROE.

*   **Analyst Opinion:**  Varied analyst opinions with a modest upside potential based on the average target price, but lacking strong consensus.

**Overall:**

The data suggests caution regarding LMT. While the company is operationally sound (consistent EPS beats) and in a generally stable industry, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, fluctuating profitability, and especially the very negative expected return raise concerns about future investment prospects. The mixed analyst opinions and recent negative changes in relative divergence further contribute to a cautious outlook.
