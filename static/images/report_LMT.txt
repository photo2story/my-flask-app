**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Based on the data and news, here is a comprehensive analysis of Lockheed Martin (LMT):

*   **Underperformance:** LMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given time frame, which should cause concern.

Given the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, volatile historical performance, and negative expected return, caution is warranted.
