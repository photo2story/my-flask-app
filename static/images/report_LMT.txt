2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Lockheed Martin (LMT) based on the provided data:

**1) Return Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** Lockheed Martin Corp. is a global aerospace, defense, security, and technology company.
*   **Return Divergence:** LMT's cumulative return (26.11%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (91.40%), resulting in a divergence of -79.0.  This divergence is relatively low within its historical range.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**
    *   The data shows fluctuating CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over the past several 3-year periods.
    *   MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently very high, around 90-99%, indicating significant potential downside risk during those periods. This seems unusually high and may be an error in the data.
    *   Alpha is generally negative, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark, except for 2017-2019 and 2021-2023.
    *   Beta has generally been relatively low or moderate, suggesting lower volatility than the market and a low degree of correlation between the stock and market return, but recently the beta value is close to 0. This recent change suggests that the company's stock may be influenced by specific factors, independent of the overall market.
    *   Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions) has increased significantly over the period, indicating growth in the company's value.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $483.67 (down slightly from the previous close of $488.0)
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: $485.86
    *   20-day SMA: $473.93
    *   60-day SMA: $476.85

    The 5-day SMA is above both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA, indicating a potential pullback.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - This suggests the model currently views LMT as a relatively good investment opportunity.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 62.65 - This is approaching overbought territory (above 70), but isn't there yet. It indicates recent buying pressure.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.3394 -  This indicates a slight upward trend in momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  Recommends buying 90% of available cash (1 share - Safe), with a 0% cash ratio by 2025-12-09.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:**  2.0 (+) "단기상승" (Short-term Increase) -  Indicates that LMT has recently outperformed its comparison.
*   **Price Fluctuation Note:** The price change of -0.89 from the previous close does not suggest a significant fluctuation event.
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The model predicts little to no excess return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, suggesting LMT will perform on par with the market.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines primarily focus on new defense deals for Lockheed Martin, specifically contracts related to Taiwan and the Pentagon. These contracts boost the company's backlog and are generally positive for the stock.
*   However, one article notes that LMT stock pulled back despite $769M in new defense deals, suggesting that other factors might be influencing the stock price.
*   Another article mentions Merit Financial Group LLC cutting its position in Lockheed Martin, which could be a negative signal.
*   An article on Yahoo Finance asks "What's Going On With Lockheed Martin Stock?" indicating there might be some uncertainty or specific events affecting the stock's performance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold - The average analyst rating suggests a neutral stance on the stock.
*   **Target Price:** The average target price of $523.95 suggests a potential upside from the current price of $483.67. However, the low target price of $430.00 indicates some analysts see significant downside risk.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** The lack of information on rating changes makes it difficult to assess the recent sentiment of analysts.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin is currently showing mixed signals.

*   **Positive Factors:** Recent defense contract wins, positive MRI, short-term positive momentum (indicated by SMAs and relative divergence), and potential upside based on the average analyst target price.
*   **Negative Factors:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, largely negative Alpha historically, potential high downside risk (if MDD data is accurate), neutral analyst consensus, and mixed news headlines (while contract wins are positive, some articles indicate uncertainty or negative factors affecting the stock). Furthermore, a very low beta is generally undesirable.

**Conclusion:**

The data suggests that while Lockheed Martin benefits from defense contracts and exhibits short-term positive momentum, the long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the possibility of very large drawdowns (MDD needs to be verified), and the neutral analyst consensus indicate caution. Further, if we are considering long term investment, an expected return of 0.0% makes the company an undesirable investment compared to other stocks or even S&P500.
