Over the period analyzed, LMT's cumulative return (107.85%) lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (127.58%) by 19.73%.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, sits at the 40.05th percentile, indicating it has underperformed the S&P 500 more often than not during the observed period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $542.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $536.64
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $547.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $572.47

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The proximity to the 5-day moving average indicates potential support, but further downward pressure is a possibility given the longer-term trends.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 49.44 - Near neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.07 - Slightly negative, indicating bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -13.34 - Suggests a recent short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided data doesn't include the detail required to reliably forecast future outperformance against the S&P 500.  A 0% expected return implies that no outperformance is anticipated relative to the S&P 500 in a long-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold strategy. This should be viewed with caution as long term forecasting is inherently uncertain.

**4. Recent Earnings & Outlook:**

Lockheed Martin has consistently exceeded earnings per share (EPS) expectations in recent quarters.  However, the most recent quarter (2024-10-22) shows a slight deceleration, with EPS of $6.8 compared to an expectation of $6.5. While exceeding expectations is positive, the narrowing margin might warrant monitoring.  Continued strong earnings are essential to support the current valuation.

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue remains relatively stable, while profit margins show some fluctuation, indicating potential challenges in maintaining consistent profitability.  The decrease in profit margin from 2023-12-31 to 2024-06-30 could be an area of further investigation.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) show significant variability, suggesting fluctuations in the company's financial health.  High ROE in some quarters indicates effective capital utilization, while lower ROE might point towards less efficient operations or increased risk.

**7. Overall Summary:**

LMT has demonstrated consistent earnings beats but lags behind the S&P 500 in cumulative returns. Recent price action indicates a potential short-term bearish trend. While fundamental indicators like earnings are positive, technical indicators and profit margin fluctuations warrant monitoring.   The significant variability in financial metrics like ROE raises concerns regarding consistent performance.  A comprehensive analysis necessitates review of the latest news and analyst opinions, providing more context regarding market sentiment and future outlook.  A long-term buy and hold strategy (2+ years) would need to justify its outperformance over the broader S&P 500 given the current data.
