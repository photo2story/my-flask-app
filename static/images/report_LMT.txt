**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT has shown consistent earnings beats but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While recent earnings are positive and some technical indicators hint at potential short-term upward movement, the overall picture is mixed. The considerably negative long-term expected return (-20%) relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and the long-term outlook is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility (indicated by the Beta) also needs careful consideration.
