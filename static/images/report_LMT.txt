2025-02-12 - Analysis Report
## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Report

**0. Overview:**

Lockheed Martin Corp is a global security and aerospace company that engages in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

LMT's cumulative return of 62.1% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 120.2% over the analyzed period. The difference is -58.1%, placing it at the 4.2nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-62.3% to 37.8%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta) and varying levels of alpha (excess return).  While some periods show strong positive alpha (e.g., 2017-2019), others reveal significant negative alpha (e.g., 2018-2020). The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over the period.  The high beta values (generally above 0.1) indicate significant sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Note the inconsistent CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) in several periods, which highlights the volatility inherent in LMT's performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $449.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $448.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $471.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $493.02

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The recent slight price increase (0.25$) is minimal relative to the overall downward trend indicated by the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 22.4  - Indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential for a price bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.42 -  Suggests a bearish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -2.8 - Confirms the short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -46.9% -  This indicates a significantly lower expected return than the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming current trends persist.  This large negative value warrants further investigation into the underlying reasons. The relatively small price increase mentioned in point 2 doesn't significantly alter this long-term expectation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 7.67     | 6.63         | 1.04       |
| 2024-10-22 | 6.80     | 6.50         | 0.30       |
| 2024-07-23 | 6.85     | 6.46         | 0.39       |
| 2024-04-23 | 6.39     | 5.82         | 0.57       |
| 2024-01-23 | 7.88     | 7.26         | 0.62       |

LMT has consistently exceeded expected EPS in recent quarters. This positive trend contrasts with the negative overall performance against the S&P 500 and negative expected return.  Further investigation is needed to understand this discrepancy.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.62B    | 3.71%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.10B    | 12.38%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $18.12B    | 11.75%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $17.20B    | 11.59%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $18.87B    | 12.16%        |

Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains relatively stable. Profit margins show significant variation, with a notable drop in the last quarter (2024 Q4). This requires further investigation into the underlying causes.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $6.33     | 8.32    |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.20     | 22.54   |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.17     | 26.57   |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.65     | 23.23   |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.83     | 27.30   |

Equity and ROE show significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  The drop in both equity and ROE in Q4 2024 aligns with the lower profit margin in the same period and requires further analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin's performance relative to the S&P 500 is currently negative, despite consistently exceeding earnings expectations.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the overall trend remains bearish. The significantly negative projected long-term return warrants caution.  The variability in profit margins, ROE, and equity, coupled with the inconsistent alpha and beta values, highlights the inherent risk and volatility associated with LMT.  Further investigation into the causes of the Q4 2024 financial performance drop and the large negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The positive EPS surprises need to be reconciled with the overall negative performance against the market and negative long-term projections.
