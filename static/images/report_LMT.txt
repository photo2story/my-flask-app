## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  Over the reviewed period, LMT's cumulative return (76.67%) lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (117.56%) by 40.9 percentage points.  This places its relative performance at the 21.3rd percentile of its historical range (considering a minimum of -62.2% and a maximum of 37.9% difference from the S&P 500).  While LMT shows consistent positive CAGR across most periods (except 2018-2020), its alpha consistently remains around 0.1, indicating a slight outperformance relative to the market, but less pronounced than suggested by earlier years. Beta fluctuates, indicating variable sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $486.49
* **Last Market Price:** $488.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $485.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $505.48
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $547.99

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing and last market price indicates minor recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (22.8):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a buying opportunity. However, this should be considered alongside other factors.
* **PPO (-0.19):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+2.3):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data suggests no significant expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investments at the current moment.  A 0.0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 requires further investigation; it might reflect a neutral outlook rather than a negative one. The recent downturn (as evidenced by moving averages) could influence this expectation.  A 488.13 last market price would marginally alter the assessment, but doesn't necessitate a change in classification (no significant spike up or down).
