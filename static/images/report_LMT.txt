**6) Overall Analysis:**

LMT has shown strong earnings growth, consistently beating expectations. However, its stock price performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500. The high beta suggests increased volatility.  The negative expected return (-102.2%) needs further investigation to understand its basis. While the company exhibits fundamental strength in its earnings, its underperformance relative to the market and the high volatility present significant risks.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the current valuation reflects the company's earnings potential and to understand the reasons for the substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  A comprehensive analysis would require considering factors beyond the data provided, such as geopolitical factors affecting the defense industry and the company's long-term strategic plans.
