**0) Introduction:** Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company that designs, develops, manufactures, integrates, and sustains advanced technology systems, products, and services.  This report analyzes LMT's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and assessing its financial health and future prospects.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

LMT's cumulative return is 37.04%, significantly lower than the S&P 500's 72.42%.  The difference is -35.4%, placing it at the 30.1st percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (where a range of -63.8% to +30.7% is normalized to 0-100%).  The alpha and beta values in the provided table show fluctuating outperformance (positive alpha) and underperformance (negative alpha) relative to the market (beta consistently above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market). Note that the alpha and beta are calculated over different periods, and these results do not provide a conclusive long-term performance assessment.

| 2017-2019  | 39.0% | 65.6% | 6.0% | 80.3 |
| 2018-2020  | -26.0% | 65.6% | -56.0% | 75.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 12.0% | 63.2% | 0.6 | 77.5 |
| 2020-2022  | -25.0% | 63.2% | 0.6 | 108.8 |
| 2021-2023  | 22.0% | 60.6% | 0.4 | 104.1 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $458.33
* **Change from Previous Close:** -$1.24 (a decrease of 0.27%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $468.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $453.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $453.03

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downtrend, but above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential support level.  The recent price drop of $1.24 should be considered relatively minor within the context of the stock's overall price.

* **PPO:** 0.3881 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -51.2% (This is a significantly negative prediction; the basis for this calculation needs further explanation).  This prediction needs further clarification as the method for calculating expected return is unspecified and the very negative result warrants skepticism.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

LMT has shown strong earnings growth, consistently exceeding expectations. However, its stock performance lags behind the S&P 500, showing a lower cumulative return.  The provided technical indicators present a mixed picture, with some suggesting upward momentum and others indicating a more neutral or slightly bearish outlook. The highly variable profit margins and ROE raise concerns about the company's financial stability and require further in-depth investigation. The extremely negative expected return of -51.2% needs to be investigated and validated given its magnitude.  A more comprehensive analysis is needed, including a deeper look into the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and potential risks, before making any investment decisions.  More information is needed to explain the -51.2% expected return figure.
