### 7. Overall Summary & Recommendation

Lockheed Martin (LMT) shows a mixed picture.  While it consistently beats EPS estimates and maintains strong ROE in most quarters, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative expected return is particularly concerning and suggests the model anticipates continued underperformance. Recent news indicates volatility and uncertainty.

**Recommendation:**  Given the significant underperformance, negative expected return, and high historical drawdowns, a **SELL** or **HOLD** recommendation is warranted.  Investors should closely monitor news, analyst opinions, and the company's ability to improve its relative performance against the broader market.  The sharp decline in profit margin and ROE in Q4 2024 needs further investigation to understand if it is a temporary issue or a sign of a larger problem. The BUY recommendation from the Hybrid Signal should be viewed with caution.
