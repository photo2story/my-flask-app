**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT has shown strong earnings growth, consistently beating expectations.  However, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, with a large negative relative divergence.  While technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the bearish trend indicated by moving averages needs to be considered.  The high volatility in profit margins and ROE warrants further investigation into the company's financial health.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards, considering the projected underperformance compared to the broader market.  More in-depth analysis, including qualitative factors and future projections, is needed for a comprehensive evaluation.
