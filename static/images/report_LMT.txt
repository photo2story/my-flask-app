*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance vs. the S&P 500, volatile profit margins, fluctuating ROE,  negative long-term expected return compared to the S\&P 500, and inconsistent Alpha and Beta.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Neutral ("Hold").

**Conclusion:**

LMT appears to be a company with solid fundamentals but facing challenges in translating those fundamentals into market-beating returns. The large contract win provides a near-term boost, but the negative expected return is concerning. While the recent news is positive, the technical indicators and long-term outlook suggest caution. The analyst consensus aligns with this cautious view.
