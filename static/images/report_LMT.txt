While LMT has consistently exceeded earnings expectations recently,  this positive trend alone doesn't fully explain the substantial underperformance against the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for this divergence is needed.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis. This missing data is a crucial gap in the provided information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, with a large negative return difference. While recent earnings have been positive,  technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest a bearish sentiment and oversold conditions. The extremely negative long-term expected return is a major concern. The absence of key financial data hampers a full assessment.  Further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind the underperformance, considering factors beyond the provided data, including macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, and company-specific events.  The high negative expected return suggests that this stock is currently not a strong candidate for long-term investment relative to the S&P 500.
