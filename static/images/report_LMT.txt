## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  As of the last data point, LMT's cumulative return (77.43%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%), resulting in a difference of -40.9%.  This places LMT at the 21.4th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500, indicating underperformance.

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance over the years, ranging from a high of 44% to a low of -2%, highlighting the cyclical nature of the defense industry.  The consistently high Beta (around 116) signifies high volatility and sensitivity to overall market movements.  The Alpha of 0 suggests that LMT's performance hasn't significantly outpaced the market after accounting for its beta.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $490.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $485.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $481.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $515.77

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term. The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a notable price drop recently.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (50.28):**  Near the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (0.67):** Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+1.9):**  A positive change indicates short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (-7.3%):**  This signifies an anticipated underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if invested now.  The current price of $490.32, coupled with a negative expected return, doesn't suggest a compelling entry point for long-term investors seeking to outperform the market.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT has demonstrated strong earnings beats but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently.  While the company enjoys strong profitability and a solid reputation, the current valuation and negative expected return relative to the market don't present a compelling case for investment at this time, especially for long-term investors seeking market-beating returns. The recent price decline and the indicators suggest caution before considering investment. Further research into industry trends and future projections is recommended.  The relatively high beta further emphasizes the risk associated with investing in LMT.
