    *   Neutral analyst consensus with limited upside potential.
    *   Very Negative Expected Return.

**Conclusion:**

Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. While recent momentum may continue in the short term, long-term investors should carefully consider the historical underperformance, the overbought condition, and the negative expected return. The hybrid signal suggested some allocation is acceptable.
