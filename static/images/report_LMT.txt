## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Performance Review

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

LMT's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price action shows upward momentum, but key indicators suggest a mixed outlook. Earnings have generally exceeded expectations, and financial data reveals strong profitability, although with some quarter-to-quarter volatility.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  LMT's cumulative return of 39.53% is considerably lower than the S&P 500's 82.57%. The current divergence of -43.0% places it at the 22nd percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (-63.8% to 30.7%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed performance. While CAGR has fluctuated, the Beta consistently remains high (above 0.5), indicating a higher sensitivity to market movements than the overall market. Alpha values are generally positive, except in the initial years, suggesting that the stock's performance has outperformed the market relative to its beta in certain periods, but generally not over the longer term. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has shown a steady increase over time.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $466.81
* **5-day Moving Average:** $462.97
* **20-day Moving Average:** $456.54
* **60-day Moving Average:** $452.12

The recent price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average suggests recent price stability.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.52 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.1775 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -10.0% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** -79.4% (This figure seems unusually low and needs further clarification.  It might be a relative return compared to the S&P 500 over a longer timeframe, and the negative sign likely means that LMT is expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term by this amount).

The recent price change of 0.7 suggests a minor upward move, not a significant jump or drop.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT shows strong earnings, generally exceeding expectations.  However, the stock's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, and the expected return of -79.4% raises serious concerns, requiring further investigation to understand the source of this projection. While the company displays financial strength in terms of revenue and, generally, profitability, the volatility in profit margins and ROE, coupled with the negative expected return and the relatively high beta, suggests a need for cautious assessment.  Further research into the -79.4% expected return figure and the Q4 2024 financial performance dip are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The short-term price action shows upward momentum, but the long-term outlook requires careful consideration of the risks involved.
