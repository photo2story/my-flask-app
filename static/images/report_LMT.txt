* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data does not offer a basis for projecting a specific long-term return exceeding the S&P 500.  A 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 means the model predicts no outperformance.  The 0% should be interpreted as a lack of information to provide a better estimate, not necessarily an expectation of zero outperformance.
