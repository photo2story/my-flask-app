**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT has shown strong earnings beats but significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, resulting in a negative alpha and substantial underperformance.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the negative PPO and the negative expected return raise concerns. Recent financial data reveal some volatility in profit margins and ROE.  While the company demonstrates consistent earnings beats, the significant divergence from the market and the negative long-term expected return warrant caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the Q4 2024 drop in profit margin and ROE would be beneficial before making any investment decisions.
