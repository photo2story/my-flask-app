2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Lockheed Martin (LMT) based on the provided data, broken down into sections:

**1. Return Rate Comparison & Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** LMT (Lockheed Martin Corp) - A global aerospace, defense, security, and advanced technologies company.
*   **LMT Cumulative Return:** 29.61%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 99.09%
*   **Divergence:** -68.3 (Relative Divergence: 10.4)

**Analysis:**

LMT significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period reflected in the cumulative return data. The negative divergence of -68.3 indicates a substantial gap in performance. The relative divergence of 10.4 suggests that LMT's current divergence from VOO is near the lower end of its historical range, meaning it *could* potentially be positioned for a rebound relative to the market, but this is not guaranteed.

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, showing periods of strong growth (2015-2017) and decline (2018-2020). Recent years show low single-digit growth.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown indicates significant risk and volatility in LMT's performance.
*   **Alpha:** Generally negative, indicating underperformance relative to its expected return based on its beta. The recent negative Alpha values are concerning.
*   **Beta:** Generally low, suggesting that LMT is less volatile than the market. However, beta fluctuates and has been both positive and negative.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 470.14

*   **5-day SMA:** 477.33
*   **20-day SMA:** 461.92
*   **60-day SMA:** 478.70

**Analysis:**

The current price is below both the 5-day and 60-day SMAs but above the 20-day SMA. This suggests a potential short-term downtrend but might also indicate a period of consolidation. The recent small price decrease reported in 'Last-market' doesn't give a full picture, but if the change is large (sharp rebound/decline), it reflects the stock fluctuation issue.
