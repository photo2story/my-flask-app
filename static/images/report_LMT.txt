**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $432.15
* **Previous Close:** $454.78
* **Change:** -$4.98 (a decrease of ~1.1%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $447.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $454.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $456.59

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The significant one-day drop highlights a potential short-term negative sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk category) This suggests a higher level of market risk associated with LMT.
* **RSI:** 29.92 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.271 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +16.5 (Short-term upward trend, despite recent price decline)
* **Expected Return:** -77.9% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further clarification.  Is this a 2-year projected return? This should be described in the report.)


The combination of a high MRI, low RSI, negative PPO, and a large negative expected return paints a bearish picture for LMT, however, the positive short-term divergence suggests potential for short-term recovery. The significant price drop of -$4.98 warrants further investigation into underlying news and market events that might be causing this decline.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 예상 EPS | Difference |

Equity and ROE show some variability, with ROE particularly fluctuating significantly.  More analysis is needed to understand the drivers behind this volatility.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT has shown strong earnings growth, exceeding expectations. However, its stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, showing high market sensitivity and negative alpha in many periods. Recent price action indicates bearish sentiment, supported by technical indicators (high MRI, negative PPO) despite a recent short-term uptrend signal.  The extremely negative long-term expected return (-77.9%) requires clarification and further investigation.  Before making any investment decision, a more in-depth analysis of the underlying reasons for the recent price drop, as well as a more detailed understanding of the provided -77.9% expected return figure, is needed.  Further investigation into the causes of fluctuations in revenue and profit margin, and equity and ROE is also warranted.
