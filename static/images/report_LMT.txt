## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  The cumulative return of LMT is 105.02%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 123.86%.  This represents a current lag of -18.84% for LMT compared to the benchmark.  The relative lag, considering historical performance fluctuations (max: 42.82%, min: -61.52%), places LMT at the 40.9th percentile. This indicates LMT's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is within its historical range of variability, but still significantly behind.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying Alpha and Beta values across different periods.  While Beta generally hovers around 0.7-0.8, indicating a similar volatility to the market, Alpha is inconsistent, showing periods of outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha).  This suggests that LMT's performance is somewhat market-driven, but not consistently superior.  The company's market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over time.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) also varies, demonstrating inconsistent growth. Maximum Drawdown (MDD) suggests significant potential for losses, especially in the 2019-2021 period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 534.83 (Last Market: 534.97)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 553.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 557.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 574.23

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the moving averages suggests a potentially oversold condition.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.53 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory (generally below 30 is considered oversold), suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.19 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -28.66 – This shows a significant recent decline in relative performance.

Given the current price (534.97) is near the closing price and not significantly higher, a sharp rebound is unlikely based on provided data, although the RSI suggests oversold conditions.  The expected return is 0.0%, meaning there is no significant predicted return relative to the S&P 500 for a long-term investment (2+ years).

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

Lockheed Martin has consistently exceeded earnings per share (EPS) expectations in recent quarters.  The most recent quarter (2024-10-22) showed EPS of 6.8, exceeding the expectation of 6.5.  While the company has displayed strong earnings, a consistent outperformance of expectations doesn't guarantee future gains and needs to be weighed with other factors like market conditions and sector performance.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, though profit margins have shown some fluctuation.  This suggests the company is managing costs effectively but might face challenges maintaining high profit margins consistently.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity and Return on Equity (ROE) show some variability.  High ROE indicates strong profitability, but fluctuations point to potential risks or varied business performance.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires information from news sources like Shacknews and Finbold within the last two days.  Please provide recent news articles to complete this analysis.)*  This section would include any recent earnings announcements, market outlook discussions, analyst ratings, and significant company news impacting the stock price.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

LMT has shown inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500. While it has had periods of outperformance, its recent performance lags behind the market.  The technical indicators suggest the stock may be oversold, creating a potential buying opportunity for some investors.  However, the relatively high maximum drawdown values in previous periods highlight the risk associated with this stock.  Strong earnings and consistent profitability need to be considered within a broader market context and alongside sector-specific factors.   The absence of recent news prevents a complete analysis of immediate market sentiment.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, LMT presents a mixed investment picture.  While the company demonstrates strong earnings and profitability, its recent performance lags the market. The oversold conditions indicated by RSI might present a buying opportunity, but the historical volatility and the current below-average relative performance should be carefully considered.   A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions, along with a broader macroeconomic assessment, is crucial before making any investment decision.  Further research is strongly recommended before investing.
