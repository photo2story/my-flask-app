## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  Over the analyzed period, LMT's cumulative return (64.43%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return (119.94%). The difference is -55.5%, placing it at the 6.8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance over different time periods, ranging from significant gains to substantial losses, highlighting the volatility of its performance relative to the market.  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests that LMT's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta), with little evidence of significant alpha generation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $454.36
* **5-day Moving Average:** $481.95
* **20-day Moving Average:** $482.22
* **60-day Moving Average:** $507.73

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent price change (-$0.68) reflects a minor decline, but it is important to consider this within the context of the larger downward trend suggested by the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (45.65):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a near-term bounce but not a strong buy signal.
* **PPO (-0.1983):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-14.6%):** Indicates a recent period of underperformance relative to the market.
* **Expected Return (-28%):**  The projected long-term (2+ years) underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern. This negative expected return warrants caution.
* **Price Change:** The recent slight price drop (-0.675486861610556) is not significant enough to suggest a sharp reversal or significant price movement.

| 2024-01-23 | 7.88   | 7.26          | 0.62       | Beat      |

LMT has consistently beaten EPS expectations in recent quarters.  This positive trend is a mitigating factor against the negative outlook derived from other analyses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates slightly quarter-to-quarter, but overall remains strong. Profit margins show some volatility, exhibiting a significant drop in Q4 2024 to 3.71%, which needs further investigation to understand underlying causes.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity values fluctuate, and ROE has been exceptionally high in certain quarters but has shown some decline in recent quarters (especially Q4 2024), which requires more detailed financial analysis to ascertain the reasons for the dip.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LMT's recent earnings have been positive, consistently exceeding expectations. However, the stock's performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend. The projected long-term underperformance (-28%) is a serious concern.  While the company's fundamentals appear relatively strong, the market's valuation of LMT is currently significantly lower compared to the overall market represented by the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the causes of the Q4 2024 drop in profit margin and ROE is necessary to fully assess the risk-reward profile.  Investors should exercise caution and potentially consider a wait-and-see approach before making any significant investment decisions.  Additional due diligence, including examination of future earnings estimates and a deeper dive into the companyâ€™s financial statements, is strongly recommended.
