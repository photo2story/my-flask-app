*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows fluctuating performance. Some periods show positive growth, while others show significant declines.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, showing risk. The MDD is relatively high, indicating significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is generally negative, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark (risk-adjusted).  The negative alpha suggests that LMT has not been generating excess returns for the risk taken.  The large negative alpha in 2018-2020 and 2023-2025 are concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally below 1, suggesting LMT is less volatile than the market. However, the Beta has decreased in recent years to 0.2, indicating a low correlation to the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in Billions.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 497.07
*   **Last Market Close:** Price: 497.07, Previous Close: 483.67, Change: 2.77
*   **5-day SMA:** 488.13
*   **20-day SMA:** 476.45
*   **60-day SMA:** 476.62

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term upward trend. The positive change from the previous close supports this observation.  The 5-day SMA is above the 20 and 60-day SMA further suggesting upward momentum.

**3. Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 66.17
*   **PPO:** 0.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 2.1 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -194.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI indicates a medium investment recommendation, suggesting a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 66.17 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), which could signal a potential pullback.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is positive, indicating that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average. This supports an upward trend, but the value is low.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying with most available cash, likely due to the recent price increase.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The increase in relative divergence supports the recent upward price movement.
*   **Expected Return:** The *very* negative expected return of -194.1% is extremely concerning. This signals a high degree of risk and suggests that the model predicts significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. This number is so far out of range that it suggests a potential error in the model or calculation.

Investors should approach LMT with caution and carefully consider the potential risks before investing.  The very low Beta might indicate that the stock is becoming less correlated with the overall market.  The extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation to determine if it is an accurate reflection of future prospects or a calculation error.
