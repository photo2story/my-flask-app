    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent decrease in relative divergence indicates short-term downward momentum, aligning with the slight price decrease from the previous close.
    *   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return of -251.0% is extremely concerning. This suggests that, based on the model, long-term investment in LMT from this point is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500. This is a major red flag.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Key Themes:**
    *   **Contract Extensions:** Multiple news articles highlight Lockheed Martin securing major contract extensions from the Pentagon. This is generally positive news, suggesting stable or increasing revenue streams.
    *   **Analyst Opinions:** There are mixed opinions, ranging from articles questioning if LMT shares will rebound to discussions about LMT as a top space stock.
    *   **Institutional Activity:** One article mentions Oak Harvest Investment Services lowering their stake in Lockheed Martin. This could be a sign of concern from institutional investors.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Key:** Hold
*   **Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell):** 2.62 (~Hold)
*   **Opinions:** 19
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 523.95 / 590.00 / 430.00
*   **Analysis:** The consensus among analysts is to "Hold" LMT, with an average target price of $523.95. This suggests a potential upside from the current price, but it's not a strong buy signal.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** Lockheed Martin is currently showing mixed signals. While recent contract extensions provide a positive outlook for revenue, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 historically. The technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback due to overbought conditions, while the extremely negative expected return is a major cause for concern.
*   **Overall Impression:**
    *   **Short-Term:** The stock may experience a short-term pullback. The positive news related to contract extensions could provide some support.
    *   **Long-Term:** The long-term outlook is uncertain. The negative expected return, historical underperformance, and fluctuating alpha/beta values warrant caution. The analyst consensus of "Hold" reinforces this neutral stance.
*   **Recommendation:** Due to the extremely negative expected return, significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and mixed analyst opinions, it would be prudent to avoid initiating new positions or consider reducing existing holdings in LMT. More investigation into the reasons behind the negative expected return is warranted. The positive news regarding contract extensions should be weighed against the negative indicators before making any investment decisions.
