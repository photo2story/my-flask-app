**8. Summary:**

LMT has shown solid, if not spectacular, performance compared to the S&P 500. While its recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, its consistent earnings beats, healthy financial statements, and relatively low sensitivity to market movements (at least in the most recent periods) suggest it could be a worthwhile investment for long-term investors. However, a deeper dive into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial to assess the current market sentiment and potential risks.  The 0% expected return is overly conservative and should be reevaluated after including information from 7.
