## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) is a global security and aerospace company.  As of the last data point, LMT's cumulative return is 103.55%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has returned 124.78%.  This represents a difference of -21.23%. The relative divergence, considering historical performance variations, places LMT at the 38.61% percentile relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests LMT's underperformance relative to the broader market over the period considered.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows fluctuating alpha (ranging from -54.5% to 42.1%) and a relatively stable beta around 0.7-0.8, indicating a moderate correlation with the overall market.  However, the recent alpha of 0.2-0.3 suggests a lower correlation.  This variability highlights the need for caution in extrapolating past performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $530.96 (Last market: $532.72)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $545.69
* **20-day Moving Average:** $553.55
* **60-day Moving Average:** $573.88

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. The recent closing price of $532.72 is slightly above the reported closing price, which might reflect minor intraday fluctuations.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (38.85):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce back but not confirming an uptrend.
* **PPO (-0.32):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (-32.31):** Shows a recent decline in the stock's performance compared to the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% over a long-term horizon (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a crucial point. This implies that, based on the current data and analysis, there is no strong indication of outperformance over the S&P 500 for long-term investors.  This zero return expectation should be carefully reviewed in the context of other factors.
* **$532.72 Price Consideration:** This minor discrepancy from the closing price reflects normal market fluctuations; it does not indicate a significant upward or downward surge.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows some variability in EPS, with some quarters exceeding expectations and others falling short.  The most recent quarter (2024-10-22) reported EPS of $6.8, slightly above the expected $6.5. This reflects a positive surprise.  However, a single quarter's performance should not be interpreted in isolation.  Further analysis is needed to assess long-term trends.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, though profit margins fluctuate slightly.  This suggests a consistent revenue stream, but there might be some pressure on profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE shows volatility but generally remains strong, indicating efficient use of capital.  However, the significant drop in equity in 2023-09-30 warrants further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires real-time data.  Please provide recent news articles and analyst reports from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD for a complete analysis.)*  This section would include a summary of any recent news impacting LMT's stock price, including earnings calls, analyst upgrades/downgrades, and any significant market events.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

LMT shows mixed signals. While it has a history of strong returns (as reflected in past CAGR figures),  recent performance has lagged the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend, but the RSI is close to oversold territory which could trigger a bounce back.  While recent earnings have been relatively positive,  the lack of a strong expected return above the S&P 500, and variability in financial metrics needs further analysis. Further investigation into the news and market outlook (section 6), incorporating recent analyst opinions and financial performance highlights are critical for a complete investment decision.

**8. Recommendation:**

A thorough review of recent news (section 6) and a comprehensive understanding of the company's strategy and future outlook are necessary before making an investment decision.  The current data suggests a neutral to slightly bearish outlook in the short term.  The 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term requires careful consideration of other investment options before committing to long-term investment in LMT.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended.
