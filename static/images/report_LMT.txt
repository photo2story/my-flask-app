**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate varies significantly, showing periods of strong growth (2015-2017) and significant declines (2018-2020).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility in LMT's returns. It remains around 79-80% in recent years.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is frequently negative, suggesting that LMT often underperforms its benchmark after accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:** The Beta fluctuates, sometimes indicating less volatility than the market (Beta < 1) and sometimes indicating more (Beta > 1).  It has been positive in recent periods, suggesting it moves somewhat in line with the market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 446.80
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 452.53, Previous Close: 448.35, Change: 0.93
*   **5-day SMA:** 447.92
*   **20-day SMA:** 458.79
*   **60-day SMA:** 479.76

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price closed lower than the last market data, implying a drop-off in price during after-hours trading.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a *downward trend* in the short to medium term. The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, further confirming this.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Market Risk Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 43.24
*   **PPO:** -0.31
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash 0% Buy 90% of cash (3 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -11.5 (Negative - indicating a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -908.5 (Expected *negative* excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests that, based on broader market factors, the risk-reward profile is moderately attractive.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 43.24 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30) but isn't there yet. It suggests the stock *may* be nearing a potential rebound, but further confirmation is needed.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, which further confirms a downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a "Buy" recommendation, suggesting that now is an opportune moment to allocate funds to the stock. The "Safe" designation and MRI score of 0.8 implies moderate risk.
*   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The *extremely* negative expected return is a major red flag. This suggests a very pessimistic outlook for LMT's long-term performance compared to the overall market. *This number seems unusually low and warrants further investigation of the model producing this output. It may be an outlier or calculation error.*

*   **[2025-12-01] $LMT stock is down 3% today.**
*   **[2025-12-05] Marshall Wace LLP Cuts Stock Position.** This indicates institutional investors are reducing their stake, a potentially negative signal.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed.  The stock decline and institutional selling are negative. The "Rises Higher Than Market" headline is an outlier and requires further examination to understand the context. The earnings season question reflects investor uncertainty.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Neutral (indicated by the dash)
*   **Opinions:** 18
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 528.17 / 630.00 / 430.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes indicated

**Analysis:**  The neutral consensus and lack of recent rating changes suggest analysts are cautiously optimistic about LMT's potential. The average target price of $528.17 represents a significant upside from the current price, but the wide range ($430 to $630) reflects uncertainty.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Based on the provided data, the outlook for Lockheed Martin (LMT) is cautiously pessimistic, although there are mixed signals.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   Persistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD).
    *   Frequently negative Alpha.
    *   Downward price trend (SMA analysis).
    *   Negative change in relative divergence.
    *   Institutional selling (Marshall Wace news).
    *   *Extremely* negative expected return (questionable, but needs investigation).
*   **Potentially Positive Factors:**
    *   Medium MRI score.
    *   RSI approaching oversold.
    *   Neutral analyst consensus with upside potential based on target prices.
    *   Recent "Rises Higher Than Market" news (needs further investigation).
    *   The Hybrid Signal gives "Buy" recommendation.

**Conclusion:**

While the MRI suggests a moderate investment, and the hybrid signal suggests a "Buy," the *substantial* underperformance, negative divergence trends, and questionable expected return data suggest caution. The neutral analyst consensus and upside potential reflected in the target prices are encouraging, but the negative factors outweigh these.

**Recommendation:**

Hold/Neutral, or a *very* small speculative buy, only if you believe in a turnaround. Any investment should be made with caution and a clear understanding of the risks. The very low "expected return" value should be investigated to determine if it is the result of flawed data or calculations. Further research is recommended, particularly regarding the "Rises Higher Than Market" news and the details of the analyst predictions. It would be wise to examine the LMT stock evaluation report to review any specific warnings and positive signals. Be aware that past performance is not indicative of future results.
