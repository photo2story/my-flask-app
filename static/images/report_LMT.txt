**7. Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin currently shows mixed signals. While the company demonstrates consistent profitability and has occasionally exceeded earnings expectations, its recent price performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but the negative PPO and downward price trends suggest a bearish momentum. The lack of a clear positive trend in revenue, equity, and ROE, coupled with a 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500, indicates a high-risk investment.  A thorough review of the recent market outlook and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into news beyond the provided data is strongly recommended.


**8. Recommendation:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is warranted.  The underperformance against the market, negative technical indicators, and the lack of a strong, consistent upward trend in key financial metrics all weigh against a strong buy recommendation. Further research into recent news, analyst sentiment, and the broader macroeconomic environment is strongly recommended before making an investment decision.
