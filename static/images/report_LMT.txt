**0. Summary Statistics:**

LMT's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While recent earnings have been strong, valuation metrics and short-term technical indicators suggest caution.  Long-term prospects remain tied to defense spending, presenting both opportunities and risks.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 91.19%

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO). While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others show significant negative alpha and substantial maximum drawdown (MDD).  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows steady growth.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $458.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $459.35

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent slight increase in price from the previous close (Last-market) is not significant enough to change the bearish sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 31.42 (Suggests oversold conditions, but should be interpreted cautiously in conjunction with other indicators)
* **PPO:** -0.5976 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Deviation Change:** -9.1% (Indicates recent short-term decline)
* **Expected Return:** -30.6% (This indicates a significant negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment period.  This should be viewed in the context of the risk tolerance of the individual investor.)
* **Price Change:** The slight price increase of $0.76 does not suggest a significant rebound.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | EPS Surprise |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-01-28 | 7.67 | 6.62 | 1.05 |
| 2024-10-22 | 6.8 | 6.5 | 0.30 |

| 2024-01-23 | 7.88 | 7.26 | 0.62 |

Lockheed Martin has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters.  This suggests strong financial performance. However, future earnings are subject to various factors including geopolitical events and government budgets.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.62B      | 3.71%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.10B      | 12.38%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $18.12B      | 11.75%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $17.20B      | 11.59%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $18.87B      | 12.16%        |

Revenue shows some variability. Profit margins show a significant drop in Q4 2024.  Further investigation into the reasons for this fluctuation is warranted.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $6.33       | 8.32    |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.20       | 22.54   |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.17       | 26.57   |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.65       | 23.23   |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.83       | 27.30   |

Equity and ROE show fluctuation.  The decrease in Q4 2024 is a concern, requiring deeper analysis to understand the underlying causes.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT's recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations. However, its performance relative to the S&P 500 is significantly lagging.  Short-term technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  While the company's strong fundamentals and consistent earnings beats are positive signs,  the considerable underperformance against the market, the significant negative expected return, and the volatility in profitability and equity metrics warrant caution.  A more in-depth analysis of the Q4 2024 financial results and a longer-term perspective on the impact of geopolitical factors are needed for a more comprehensive investment decision.  The -30.6% expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term is a serious consideration.  Any investment decision should be made after careful consideration of individual risk tolerance and diversification strategy.
