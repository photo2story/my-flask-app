**6) Overall Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin's recent performance presents a mixed picture. While earnings have consistently beaten expectations and the company shows positive alpha in several periods, its cumulative return lags the S&P 500 considerably.  Technical indicators point towards a bearish trend, and the most recent financial data reveals decreased profit margins and ROE. The -18.3% expected return further underscores the potential for underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Further analysis, considering geopolitical factors and long-term industry trends, is needed before making any investment decisions.  The consistent EPS beats are positive but need to be considered in the context of the overall market performance and declining financial indicators.
