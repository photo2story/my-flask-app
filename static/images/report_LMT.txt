## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Analysis

**Executive Summary:** Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT), a global security and aerospace company, has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly over the reviewed period. While it shows periods of strong growth, recent performance is weak, indicated by low RSI, negative PPO, and a considerably negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.  The company's recent earnings have generally exceeded expectations, but a lack of readily available revenue and gross profit data hinders a complete financial picture.  The stock's current price is below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

LMT's cumulative return (52.67%) is substantially lower than the S&P 500's (121.84%). The provided data shows a significant divergence (-69.2%), placing it at the 0th percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market.  While periods of high CAGR are observed (e.g., 2015-2017, 2017-2019), significant negative returns and high maximum drawdowns (MDD) are also present.  The consistently high Beta (generally above 0.5, indicating high volatility and correlation with the market) underscores the risk associated with LMT, but the inconsistent Alpha values (ranging from -0.14 to 0.8) suggest uncertain outperformance.  The fluctuation in market capitalization (Cap(B)) further indicates the influence of market conditions.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 45.0% | 2.5% | 16.0% | 0.0 | 62.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 4.0% | 14.0% | -14.0% | 0.1 | 52.6 |
| 2017-2019  | 39.0% | 14.0% | 9.0% | 0.8 | 80.2 |
| 2018-2020  | -18.0% | 14.0% | -45.0% | 0.4 | 75.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 16.0% | 12.5% | -55.0% | 0.3 | 77.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 11.0% | 12.5% | 2.0% | 0.3 | 108.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 42.0% | 8.3% | 18.0% | 0.3 | 104.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 26.0% | 8.3% | -7.0% | 0.3 | 114.4 |
| 2023-2025  | -22.0% | 8.3% | -85.0% | 0.2 | 99.6 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price (423.19) is below all three moving averages: 5-day (439.49), 20-day (463.88), and 60-day (487.66). This indicates a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (12.6):**  Extremely low, suggesting the stock is oversold. However, this alone does not guarantee an imminent rebound.
* **PPO (-0.61):** Negative, further confirming bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (-4.1):** Indicates a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (-210.6%):** A significantly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This is a major red flag.  This extremely negative projection requires further investigation into its calculation and underlying assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

LMT has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.

| 날짜       | EPS   | 예상 EPS | 차이    |
|------------|-------|---------|--------|
| 2025-01-28 | 7.67  | 6.63     | 1.04   |
| 2024-10-22 | 6.8   | 6.5      | 0.3    |
| 2024-07-23 | 6.85  | 6.46     | 0.39   |
| 2024-04-23 | 6.39  | 5.82     | 0.57   |
| 2024-01-23 | 7.88  | 7.26     | 0.62   |


While exceeding expectations is positive, it needs to be considered within the context of the overall market performance and the negative expected return.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a complete financial analysis. This missing information is crucial for assessing the company's overall financial health and growth potential.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

LMT's underperformance relative to the S&P 500, bearish technical indicators (low RSI, negative PPO, price below moving averages), and a drastically negative projected long-term return present a concerning picture. While the company has shown positive earnings surprises, the lack of crucial financial data and the significant negative expected return relative to the market raise significant concerns.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the extremely negative expected return projection and to obtain the missing financial information before making any investment decisions.  The high Beta also suggests that any market downturn would likely significantly impact LMT's performance.
