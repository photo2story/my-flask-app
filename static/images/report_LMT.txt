While positive alphas suggest outperformance in some periods (e.g., 2017-2019), negative alphas (e.g., 2018-2020, 2020-2022) indicate underperformance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LMT's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly. While it shows consistent positive earnings surprises, the substantial negative expected return (-59.6%) relative to the S&P 500 over the long term raises concerns.  The high beta indicates higher volatility than the market. The fluctuating ROE and profit margins suggest the need for further in-depth analysis to understand the underlying drivers.  Investors considering LMT should carefully weigh the potential for earnings growth against its inherent risks and consistently lower returns compared to the broader market.  More detailed financial statements and industry analysis would be necessary to provide a complete and conclusive investment recommendation.  The provided -59.6% expected return requires clarification on the methodology and underlying assumptions before it can be reliably considered.
