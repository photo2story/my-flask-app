* **5-Day Moving Average:** $444.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $457.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $457.61

The price is slightly below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price change of $0.31 represents a minor increase.

The technical indicators suggest a bearish sentiment. However, the recent positive relative divergence change indicates a short-term upward trend.

The relatively small price change does not indicate a significant event (no sudden jump or drop).

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

While Lockheed Martin has shown consistent earnings beats and a relatively stable financial position in some aspects, its overall performance significantly lags behind the S&P 500. The negative expected return and mixed technical indicators suggest caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the fluctuating profit margins and ROE, as well as a deeper analysis of the company's long-term growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data points to a potentially undervalued stock relative to market performance, but this needs to be weighed against other risks and market factors.
