## Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT), a global security and aerospace company, has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly over the analyzed period. While exhibiting periods of strong growth, its recent performance has lagged behind the market benchmark, showing a negative alpha and a relatively high beta.  Further analysis is required to determine the underlying reasons for this underperformance and assess future prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin (LMT) shows a cumulative return of 25.50%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 65.78%. This results in a current divergence of -40.3%, placing it at the 26.0th percentile of its historical range (min: -63.7%, max: 26.2%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 47.0% | 53.8% | 18.0% | 62.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 1.0% | 65.4% | -17.0% | 52.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 33.0% | 65.4% | 3.0% | 79.3 |
| 2018-2020  | -29.0% | 65.4% | -55.0% | 74.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 7.0% | 63.2% | -47.0% | 76.5 |
| 2020-2022  | -27.0% | 63.2% | 0.6 | 107.5 |
| 2021-2023  | 17.0% | 60.8% | 0.5 | 102.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 2.0% | 60.8% | 0.4 | 113.2 |
| 2023-2025  | -9.0% | 71.1% | 0.2 | 108.8 |

The high and fluctuating Beta indicates significant sensitivity to market movements.  The negative Alpha in several periods suggests underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $463.70
* **Previous Close:** $462.24
* **Change:** $0.32 (0.07%) - A small positive change.
* **5-day Moving Average:** $446.45
* **20-day Moving Average:** $451.07
* **60-day Moving Average:** $455.08

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend, though this needs further investigation.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 63.53 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.31 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -70.9% (This is a significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.  The methodology behind this calculation needs to be clarified.  This number requires serious scrutiny and likely represents a significant flaw in the analysis methodology.)

The small positive price change is not significant enough to classify as a sharp increase. The negative expected return deserves significant further investigation to determine its validity and underlying assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| 2025-01-28 | 7.67   | 6.62          | Beat       |
| 2024-10-22 | 6.80   | 6.50          | Beat       |
| 2024-07-23 | 6.85   | 6.46          | Beat       |
| 2024-04-23 | 6.39   | 5.82          | Beat       |
| 2024-01-23 | 7.88   | 7.26          | Beat       |

Lockheed Martin has consistently beaten EPS expectations in recent quarters. This is a positive sign for future performance.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.62B   | 3.71%         |

| 2023-12-31 | $18.87B   | 12.16%        |

Profit margins show variability, with a significant drop in Q4 2024.  Further investigation is needed to understand the factors driving this fluctuation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE     |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $6.33B   | 8.32%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.20B   | 22.54%  |

ROE also shows considerable fluctuation.  The relationship between revenue, profit margin, equity, and ROE needs further analysis.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Lockheed Martin's recent performance has lagged the S&P 500, despite consistent earnings beats.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity, and the inconsistent alpha suggests challenges in outperforming the market.  While the company shows strong revenue, the fluctuating profit margins and ROE raise concerns.  The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is highly questionable and requires thorough review of the methodology used to calculate this projection.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the drivers of profit margin and ROE volatility and a reassessment of the long-term return projection, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
