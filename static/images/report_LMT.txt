2025-12-30 - Analysis Report
Here's a breakdown of the Lockheed Martin (LMT) stock data provided, along with analysis:

**1. Return Rate Comparison (LMT vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Lockheed Martin Corp. is a global aerospace, defense, security, and advanced technologies company.
*   **LMT Cumulative Return:** 33.15%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 103.21%
*   **Divergence:** -70.2 (Relative Divergence: 8.6)

**Analysis:**

LMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period for which cumulative returns are calculated. The negative divergence of -70.2 indicates a substantial gap between LMT's return and the S&P 500's return. A relative divergence of 8.6 suggests the current divergence is near its worst historical point within the observed range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table Analysis:**

The table provides insights into LMT's risk-adjusted performance:

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, ranging from -26% to 44%, indicating volatile performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high drawdowns around 79%, suggesting significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Mostly negative, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark, except for the periods 2015-2017 and 2021-2023. The significantly negative Alpha values, especially from 2018 to 2021 and 2023-2025, are concerning.
*   **Beta:**  Variable. A positive Beta (e.g., 0.8 in 2019-2021) means LMT's price tends to move in the same direction as the market, while a negative Beta (e.g., -0.8 in 2017-2019) suggests an inverse relationship.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap):**  Large-cap stock, indicating a more established company.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 483.03
*   **Last-market Close:** 488.87
*   **5-day SMA:** 481.81
*   **20-day SMA:** 468.04
*   **60-day SMA:** 477.74

**Analysis:**

The current price is above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting short-term upward momentum. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, further supporting a potential upward trend.

**3. Indicators: RSI, PPO, MRI, Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 73.05 (Overbought)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.48 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (5 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -1.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -251.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The medium-risk recommendation suggests that the overall market conditions are considered moderate.
*   **RSI:** The high RSI value (73.05) indicates that the stock may be overbought and prone to a pullback.
*   **PPO:** The positive PPO suggests upward momentum, but it should be interpreted with caution in light of the overbought RSI.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  A "Buy 90%" signal with "Safe" rating seems counterintuitive, given the indicators. This suggests a potentially algorithm-driven recommendation that needs further scrutiny. The MRI of 0.80 associated with this signal indicates a medium level of risk, aligning with the overall MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative divergence change suggests a short-term downward trend compared to the comparison asset (S&P500, VOO).
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative Expected Return (-251.5%) is extremely concerning and a major red flag. It suggests the model predicts a very significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Pentagon Contract Expansion Opinions:** Positive sentiment related to potential contract expansions.
*   **Pentagon Contract Boosts, F-35 Scrutiny:** Mixed news, with contract boosts offset by scrutiny of the F-35 program.
*   **Will Lockheed Martin (LMT) Shares Rebound?** Reflects uncertainty about the stock's future performance.
*   **Evaluating LMT Stock's Actual Performance:** Suggests an in-depth look at the company's fundamentals and past results, potentially revealing underlying issues.
*   **Slocum Gordon & Co LLP Buys Shares:** Positive signal of institutional investment (but the amount is relatively small).
*   **KTOS vs. LMT:** Which Defense Stock Is Better at Innovation? Comparison suggests potential competitive pressures.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean:** 2.62 (~Hold)
*   **Target Price:** 523.95 (Avg)

**Analysis:**

Analysts have a consensus "Hold" rating with an average price target of 523.95, which is above the current market price, suggesting potential upside but with caution.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Lockheed Martin's stock performance is currently showing mixed signals. While recent price action suggests some upward momentum, the stock significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the longer term. The high RSI indicates that the stock may be overbought, and a pullback might be expected. The negative trend in recent divergence supports this. The extremely negative expected return should be seen as a serious cause of concern.

The news headlines present a mixed picture, with contract opportunities potentially balanced by program scrutiny and competitive pressures. The analyst consensus is a "Hold" rating, suggesting a neutral outlook. The hybrid signal indicates a 90% Buy but consider these signals carefully, as they might be algoritmically driven.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, a **Cautious** stance is recommended. While some indicators show short-term positive signs, the long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the high maximum drawdowns, and the extremely negative expected return are significant concerns. A deep dive into the company's fundamentals, the F-35 program issues, and the reasons behind the negative expected return is crucial before considering an investment in LMT. The current overbought condition suggests waiting for a potential pullback before making any decisions. Consider the analyst's consensus of "Hold."
