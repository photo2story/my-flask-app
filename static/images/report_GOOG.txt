## Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.  Its cumulative return of 225.26% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 37.39%. The difference in cumulative returns is 187.9 percentage points.  This places the stock at the 94.9th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence values.

**Table Analysis:** The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows strong performance, particularly in 2023-2025.  The Alpha consistently being 1.0 suggests consistent outperformance relative to the benchmark (though the benchmark itself isn't specified here beyond the S&P 500 context). The Beta is quite high (around 1.0), indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) has improved over time which is positive.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $196.71
* **Last Market Price:** $195.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $193.77
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $192.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $178.98

The price is currently trading above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 47.75 - This is near the neutral level (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.24 -  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.  This is at odds with the price being above moving averages.  Further investigation is warranted to reconcile this discrepancy.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +4.3 - Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 31.5% -  This represents a significant potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the projected return holds. The fact that the Last-Market price (195.38) is very close to the closing price suggests there wasn't a significant price jump or drop immediately after market close.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a generally upward trend in both revenue and EPS over the past five quarters.  Revenue growth is consistent. EPS growth shows some quarters with similar performance, but generally increasing as well.  No specific expectations or beats/misses against those expectations are provided, so a full analysis regarding these is impossible.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG shows strong historical performance significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  Recent price action suggests a positive short-term trend, although conflicting signals from the PPO require additional investigation.  Earnings indicate consistent growth, and the financial statements point to a strong and healthy financial position.  However, missing information on recent news, analyst opinions, and details concerning earnings expectations limits a more comprehensive analysis. The high Beta suggests significant volatility to anticipate.  The high expected return is enticing, but should be viewed with caution given the limitations of the information provided.  A thorough investigation of the discrepancy between the PPO and other indicators is required before drawing firm conclusions.
