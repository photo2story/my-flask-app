|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 2.14 | 88.27         |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent financial data indicates robust revenue growth and high profitability. While the RSI suggests potential short-term correction, the long-term outlook, supported by a high expected return, remains positive.  However, the duplicated data in the earnings report requires further investigation.  The relatively high beta suggests higher volatility compared to the market, which investors should consider.  Careful monitoring of the price action and key financial indicators is recommended.
