## Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.

The cumulative return of GOOG is 230.08%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.36%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 109.7%, placing it in the 91.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This suggests GOOG has substantially outperformed the market over the observed period.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant variability in yearly performance, ranging from a low of 5% to a high of 162%. This highlights the inherent risk associated with individual stock investments, even with strong overall performance. The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values in some years (e.g., 41.4%) further emphasizes this risk.  The consistently low Beta value (around 0.1) indicates low correlation with the overall market.  While the Alpha is consistently around 0.1 suggesting a modest outperformance, this needs further context in relation to the risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $199.63
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $195.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $194.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $182.90

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day averages indicates some consolidation, while the larger gap with the 60-day MA shows a more substantial recent move upwards. The last day's price shows a small increase ($1.05) compared to the previous closing price, indicating a minor upward trend which is further supported by the moving average analysis.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.80 –  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum.
* **PPO:** -0.146 – Negative value suggests bearish momentum in the short-term. This could contradict the positive price movement shown by moving averages.  Further investigation into the divergence is necessary.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +3.4 –  Indicates a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 17% – This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 with a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon assuming the current trajectory continues. This should be considered cautiously as it's based on past performance, which is not indicative of future results.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a generally upward trend in both EPS and revenue.  However, there is a duplication in the October 2024 data.  Assuming the duplicated entry is an error and using only one October 2024 data point, the sequential quarter-over-quarter growth in revenue has slowed down in recent periods.  While the EPS has increased, further analysis is required to understand the profitability drivers.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 2.14 | 88.27        |
| 2024-07-24 | 1.91 | 84.74        |
| 2024-04-26 | 1.91 | 80.54        |
| 2023-10-25 | 1.56 | 76.69        |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability tables show a consistent growth in revenue, although the growth rate appears to be slowing.  Profit margins remain relatively stable and high.  The equity and ROE (Return on Equity) also show a steady increase, indicating strong financial health.  It’s worth noting that a high profit margin is generally good but sustained profitability is more valuable for long-term evaluation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend, although some conflicting signals exist between moving averages and the PPO indicator.  The fundamental analysis shows healthy financials with consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, though growth rate appears to be slowing. The high expected return is optimistic and hinges on the assumption that the past outperformance will continue.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**  The high historical outperformance does not guarantee future success.
* **Risk assessment is crucial.**  While GOOG has shown impressive returns, it's essential to consider the inherent risks associated with individual stock investments. The historical MDD values highlight the potential for significant losses.
* **Diversification is essential.**  Investing in a single stock is inherently risky.  A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk.
* **Further analysis is recommended.**  This review is based on limited data.  Thorough due diligence, including a comprehensive evaluation of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future prospects, is necessary before making any investment decisions.
