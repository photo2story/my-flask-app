**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $161.47
* **Last Market Price:** $165.81 (increase of $1.86 from previous close)  This indicates a recent price jump, suggesting potential short-term volatility.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $155.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $155.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $171.54

The current price is below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend, despite the recent price increase.  The close proximity of the 5 and 20 day moving averages suggests a period of consolidation or sideways movement prior to the recent price jump.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.4053 suggests a medium level of risk.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.55, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.71, showing a positive momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** 0.6 (+), indicating short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return:** 85.7%  This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, but should be treated with caution as it's a forecast and not a guaranteed return.  The recent price jump of $1.86 contributes positively to this expected return but also implies short-term risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Recent financial data suggests healthy revenue and profit growth.  However, the relatively high expected return should be considered alongside the medium risk level indicated by the MRI. The recent price surge introduces short-term volatility.  A long-term investment approach might be suitable, considering the historical outperformance and positive long-term growth prospects suggested by the financials and expected return, but investors should carefully monitor market conditions and financial news for potential risks.  Clarification on the duplicate data entry in the earnings data is necessary for a more comprehensive analysis.
