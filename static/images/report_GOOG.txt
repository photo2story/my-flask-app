**0) Introduction & Key Figures:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.  The following analysis is based on provided data.

**Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (GOOG):** 89.34%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 78.93%
* **Return Difference (GOOG - VOO):** 10.41%
* **Relative Divergence:** 22.0% (Indicates GOOG's performance is in the 22nd percentile relative to its historical divergence from VOO.)


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

GOOG has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered, with a cumulative return exceeding VOO by 10.41%. The relative divergence indicates that this outperformance is relatively strong compared to its historical performance relative to the VOO.  

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals varying performance characteristics across different periods.  While positive Alpha values in several periods suggest outperformance, negative Alpha values also exist, indicating underperformance relative to the market during those times. The Beta generally stays above 0.7 which indicates higher volatility and market sensitivity compared to the market. The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent company growth.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $157.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $154.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $156.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $172.13

The price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $2.48 from the previous close indicates a small upward movement, potentially hinting at a short-term recovery from recent negative trends, but further observation is required.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 49.07 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.4375 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -1.0 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 90.0% (Significantly higher than VOO's projected return, implying potential for substantial outperformance over the long term.)

The recent price increase of $2.48, while notable, isn't substantial enough to be categorized as a "sharp rebound."  The combination of indicators points to a mixed outlook; while the long-term expected return is promising, short-term indicators suggest some caution.
