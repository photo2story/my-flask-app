**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products, including advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of GOOG is 226.03%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 119.94%.  The difference is 106.1%, placing it at the 88.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  This suggests a strong outperformance compared to the market benchmark.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, indicating a slightly positive excess return compared to the market (Beta approximately 0.1)  though this varies year to year.  The significant capital increase over the years supports this growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $197.18
* **5-day Moving Average:** $197.90
* **20-day Moving Average:** $195.58
* **60-day Moving Average:** $185.89

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downward trend, but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicating a potentially bullish longer-term trend.  The recent price change is a slight increase of $0.11, not significant enough to be considered a sharp jump.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.69  (Close to neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.26 (Slightly negative, suggesting a potential bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.4% (Indicates a recent slight decrease in relative performance.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 18.3% (Significantly higher than the implied return of holding the S&P 500 alone.)

The relatively neutral RSI and slightly negative PPO suggest the stock may be consolidating.  The negative relative divergence change suggests underperformance compared to the recent past.  The high expected return of 18.3% compared to the S&P 500 is a key positive point, if realized.
