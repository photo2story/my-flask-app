**7. Overall Assessment**

Alphabet (GOOG) shows a mixed picture. While long-term prospects appear strong (high expected return, solid revenue growth), the stock is currently overbought, and recent Alpha values suggest underperformance compared to its benchmark. Recent news suggests volatility and potentially significant events impacting the stock. It would be prudent to monitor news closely, and consider that the overbought RSI could signal a potential pullback. The high expected return over the long term is a positive sign for investors with a longer time horizon. Also, high MDD is caution sign for investors
