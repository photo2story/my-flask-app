GOOG exhibits strong long-term growth potential, consistently outperforming the S&P 500.  While short-term indicators (RSI, PPO, relative divergence) suggest some caution, the long-term prospects, supported by strong financial performance and a high expected return, make it a potentially attractive investment, particularly for long-term investors with a horizon of two years or more.  However, the data error in the earnings report needs clarification before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data point is crucial.  Finally, the relatively low beta provides some downside protection against broader market volatility.
