## Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.  The cumulative return of GOOG is 210.17%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.40%. The difference in cumulative returns is 89.8%, placing it at the 75.4th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong historical outperformance, though past performance does not guarantee future results.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance relative to the market (S&P 500) across different time periods.  While Alpha is consistently positive (around 0.1), indicating some degree of manager skill or factor exposure beyond simple market movements, the Beta values vary as well, suggesting varying levels of market correlation in different time periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $186.53 (Last Market: $194.01)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $177.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $174.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $170.04

The price is currently below the last market price, and is above all three moving averages, suggesting potential upward momentum, but the recent drop from the last market close should be considered.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.57 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 0.49 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +18.5% (Significant positive change indicating short-term upward trend.)

The 20-day relative strength change of +18.5% indicates a recent short-term upward trend. The significant drop from the last market close of $194.01 to the current closing price of $186.53 suggests a potential correction or temporary pullback.  However, this should be analyzed in conjunction with other market factors.  The expected return of 88.3% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a very ambitious projection and should be viewed cautiously.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, as evidenced by significantly higher cumulative returns.  Recent price action suggests some short-term volatility, but the stock is trading above its moving averages. Positive technical indicators like the PPO suggest bullish momentum.  Financial statements reveal healthy revenue growth, high profit margins, and a strong balance sheet.  However, the high expected return projection should be considered speculative and requires external validation.  Crucially, missing data points (market outlook, analyst opinions, specific news events) prevent a complete and nuanced analysis.  Further research is recommended before any investment decisions are made.
