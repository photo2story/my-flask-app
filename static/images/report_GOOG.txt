## Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products, including advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of GOOG is 222.78%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 106.3 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 88.6% indicates GOOG's performance is in the upper 88.6th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant variability, ranging from 5% to 160% depending on the period.  This highlights the volatility inherent in GOOG's stock performance.  The Alpha consistently around 0.1 suggests a small degree of outperformance compared to the market benchmark (Beta around 0.1, indicating low correlation with the overall market), but the high CAGR in certain periods is what drives the large cumulative return difference.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) fluctuates significantly, indicating periods of considerable risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $195.21
* **Last Market Price:** $195.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $193.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $194.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $181.83

The stock price is slightly above its short-term moving averages (5 and 20-day) and significantly above its longer-term moving average (60-day), suggesting a recent upward trend.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price is negligible.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.97 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO:** -0.37 – A negative PPO indicates that the 12-day EMA is below the 26-day EMA, suggesting bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Divergence:** -1.1 – This short-term decline in relative strength could indicate a potential pullback.

The Expected Return of 18.3% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant positive outlook,  but the RSI and PPO suggest caution. The current price of $195.66 does not signal a rapid surge or decline; rather, the indicators point to a period of consolidation or potential minor correction given the negative relative divergence.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a consistent upward trend in both EPS and revenue, although there seems to be a duplicate entry for 2024-10-30.  Assuming the duplicate is an error and using only the unique data points,  revenue growth is robust, and EPS is also growing, demonstrating strong financial performance.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 2.14 | 88.27         |
| 2024-07-24 | 1.91 | 84.74         |
| 2024-04-26 | 1.91 | 80.54         |
| 2023-10-25 | 1.56 | 76.69         |


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability show consistent growth and strong performance. Revenue is increasing steadily, and profit margins remain high and relatively stable.  Equity is growing, indicating a healthy financial position, and the Return on Equity (ROE) is positive, albeit with some minor fluctuations.  This suggests efficient use of capital and consistent profitability.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, exhibiting strong revenue and earnings growth.  However, the recent technical indicators (PPO and relative strength divergence) suggest potential near-term downside risk.  The high CAGR in some periods needs to be balanced against the MDD figures, highlighting the volatility associated with the stock.  While the long-term outlook, supported by the projected 18.3% expected return, remains positive, investors should consider the inherent volatility and potential for short-term corrections.  The consistent growth in financials presents a strong foundation, but short-term market movements must be considered before making investment decisions.
