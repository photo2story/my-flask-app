## Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG), a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.  The analysis incorporates cumulative return, comparative performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), performance indicators, recent earnings, and financial information.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **Ticker:** GOOG (Alphabet Inc. Class C)
* **Cumulative Return (GOOG):** 124.67%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 89.83%
* **Return Difference:** 34.8% (GOOG outperformed VOO by 34.8 percentage points).
* **Relative Divergence:** 33.5% (This indicates GOOG's performance is in the upper 33.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO, based on its historical maximum and minimum divergence).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals varying performance across different timeframes.  While periods like 2019-2021 showcased exceptional growth (149% CAGR), other periods (e.g., 2020-2022 and 2022-2024) experienced negative or significantly lower returns. Note that the market capitalization (Cap(B)) increased steadily over the periods.  The alpha consistently above 0 suggests outperformance relative to the benchmark, although this varies significantly year to year.  The Beta exceeding 1 in the last two periods shows higher volatility than the overall market.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $156.23
* **Last Market Price:** $158.29 (Slight increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $163.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $167.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $182.97

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent price increase of $1.32 reflects a minor uptick, but it doesn't necessarily counteract the overall downward trend indicated by the moving averages.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 39.07 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.22 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -16.5% (Indicates a recent weakening of GOOG's performance relative to the benchmark).
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 97.1% (This represents a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years), but it should be interpreted cautiously).  The recent price increase is a minor event and does not necessarily indicate a reversal of the overall downward trend.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6) Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, as evidenced by its substantially higher cumulative return.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term bearish trend. While earnings and financial indicators reflect strong profitability and growth, the relatively high Beta indicates significant market volatility.  The high expected return projection should be viewed with caution, especially considering recent performance and market uncertainty.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is crucial for a complete analysis.  The current price is near oversold territory (based on RSI), but this does not guarantee an immediate reversal.  A comprehensive investment decision requires a thorough consideration of all factors, including risk tolerance and long-term investment goals.
