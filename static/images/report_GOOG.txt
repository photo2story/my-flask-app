**6. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered. However, recent price action and technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest a potential short-term bearish trend.

The absence of crucial financial data limits a more detailed evaluation.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and acquisition of complete financial statements are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return should be considered alongside the inherent risks of investing in the stock market.
