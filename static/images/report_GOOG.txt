*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
    | 2015-2017  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 629.5 |
    | 2016-2018  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 623.0 |

    | 2018-2020  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 1053.8 |
    | 2019-2021  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 1740.6 |
    | 2020-2022  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 1067.5 |
    | 2021-2023  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 1695.5 |

    | 2023-2025  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0 | 1944.8 |

    *Analysis:*

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  All CAGR and MDD values are 0.0%, this likely indicates that the data is either incomplete or normalized for comparison, meaning the performance is being measured relative to a starting point.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently 0.0, meaning there is no outperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500 implicitly, given Beta).
    *   **Beta:** Beta is consistently 1.0 (except for the last year 2023-2025). A Beta of 1.0 indicates that GOOG's price tends to move in line with the market (S&P 500).  Beta value of 0 for the last year is unusual, suggesting that GOOG's price movements were uncorrelated with the market during that period. This could be due to specific company events.
    *   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):**  The market capitalization shows a general trend of growth over the periods.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 160.88999938964844
*   **Last Market Data:** price = 160.89, previousClose = 159.58, change = 0.82
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 156.68
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 159.148
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 164.3769

    *Analysis:* The current price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the price is still below the 60-day moving average, which could indicate that the longer-term trend is still uncertain or potentially downward.  The positive change from the previous close indicates recent positive momentum.

**3. Market Risk and Expected Return Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.0 (Low Risk range: 0.45~0.35, Medium Risk range: 0.4~0.3, High Risk range: 0.5~0.65)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 54.13513960019824
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.0594
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

    *Analysis:*

    *   **MRI:**  A MRI of 0.0 indicates very low market risk, which is an outlier given the provided ranges for low, medium, and high risk.  This may be a data error or represent an extremely unusual market condition.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 54.14 is neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO (0.0594) indicates that the shorter-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term moving average, supporting the short-term upward trend seen in the price action.
    *   **Recent Relative Deviation Change:** The negative value indicates a recent underperformance relative to the benchmark.
    *   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0.0% suggests no anticipated outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. This could be based on current valuation and growth expectations.
    *   **Rapid Price Change:** The significant change from the previous close `{'price': 160.89, 'previousClose': 159.58, 'change': 0.82}` shows there are immediate market fluctuations. You should consider these market volatilities when proceeding.

*Analysis:*

**7. Overall Analysis**

Based on the provided data, here's a summary:

*   **Performance:**  The initial performance comparison data (cumulative returns, alpha, beta) requires review because the returns are listed as 0.0 and the betas seem unusual.
*   **Recent Price Action:** The stock shows a short-term upward trend, but the longer-term trend is less clear. The positive change from the previous close indicates recent positive momentum.
*   **Market Risk and Expected Return:**  The MRI value of 0.0 is highly suspect and requires further investigation. RSI is neutral.  The PPO signals some short-term momentum.  The negative recent relative deviation suggests some underperformance.
*   **News:**  Recent news indicates that GOOG is experiencing volatility and is subject to market-moving events that require close monitoring.
*   **Earnings:**  Earnings per share and revenue have generally been increasing, indicating healthy growth. The duplicate data entry needs correction to get a correct picture.
*   **Financials:** Revenue, equity, and ROE have been generally increasing over the last five quarters, suggesting solid financial performance.  Profit margins are high and stable.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The analysis presents a mixed picture. The core business seems to be performing well, with increasing revenue, earnings, and ROE. However, recent news suggests volatility and market-moving events. The market risk indicators show some anomalies.  Investors should carefully monitor the news and company announcements, and confirm the earnings data before making any decisions. The initial performance metrics (cumulative returns, alpha, beta) should be validated.
