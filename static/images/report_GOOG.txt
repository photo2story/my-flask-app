GOOG's stock performance has been better than the S&P 500, but recent price movements show a short-term bearish trend.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, and the PPO indicates negative price momentum. While recent earnings met expectations, slowing EPS growth is a concern.   Investors should consider both the potential for a rebound due to oversold conditions and the potential for continued weakness due to the slowing EPS growth and bearish technical indicators.
