* **5-Day Moving Average:** $199.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $195.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $184.67

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent price change of +$1.16 represents a small, positive daily movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 68.10 –  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback might occur.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.05 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.3 – Shows a short-term upward trend.

The recent price change, while positive, isn't dramatic enough to be considered a sharp upturn. The expected return of 16.3% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is significantly positive, suggesting potential for outperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a consistent upward trend in both EPS (Earnings Per Share) and Revenue. However, there's a duplicate entry for Oct 30, 2024. Assuming the duplicate is an error and removing it, the trend is clear: steadily increasing revenue and EPS, indicating a healthy financial state.


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability tables show consistent growth in revenue and relatively stable profit margins. The capital and profitability table indicates a steady increase in equity and a relatively stable, though slightly fluctuating, ROE (Return on Equity). This overall picture suggests financial health and steady growth.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  While recent technical indicators show some overbought conditions, the long-term outlook appears positive, supported by consistently growing revenue and earnings.  However, investors should be aware of the potential for short-term volatility and the possibility of corrections given the current RSI levels. The significantly positive expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term makes it an attractive investment for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance.  Further analysis, considering macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape, is recommended before making investment decisions.
