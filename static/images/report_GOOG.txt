## Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** GOOG
* **Company:** Alphabet Inc. Class C, a multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products.
* **Cumulative Return (GOOG):** 207.22%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 121.84%
* **Return Difference (GOOG - VOO):** 85.4%
* **Relative Divergence:** 70.8% (Indicates GOOG's performance is significantly above the S&P 500, relative to historical volatility)


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

GOOG has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return exceeding VOO by 85.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 70.8% highlights the extent of this outperformance relative to its historical variability.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods.  While Alpha (excess return relative to the market) is generally positive, indicating outperformance, Beta (volatility relative to the market) is significantly high in some periods suggesting increased risk.  It's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods, like 2019-2021 (151%),  is noteworthy but  needs to be considered in conjunction with the corresponding Maximum Drawdown (MDD).  High CAGR with high MDD suggests periods of strong gains followed by significant drawdowns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $186.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $187.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $195.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $189.31

The price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short-term. The recent price change (-$0.54) indicates a minor decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 42.77 (Below 50, suggesting bearish sentiment)
* **PPO:** -0.95 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -3.0% (Short-term downtrend)

The RSI and PPO values, along with the negative relative divergence, all point towards a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price drop of -$0.54 is not significant enough to warrant classifying it as a "sharp decline." The expected return of 29.8% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 represents a considerable potential for outperformance. However, this is a projection and carries inherent uncertainty.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has historically outperformed the S&P 500,  demonstrated by high cumulative returns and a strong relative divergence. While recent price action shows a slight downward trend supported by bearish technical indicators,  the company's financial statements present a picture of strong revenue growth, high profit margins, and increasing equity. The long-term expected return is significantly positive compared to the S&P 500.  However, investors should carefully consider the higher Beta (risk) associated with GOOG and the fluctuations in past performance before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and macroeconomic factors, is recommended before forming a comprehensive investment strategy.
