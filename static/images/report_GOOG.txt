**6) Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has shown strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a significant positive alpha.  While recent price action indicates a potential short-term correction (below moving averages, negative PPO), the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by consistent revenue growth, high profit margins, and a strong ROE.  The expected return of 64.6% over the long term (2+ years) is substantial compared to the S&P 500.  However, the recent price drop and relatively low RSI suggest caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price decrease and clarification of the duplicate earnings data point are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests a potentially attractive long-term investment, but short-term volatility should be anticipated.
