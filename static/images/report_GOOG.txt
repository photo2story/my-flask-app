While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of strong growth, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) highlights significant risk.  Alpha fluctuates, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  Beta generally suggests a relatively high correlation to the broader market, although it varies year-to-year.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: 161.47
* 5-day Moving Average: 155.26
* 20-day Moving Average: 155.90
* 60-day Moving Average: 171.54

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* RSI: 57.55 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* PPO: 0.709 (Positive; indicates bullish momentum)
* Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days): 0.6 (+) (Short-term upward trend)
* Expected Return (2+ years): 85.7% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 projected)

The technical indicators suggest a moderately bullish outlook, but the medium risk level from the MRI warrants caution.  The high expected return reflects the historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but this is not a guaranteed future outcome.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-04-25 | 2.84 | 90.23 B$      |
| 2024-10-30 | 2.14 | 88.27 B$      |
| 2024-07-24 | 1.91 | 84.74 B$      |
| 2024-04-26 | 1.91 | 80.54 B$      |
| 2025-04-25 | 1.91 | 80.54 B$      | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Revenue shows a generally upward trend, although there's a notable jump in the most recent quarter (2025-04-25).  EPS also increased significantly in that period.  The duplicated entry needs clarification.


**5) Financial Information:**

No comprehensive financial information ('Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit') was provided.  A more detailed financial statement analysis is needed for a complete assessment.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating strong growth potential. However, significant periods of drawdown highlight substantial risk.  Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, though positive momentum indicators remain present.  The high projected long-term return is promising, but future performance is uncertain and dependent on various market factors and company-specific developments.  Missing comprehensive financial data limits a more detailed evaluation. Further investigation into the duplicated data entry and acquisition of comprehensive financial statements is crucial for a more robust investment decision.
