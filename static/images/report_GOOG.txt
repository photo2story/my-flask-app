* **20-Day Moving Average:** $188.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $190.41

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in recent price movements. The last market day showed a significant price drop of -2.57% (-$2.57). This price drop likely contributes to the low RSI value.

The extremely low RSI and negative PPO values, coupled with the negative relative divergence change and recent price drop suggest a bearish trend.  However, the significant expected long-term return warrants consideration. The sharp recent price drop (-2.57%) signifies a potential short-term correction or reaction to market events.

However, the recent price drop warrants careful consideration and monitoring of market conditions.  The discrepancies in the earnings data require clarification to ensure accuracy in the analysis.  Investors should further investigate the reasons behind the recent price decline before making any investment decisions.
