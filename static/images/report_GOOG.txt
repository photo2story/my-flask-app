*   **High MDD & Fluctuating Alpha**: Historical volatility and periods of underperformance should be considered.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Short-term:** Given the overbought conditions and potential negative news, it might be prudent to wait for a pullback before initiating a new position.
*   **Long-term:** The strong expected return and positive analyst consensus suggest that GOOG could be a worthwhile long-term investment, particularly if implemented with a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate risk.  However, investors should closely monitor the regulatory environment and the company's ability to maintain its competitive edge.
