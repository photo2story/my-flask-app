## Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) Investment Report

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.

The cumulative return for GOOG is 226.64%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 108.3%, placing it at the 90.2nd percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -4.5% and a maximum of 120.5%).  This suggests a strong historical outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The provided CAGR data further highlights periods of significant growth, though also shows volatility with periods of lower or negative returns relative to the S&P 500.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $197.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $194.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $193.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $182.35

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages suggests a recent acceleration in the upward trend. The larger gap between the 20-day and 60-day averages indicates a more significant upward price movement in the recent months compared to the longer-term trend.  The recent price change of $1.62 from the previous close shows a small but positive daily movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.69 - This indicates a relatively neutral market condition, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO:** -0.28 - A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum, potentially contradicting the price's recent positive movement. This divergence warrants further investigation.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.8 -  Indicates a short-term upward trend, consistent with the price action.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 17.5% - This represents a significant outperformance expectation against the S&P 500 over the long term.

Given the positive price change (`change: 1.615`), this is interpreted as a small upward movement rather than a significant jump.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a consistent increase in both EPS and revenue over the past few quarters, though the most recent quarter shows a slight decrease compared to the preceding quarter.  However, the revenue is still significantly higher than the past year.  Further analysis is needed to determine if these figures are in line with market expectations and if the slight dip in EPS indicates a trend.  The repetition of the 2023-10-25 data point in the table requires clarification.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG demonstrates a strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. Recent price action suggests a positive trend, although some technical indicators present a conflicting signal.  The company's financial health is excellent, with consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  However, a minor dip in EPS in the most recent quarter and a discrepancy in the earnings data warrant further scrutiny.  The projected long-term outperformance is significant, but investors should monitor the conflicting signals from technical indicators and the recent earnings reports. Further investigation into the factors driving the recent performance is recommended before making any investment decisions.  It's crucial to consider diversifying the portfolio and not relying solely on the analysis of a single stock.
