**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.  Its cumulative return of 214.17% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 129.75%. The difference in cumulative returns is 84.4%, placing it at the 60.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This suggests GOOG has historically outperformed the S&P 500 more often than not, but not consistently at such a high margin.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $171.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $175.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $168.30

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 5-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The price is however above the 60-day moving average.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.39):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.44):** Indicates a bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:**  `nan` indicates a lack of data or calculation for the 20-day relative strength divergence.  The provided note suggests a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (135.3%):** This represents a significant long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500, based on projected returns.  This projection should be viewed cautiously.  A 173.01 closing price doesn't indicate a dramatic jump or fall, given the other metrics.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent revenue growth across the quarters, albeit with slight fluctuations. EPS also shows a positive trend, with a slight dip in Q4 2023 and a jump in Q4 2024.  We lack information to compare against expectations.  However, based solely on the reported figures:

* **Revenue Growth:**  Steady growth is observed, although the rate of growth varies between quarters.
* **EPS Trends:**  Generally increasing, but the Q4 2023 and Q4 2024 values are the same and require more context for complete analysis.
* **Beats/Misses:** Cannot be determined without comparison to expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows a consistent upward trend, while profit margins remain relatively stable around 58%, with a slight dip in Q4 2023.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity is steadily increasing, reflecting a growing company. ROE is generally trending upward, although it saw a minor dip in Q2 2024.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent earnings news (within the last two days) or market outlook/analyst opinions are provided in the prompt.  Therefore, this section cannot be completed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong long-term growth trend.  However, recent indicators (RSI, PPO, and moving averages) point to a potential short-term bearish trend.  While revenue and earnings show a positive trend, the provided data is insufficient to analyze the recent performance against expectations.  The projected long-term expected return is high, but this should be treated as a high-level forecast.  Further research into recent news, analyst opinions, and specific market conditions is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The relatively low RSI suggests a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors, but a short-term decline is plausible.
