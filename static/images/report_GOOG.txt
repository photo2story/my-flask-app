## Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.

The cumulative return for GOOG is 235.04%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.09%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 113.95%. This places GOOG at the 94.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data (max: 120.5, min: -4.5).

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows considerable volatility in performance relative to the S&P 500, indicated by the fluctuating alpha and beta values.  While Alpha generally remains positive, suggesting outperformance, the Beta's fluctuation reflects sensitivity to market movements.  High CAGR years (e.g., 2019-2021) are followed by periods of lower or negative returns (e.g., 2020-2022), highlighting the risk associated with this stock despite its overall strong performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $202.63
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $198.51
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $196.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $186.39

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent price change of $2.76 (from the previous close) represents a significant daily increase, indicating a possible short-term upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 59.47 -  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, suggesting a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.10 -  Slightly negative, suggesting bearish momentum in the short-term.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +5.4 - Shows a short-term upward trend.

The recent price increase (2.76) is noticeable and contributes to the positive short-term momentum indicated by the relative divergence. The expected return of 15.5% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 suggests a strong potential for outperformance if the current trends hold.  However, this is just an estimate and the actual return could be significantly higher or lower.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a generally upward trend in both EPS and revenue, although there's some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.  Note that there's a duplicate entry for October 30, 2024; this should be clarified for a more accurate analysis.  The consistent growth in revenue suggests a healthy underlying business performance.  Further analysis of the specific business segments driving growth is needed for a comprehensive understanding.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Both revenue and profitability (profit margin) have been consistently strong and growing over the reported period.  The capital and profitability metrics (Equity and ROE) also display consistent growth. This financial health strengthens the view of the company's underlying strength.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has demonstrated strong long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While short-term indicators present a mixed picture, the overall financial health, consistent earnings growth, and substantial long-term expected return relative to the market suggest a positive outlook. However, the historical volatility highlights the inherent risk involved. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and long-term investment goals before making any investment decisions. The identified duplicate data entry in the earnings section should be corrected for a more accurate and complete analysis.  Further investigation into the different business segments (e.g., Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud) and competitive landscape would provide a more nuanced perspective.
