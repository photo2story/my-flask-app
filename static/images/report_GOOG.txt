**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.  GOOG's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by 80.2 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 66.7% suggests this outperformance is substantial compared to its historical range of outperformance/underperformance against the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows volatile performance over different periods, ranging from significant growth (e.g., 151% from 2019-2021) to minor decline (-3% from 2020-2022). Alpha values generally hover around 0-1, suggesting periods of outperformance relative to the market (Beta represents market sensitivity, and generally higher than 1).  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) are relatively manageable, except for the 2019-2021 period, indicating some periods of significant but recoverable volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $181.58
* **5-day Moving Average:** $185.60
* **20-day Moving Average:** $192.94
* **60-day Moving Average:** $189.96

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change (-$2.71) shows a significant drop from the previous closing price, reflecting a potentially bearish sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (22.62):** Deeply oversold, indicating a potential bounce.  However, this does not guarantee an upward trend.
* **PPO (-0.72):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change (-5.3%):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 33.7% above S&P 500. This suggests potential for significant outperformance over the long term (2+ years) if the long-term trend continues.  This high expected return must be viewed in the context of higher inherent risk in a stock that historically has a 17.3% maximum drawdown over 1-year periods.
