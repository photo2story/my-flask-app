**6) Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While recent price action indicates a short-term downturn, the company's financial health (high revenue, profit margins, and ROE) is robust.  The expected return of 105.8% over a long-term horizon is encouraging, but should be approached with caution.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is needed.  The relatively high beta suggests increased volatility, which should be considered alongside the potential high rewards.  Overall, GOOG appears to be a strong company with long-term growth potential, but investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance given the potential volatility.
