    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown remains high, indicating significant risk of loss during the observed periods.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing excess return relative to the market, varies.  Several periods show negative Alpha, indicating underperformance against expectations based on Beta. The most recent period (2023-2025) has very strong Alpha, indicating significant outperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is consistently around 0.8-0.9, implying that GOOG's price tends to move about 80-90% as much as the overall market. A Beta near 1 suggests that GOOG's volatility is similar to the market, but in these periods, it moves a little less than the overall market.
    *   **Cap:** Market Cap continually increased through the years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** $303.75
*   **Last Market Data:** Price increased by $1.91 from the previous close, signaling a small positive movement.

    *   20-day SMA: $313.2365
    *   60-day SMA: $280.2121
*   **Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is a short-term downtrend. The current price is also below the 5 and 20 day SMA, which further supports this downtrend. But the 60-day SMA is below the current price, indicating a longer-term uptrend. This suggests potential volatility, where the short-term trend is downwards, but the long-term trend is upwards.

*   **Expected Return:** 6.4%. This is the expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 if invested long-term (2+ years).
