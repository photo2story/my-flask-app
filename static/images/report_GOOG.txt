**1. Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a fluctuating Alpha and Beta over the years.  While Alpha generally indicates outperformance compared to the market, Beta measures volatility relative to the market.  Noteworthy is the significant jump in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) from 2019 to 2021 (115%), followed by a period of lower growth or even negative growth.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) in several periods highlights the inherent risk associated with the stock.  Market capitalization shows consistent growth throughout the period.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $154.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $160.14
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $177.04

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price increase of $2.59 from the previous close indicates a recent bounce or short-term recovery.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 41.5 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** 0.33 (Slightly positive momentum)

* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 77.8% (Significant outperformance compared to S&P 500 over 2+ years)

The high MRI suggests caution, while the RSI and PPO show mixed signals. The recent price increase, however, needs to be considered.  The positive expected return suggests potential for substantial long-term growth exceeding the S&P 500.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, with a strong long-term expected return.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn.  The high Market Risk Indicator warrants caution.  While the company exhibits strong financial fundamentals (revenue growth, high profit margins), the volatility and high risk should be carefully considered.  Long-term investors with a high risk tolerance might find GOOG attractive due to its growth potential, but short-term traders should exercise caution given the current technical indicators and recent price movements.  Further investigation into the duplicated data point in the earnings analysis is recommended.
