**0) Executive Summary:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG), the parent company of Google, is a technology giant dominating search, advertising, and cloud computing.  This report analyzes GOOG's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), examining its recent price movements, financial indicators, and earnings.  The analysis reveals a significant outperformance compared to the benchmark, albeit with increased volatility recently.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

* **GOOG Cumulative Return:** 110.28%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 71.02%
* **Return Difference:** 39.26% (GOOG outperformed VOO by 39.26%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 37.7% (This indicates GOOG's performance is in the upper 37.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range.)

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent Alpha and Beta values across different periods.  While Alpha generally indicates outperformance, the fluctuating Beta suggests varying levels of market sensitivity.  For example, the high Alpha in 2019-2021 coincides with a significant market upswing. The recent negative Alpha values suggest underperformance compared to the market in recent quarters. The increase in Beta in the last two years is also noteworthy. This variation requires further investigation into the specific market conditions during these periods.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $147.74
* **Previous Close:** $152.63
* **Change:** -$3.2 (a -2.1% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $154.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $163.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $180.31

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The recent price drop indicates a potential short-term correction or a sustained bearish phase.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk according to the provided scale)
* **RSI:** 30.04 (Approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound)
* **PPO:** -0.65 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.3% (Suggests short-term upward momentum, despite current price decline, but this needs to be viewed in the context of the long-term trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** 73.8% (This indicates significant outperformance of S&P 500 expected over the long term, but this is highly uncertain and should not be taken as a guaranteed return.)

The price change of -$3.2 represents a significant daily drop, but it is insufficient to characterize as a "crash" without further context.  More data is needed to determine if this is a temporary fluctuation or the beginning of a prolonged decline.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows steady revenue growth, although the growth rate appears to be slowing down in recent quarters. EPS remains relatively stable.  Further analysis is needed to evaluate profitability trends and identify any potential concerns.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong cumulative return. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction or increased volatility.  While financial indicators like revenue and profit margins show strength, technical indicators (RSI, PPO, MRI) point towards a bearish short-term outlook. The high expected return is promising for long-term investors, but significant risk is present based on the MRI.  Further investigation into the causes of recent price drops and a more thorough evaluation of the fluctuating Alpha and Beta values are needed before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data point in the earnings report necessitates clarification from the data source.
