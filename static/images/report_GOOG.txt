* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 89.66%
* **Performance Gap:** 64.8%
* **Relative Performance:** 63.15% (Current position relative to historical performance gap range)

This indicates that GOOG has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. However, it's important to note that relative performance indicates its position within its historical performance range, not necessarily a guarantee of future outperformance.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** 165.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 164.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 175.41

GOOG's recent price movements show a slight downward trend, as the 5-day and 20-day moving averages are below the closing price. The 60-day moving average, however, is above the closing price, indicating a potential upward trend in the longer term.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-Day):** -12.58 (Short-term bearish signal)

The RSI suggests that GOOG is in a neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold. The positive PPO value indicates a potential bullish trend. The negative delta_previous_relative_divergence suggests a short-term bearish trend. However, the expected return of 40.44% could indicate a potential for future growth.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue        |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2024-07-24 | 1.91  | 84.74 B$       |
| 2024-04-26 | 1.91  | 80.54 B$       |

| 2023-07-26 | 1.45  | 74.60 B$       |

GOOG's most recent earnings report (2024-07-24) showed an EPS of 1.91, which is above the consensus estimate of 1.85. Revenue also beat expectations, coming in at 84.74 B$ compared to the estimated 84.20 B$. This indicates strong performance, potentially reflecting continued growth and expansion in their core business. However, future performance and market conditions could impact future earnings and growth potential.

**5. Summary:**

GOOG has displayed a strong track record of outperforming the S&P 500, with a significant performance gap.  Recent price movements indicate a short-term bearish trend, but the long-term trend may be positive. Technical indicators point to a mixed outlook, with potential for both growth and decline. Despite the short-term bearish signal, GOOG's strong recent earnings and beating expectations point to continued growth and a positive outlook.
