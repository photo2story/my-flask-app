**6. Overall Analysis:**

GOOG has shown strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the given period, although this outperformance has not been consistent.  Current indicators suggest a short-term downtrend, with the price below its moving averages.  However, the company exhibits strong financial health, with increasing revenue, high profit margins, and growing equity.  The high expected return (85.1%) warrants further investigation into the methodology used to arrive at this figure.  The high MDD across all periods underscores the risk associated with the stock.  Further analysis involving other relevant factors like valuation metrics and future growth prospects is recommended before making investment decisions.  The duplicate data points in the earnings analysis require correction.
