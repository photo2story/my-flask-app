## Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) Stock Review

**0. Overview:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products, including online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

GOOG's cumulative return (88.97%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (57.94%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 31.0%, placing it at the 37th percentile of the historical range (max: 91.3%, min: -4.4%). This suggests that GOOG has exhibited above-average performance relative to the broader market, though not consistently in the top percentile.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods.  While Alpha is mostly positive, indicating outperformance, Beta values fluctuate, suggesting sensitivity to overall market movements changes over time.  It's crucial to note that CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) are important metrics to consider alongside Alpha and Beta for a complete picture of risk and return. The high CAGR in 2019-2021 shows a significant increase in returns, but this is balanced by a relatively high MDD value, indicating periods of substantial losses. Recent years show lower CAGR and moderate MDD suggesting stabilization of returns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $150.37
* **Last Market Price:** $150.3984 (+$0.78 change from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $153.696
* **20-day Moving Average:** $162.443
* **60-day Moving Average:** $179.5623

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downtrend. The slight positive change in the last market price might signal a minor price bounce, but the overall trend seems bearish in the short-term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)  -  Suggests a relatively high level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 36.60  -  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a short-term bounce.
* **PPO:** -0.66  - Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +6.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 59.2% (Long-term, 2+ years, vs. S&P 500)


The positive price change of $0.78 does not suggest a significant *sharp* rebound or decline. It's important to note that the expected return is contingent on various factors and should be considered with caution.  The high MRI highlights the risks involved.

**6. Overall Summary:**

GOOG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500,  with a consistently high profit margin and growing revenue. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn. While long-term prospects seem positive given the projected return and financial health, the high market risk indicator (MRI) and the bearish technical indicators (PPO, current price vs. moving averages) warrant caution. Investors should carefully consider the inherent risks associated with a high-growth tech stock before making any investment decisions. The recent earnings show consistent revenue growth but some EPS volatility.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is recommended.
