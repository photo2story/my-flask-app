**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $192.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $195.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $194.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $180.38

The price is currently below its short-term moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.  However, it is above the 60-day moving average, suggesting longer-term support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.59 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.46 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +2.0 (Indicates recent short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 18.5% above S&P 500.  This is a significant outperformance prediction.

The current price of $192.29 does not reflect a dramatic recent price movement (either up or down).  The combination of indicators suggests a relatively neutral to slightly bearish outlook in the short term, but the long-term outlook, based on the expected return, is positive.  The high expected return needs further justification to understand its accuracy.

EPS also shows a general upward trend, though there's a slight dip in the most recent quarter compared to the preceding one.
