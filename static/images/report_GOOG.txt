## Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.  The cumulative return of GOOG (222.78%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (116.43%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 106.3 percentage points.  This places GOOG at the 88.6th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on a range of -4.5% to 120.5%.  The Alpha of 106% and Beta of 0.1 (2015-2025) indicates strong outperformance relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $195.21
* **Last Market Price:** $195.17
* **5-day Moving Average:** $193.74
* **20-day Moving Average:** $194.01
* **60-day Moving Average:** $181.83

The price is slightly above its recent moving averages, suggesting a relatively stable, but potentially slightly upward trending price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.97 (Slightly below neutral; not oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.37 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -1.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 18.3% (Outperformance relative to S&P 500)

Given the slightly bearish technical indicators and the recent -1.1% relative divergence, the current price of $195.17 doesn't indicate a significant immediate price movement (neither a sharp uptrend nor a sharp downturn).  The expected return of 18.3% suggests a potential for significant outperformance over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).
