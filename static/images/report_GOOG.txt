**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.  Its cumulative return (211.82%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (128.86%) by 83.0 percentage points. This places GOOG at the 59.2nd percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on a range of -3.3% to 142.5%.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistently high beta values (above 1.3), indicating higher volatility than the market. Alpha values fluctuate but generally show positive outperformance against the market benchmark.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in several periods further supports this superior performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $170.82 (Last market: $170.90)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $169.34

* **60-day Moving Average:** $167.36

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 5-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.  The slight difference between the last market price and the closing price is negligible and doesn't signify a significant event.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 35.02 – This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.

* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -12.1% –  Shows a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 137.0% – This implies significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, assuming consistent past performance.

Given the RSI and PPO indicators along with the negative relative divergence, the current price suggests a potentially oversold situation, but caution is warranted due to negative momentum.  The significant expected return suggests long-term investment potential.
