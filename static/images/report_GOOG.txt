**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.

GOOG significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the review period, boasting a cumulative return of 92.25% compared to VOO's 66.69%.  The difference of 25.55% highlights GOOG's superior performance. The relative divergence of 31.3% suggests that this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta data show fluctuating performance over different periods.  While some periods show high CAGR and positive alpha (outperformance), others show lower returns and even negative alpha, demonstrating the inherent volatility of the tech sector.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth.  Note that a negative alpha does not necessarily indicate poor performance; it simply means underperformance relative to the market benchmark during that specific period.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $176.49

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent price increase of $1.3 (1.3%) from the previous close indicates a slight upward movement, but further observation is needed to confirm a trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (40.74):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (0.62):** A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum, but a declining PPO could be anticipated if the current price trend continues.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-6.6%):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585, classified as High Risk based on provided thresholds.  Caution is warranted.
* **Expected Return:** A projected 75.9% excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon suggests significant potential, but this is an estimate and carries inherent uncertainty.
