*   **Table Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** Solana has shown exceptional Compounded Annual Growth Rate(CAGR) over the observed periods, with particularly high values from 2021 to 2025. This signifies strong annual returns on investment.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown(MDD) indicates significant volatility, with drawdowns around 80% in most periods, which means the investment's peak-to-trough decline has been substantial. The 2023-2025 period sees a slightly lower MDD.
    *   **Alpha:** The Alpha matches the CAGR exactly, showing the value added by the investment compared to the baseline. This suggests that the entire return is based on the intrinsic value or growth of Solana, as opposed to market-related factors.
    *   **Beta:** A Beta of 1.0 indicates that Solana's price is expected to move in line with the market, which contradicts the high Alpha figures, suggesting the market comparison is not well-suited.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization is growing significantly, indicating Solana's increasing financial size and influence.
