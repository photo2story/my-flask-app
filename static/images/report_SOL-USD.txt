Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the Solana (SOL-USD) data provided, incorporating the requested elements.

**0) Overview**

First the numbers, then the analysis.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** SOL-USD
*   **Company:** Solana - A high-performance, permissionless blockchain.
*   **Cumulative Return (SOL-USD):** 782.60%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 0.0%
*   **Divergence:** 775.3
*   **Divergence Range:** Min: -28.5, Max: 2954.5
*   **Relative Divergence:** 26.9

**Analysis:**

*   **Massive Outperformance:** Solana has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) based on cumulative return.
*   **Relative Divergence Context:** A relative divergence of 26.9 indicates that the current divergence is relatively low compared to its historical range. This suggests that while Solana has greatly outperformed the S&P 500, it is not currently at its peak outperformance level within the given dataset. It is positioned near the bottom 27% of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility Implied:** The wide range of divergence (-28.5 to 2954.5) highlights the high volatility associated with Solana compared to a broad market index like the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | 96.0%   | 80.8%   | 96.0%   | 1.0  | 5.2    |
| 2021-2023  | 1319.0% | 80.8%   | 1319.0% | 1.0  | 53.4   |
| 2022-2024  | 803.0%  | 80.8%   | 803.0%  | 1.0  | 99.6   |
| 2023-2025  | 416.0%  | 75.7%   | 416.0%  | 1.0  | 73.5   |

**Analysis:**

*   **High Growth:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is extremely high across all periods, especially from 2021-2023. This indicates very rapid growth in Solana's price.
*   **Significant Drawdown Risk:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high (around 80%), indicating substantial potential losses during downturns.  This is a critical risk factor.
*   **Alpha Dominance:**  The Alpha value is equal to the CAGR, and the Beta is 1.0 across the board. This signifies that Solana's performance is almost entirely driven by its own specific factors (Alpha) and moves largely in correlation with the broader market (Beta of 1.0), but the significant Alpha component means its performance is overwhelmingly independent.
*   **Capitalization:** The Cap(B) value represents the market capitalization in billions. The increase over time shows the growth in Solana's market value.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 139.57
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 131.20, Previous Close: 139.02, Change: -5.62
*   **5-day SMA:** 135.76
*   **20-day SMA:** 136.43
*   **60-day SMA:** 171.52

**Analysis:**

*   **Recent Decline:** The negative change in the last market data and the fact that the 5-day and 20-day SMAs are below the 60-day SMA suggests a recent downward trend in Solana's price.
*   **Potential Resistance:** The 60-day SMA at 171.52 might act as a resistance level if the price attempts to recover.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 52.36 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 1.30 (Potentially Bullish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (8 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.5 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Price Change:** {'price': 131.1986, 'previousClose': 139.01633, 'change': -5.62} (Reflects Fluctuation - Sharp Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 3901.9% (High Expected Excess Return)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI Suggestion:** The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium investment recommendation, balancing risk and potential reward.
*   **Neutral RSI:** An RSI around 50 indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **Potentially Bullish PPO:** A positive PPO suggests that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, which can be a bullish signal, although further confirmation is needed.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (8 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01) indicates strong buy, however, should be reevaluated in a volatile market.
*   **Divergence and Price Action Conflict:** The negative relative divergence change over the last 20 days, coupled with the recent price decline, signals short-term bearish momentum. The large negative change in the last market price reinforces this.
*   **High Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return (3901.9%) is optimistic, but it needs to be considered in light of the high volatility and risk profile of Solana.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Volatility and Price Swings:** Other articles mention price drops and potential rebounds, highlighting the volatile nature of Solana.
