## SOL-USD Analysis Report (Unknown Company)

**Company Overview:** Unknown Company (SOL-USD) is an asset represented in the cryptocurrency market, as the provided data indicates it is traded against USD.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Cumulative Return:**
    *   SOL-USD: 3117.12%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO): 0.0%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Range: Max 8255.5, Min -24.9, Current 3232.1
    *   Relative Divergence: 39.3
    *   **Analysis:** SOL-USD has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. However, the "Relative Divergence" of 39.3 indicates that while positive, its performance is in the lower end of its historical range relative to VOO. This doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad investment, but it suggests that it's not currently performing at its peak relative to the benchmark.

    *   **CAGR:** Extremely high Compound Annual Growth Rates across all periods, indicating significant growth potential (and associated risk).
    *   **MDD:**  High Maximum Drawdown (72.4%-76.5%) signifies substantial volatility and potential for large losses.
    *   **Alpha:** The very high alpha values indicates significant outperformance versus the market. The returns are probably not due to overall market growth, and are because of this ticker.
    *   **Beta:** A beta of 1.0 suggests the asset's price moves in line with the market, but the high alpha indicates significant outperformance beyond market movements.
    *   **Cap(B):** The capitalization is growing, indicating an increasing market presence.
