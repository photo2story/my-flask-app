Okay, here's the analysis of SOL-USD, presented in English with key numbers first, followed by an interpretation of the data you've provided.

## SOL-USD Analysis (Unknown Company)

**Company Overview:** Unknown Company operating in the cryptocurrency space, as SOL-USD represents the price of Solana against the US Dollar.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **SOL-USD Cumulative Return:** 1326.15%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 0.0%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** 1326.2
*   **Relative Divergence:** 45.4 (meaning the current divergence is in the 45.4th percentile of its historical range)

**Key Takeaway:** SOL-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but the Relative Divergence suggests this outperformance is not at its historical peak, sitting near the middle of its historical band.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|----------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | 96.0%    | 80.8%   | 96.0%    | 1.0  | 5.8    |
| 2021-2023  | 1319.0%  | 80.8%   | 1319.0%  | 1.0  | 58.9   |
| 2022-2024  | 803.0%   | 80.8%   | 803.0%   | 1.0  | 109.9  |
| 2023-2025  | 960.0%   | 75.7%   | 960.0%   | 1.0  | 120.3  |

*   **CAGR:** Extremely high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) across all periods, indicating substantial growth, especially in 2021-2023
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD), highlighting significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha equals CAGR, suggesting all returns are excess returns (likely due to comparison against a 0% benchmark in your data).
*   **Beta:** Beta of 1.0 indicates the asset's volatility is similar to the market (likely a quirk of your calculation, as crypto is often more volatile).
*   **Cap(B):** Increasing market capitalization over time.

**Key Takeaway:**  The analysis points to high-growth and high-risk characteristics with potential for significant excess returns (alpha). The high MDD should be carefully considered.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 207.20
*   **Last-Market:** Price: 232.08, Previous Close: 221.68, Change: 4.69
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 207.96
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 226.09
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 202.27

**Key Takeaway:** The price is currently below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a possible longer-term uptrend. The 'Last-Market' data showing a significant price increase and positive change from the previous close suggests a potential rebound is underway.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 36.55 (Approaching oversold territory, typically below 30)
*   **PPO:** -1.86 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 3.4 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1674.9% (Significant outperformance vs. S&P 500 expected over a 2+ year investment horizon)

**Key Takeaway:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation. However, the RSI approaching oversold and negative PPO suggest caution in the short-term. The Hybrid Signal is bullish, recommending full investment. The recent increase in relative divergence aligns with potential short-term improvements. The expected return is extraordinarily high, but should be taken with a grain of salt due to the inherent volatility of SOL-USD.

**5. Overall Analysis**

SOL-USD presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.  Its historical performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500, but with considerable volatility.

The recent news isn't directly relevant, but overall positive market sentiment could be supportive.

The extraordinarily high expected return should be viewed cautiously, given the inherent risks in the cryptocurrency market.
