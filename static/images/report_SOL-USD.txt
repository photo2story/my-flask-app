    | Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha     | Beta    | Cap(B)  |
    | ---------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
    | 2020-2022  | 96.0%    | 80.8%    | 96.0%     | 1.0     | 5.7     |

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR is very high across all periods, indicating substantial growth, though it's decreasing in the most recent period (2023-2025).
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently high (around 80%), reflecting the inherent volatility of Solana.  This means investors experienced significant drops from peak to trough during these periods.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is equivalent to CAGR, which represents the excess return compared to the benchmark.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is consistently 1.0, indicating that Solana's price moves in line with the overall market (though the high alpha suggests it's generating much more return than the market alone).
    *   **Cap(B):** This value is likely related to market capitalization.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Analysis:** The 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are all above the current price (117.82). This suggests a recent downward trend, as the price has fallen below its average levels over these periods. The SMAs are ordered 5-day < 20-day < 60-day which is another indicator of a downtrend. The last market data confirms this with a price decrease.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** A value of 0.7 puts Solana in the "Medium Investment" category. This suggests the model considers the risk/reward profile to be moderately attractive.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 25.23 indicates that Solana is currently *oversold*.  Oversold conditions can sometimes precede a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -0.3532 indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, supporting the downtrend analysis.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying 100% of cash. This suggests a bullish outlook, potentially based on the oversold conditions (RSI) and the expectation of a rebound. The signal incorporates the medium MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative divergence change (-3.3) confirms a recent short-term decline in performance relative to its comparison.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return (4996.1%) is a strong indicator of future return compared to S\&P 500.

However, others express concern ("Is SOL USD Dead?", "Solana (SOL) Price Below $200").  The recent headlines are more negative, reflecting the recent price decline.
    Recent headlines indicate the price is falling, even though ETH and XRP is rising.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:**  (No data provided)  Without analyst consensus or target price information, it's impossible to gauge professional sentiment beyond the provided news headlines.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Solana has historically delivered extraordinary returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the provided data suggests a recent downturn.  The price is below its key moving averages, the RSI indicates oversold conditions, and the recent divergence change is negative. News sentiment has also turned more cautious.

Despite the current negative signals, the Market Risk Indicator (MRI) still suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation and the AI still recommends a "Buy" strategy. The high expected return is also a positive sign, suggesting significant potential upside if held long-term.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Volatility:** Solana is clearly a volatile asset, as evidenced by the high MDD. Investors should be prepared for significant price swings.
*   **Long-Term vs. Short-Term:** The data suggests that while the short-term trend is downward, long-term prospects remain potentially positive, according to the Hybrid Signal's investment recommendation and the high expected return.
*   **News and Sentiment:** Pay close attention to news headlines and market sentiment, as they can significantly impact Solana's price. The recent negative news warrants caution.
*   **Missing Analyst Data:** The lack of analyst consensus/targets is a significant gap in the analysis.  Seeking out this information would provide a more complete picture.

**In summary:** Solana presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The recent price decline and negative news sentiment suggest caution in the short term. However, the long-term outlook, based on the high expected return and a potential rebound from oversold conditions, could still be attractive for risk-tolerant investors.
