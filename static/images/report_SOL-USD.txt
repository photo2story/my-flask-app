The provided data shows that SOL-USD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.

However, the high volatility and large swings in performance, as evidenced by the CAGR and MDD figures in the table below, need to be carefully considered.


| Year       | CAGR      | MDD       | Alpha    | Beta     | Cap(B)   |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 2020-2022  | 217.0%    | 56.6%     | 194.0%   | 0.0      |          |
| 2021-2023  | 2214.0%   | 56.6%     | 2190.0%  | 0.6      |          |
| 2022-2024  | -796.0%   | 56.6%     | -829.0%  | 0.6      |          |
| 2023-2025  | 1897.0%   | 39.0%     | 1839.0%  | 0.5      |          |

**Analysis of the Table:** The table shows extremely high volatility in SOL-USD's performance.  CAGR fluctuates wildly, demonstrating periods of massive gains and significant losses.  The high Alpha values suggest significant outperformance relative to the benchmark, but this is highly volatile and likely unsustainable. The Beta values, while increasing over time, are generally above 1. This shows that SOL-USD is considerably riskier than the S&P 500 (Beta of 1).  The extremely high Alpha values warrant further investigation; they are likely driven by the high volatility.  Missing capitalization data (Cap(B)) limits a full fundamental assessment.


**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 141.23
* **Last Market Price:** 140.62
* **Previous Close:** 168.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 165.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 184.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 205.55

The price has experienced a significant drop recently, trading considerably below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, signaling a bearish trend.  The large negative change from the previous close (-16.31) indicates a sharp decline.


**Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 17.40 – This extremely low RSI value suggests the stock is oversold and potentially nearing a bottom.  However, given the extreme volatility, this indicator should be interpreted cautiously.
* **PPO:** -1.89 – A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -9.1 – This shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 6442.3% – This extraordinarily high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  Such projections are highly unlikely to materialize.  The extremely high volatility inherent in the stock's past performance makes any long-term forecast highly unreliable.

**Conclusion:**

SOL-USD has shown extraordinary returns but with extreme volatility and risk. The sharp recent price drop is concerning.  While the oversold RSI might suggest a potential bounce, the high risk profile indicated by the Beta, MDD, and overall volatility makes investing in this stock extremely speculative. The extremely high expected return should be treated as unrealistic.   Further research is needed to understand the underlying factors driving the extreme price swings before any investment decision is made.  It's crucial to approach this investment with a high risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the inherent volatility.
