The lack of available financial information and the extreme volatility make it incredibly difficult to assess its intrinsic value and future prospects. The high projected return should be viewed skeptically due to the past volatility and lack of financial information.  **Investing in SOL-USD is extremely risky and should only be considered by investors with a very high risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the associated risks.**  Further investigation into the underlying business and access to more complete financial data are crucial before any investment decision.  The extreme performance deviations strongly suggest a highly speculative asset.
