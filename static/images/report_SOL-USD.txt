**3.  Market Risk Indicators & Outlook**

| Metric                                   | Value      | Interpretation                                      |
| :--------------------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Market Risk Indicator (MRI)              | 0.9       | High Investment Recommended                          |
| RSI                                      | 46.66       | Neutral (Neither overbought nor oversold)          |
| PPO                                      | 0.1878     | Positive (Price above Moving Average)                |
| Hybrid Signal                            | Buy 100%   | Very Safe (MRI: 0.90)                               |
| Recent (20-Day) Relative Divergence Change | 5.3 (+)    | Short-term Increase in Outperformance                  |
| Expected Return (%)                      | 1432.2     | Long-term (2+ years) potential outperformance vs. S&P 500 |

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" level of risk appetite, but remember to reconcile with your own risk tolerance.
*   The RSI is neutral, meaning the asset isn't currently overbought or oversold.
*   PPO is positive and RSI is not overbought, indicating possibility for further upside.
*   The "Buy 100%" hybrid signal, combined with a "Very Safe" designation and high MRI, may be a product of the model's parameters being heavily weighted towards the asset's growth potential and not as sensitive to downside risk.
*   **Recent Price Fluctuation:** The minor negative change `{'price': 228.45493, 'previousClose': 229.10426, 'change': -0.28}` is relatively small and doesn't warrant highlighting a significant short-term issue.
*   A change of 5.3 in the recent (20-day) relative divergence indicates that the asset's outperformance relative to the S&P 500 has increased in the short term.
