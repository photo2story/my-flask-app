*   **Beta:** A Beta of 1.0 indicates that SOL-USD's price movements are highly correlated with the overall market (VOO). This should be interpreted cautiously, as the significant outperformance despite a Beta of 1 suggests other factors are at play.

SOL-USD has demonstrated exceptional historical growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this has come with substantial volatility. Recent technical indicators suggest a mixed outlook: The RSI is approaching oversold levels, while the hybrid signal is indicating that the fund should liquidate their position. The provided news highlights ongoing volatility and significant events that could impact the stock's future performance.

**Recommendation:**

Given the high volatility, the recommendation to sell, the lower position of the relative divergence and the extreme outperformance in the past, this investment is very risky and investors should practice caution and potentially sell off their position, even though the MRI is indicating lower risk. It is crucial to conduct more research on SOL-USD's business model, recent announcements, and the specific factors driving its price movements to form a well-informed investment strategy.
