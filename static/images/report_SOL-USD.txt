## 2️⃣ Alpha/Beta Snapshot  

*(No table – plain bullet list of key metrics)*  

- **Period 2021‑2023**  
  - CAGR: **1319 %**  
  - MDD: **90 %**  
  - Alpha: **1318 %**  
  - Beta: **2.1**  
  - Cap(B): **57.3**  
- **Period 2022‑2024**  
  - CAGR: **803 %**  
  - MDD: **79.1 %**  
  - Alpha: **783 %**  
  - Beta: **2.0**  
  - Cap(B): **106.8**  
- **Period 2023‑2025**  
  - CAGR: **357 %**  
  - MDD: **63 %**  
  - Alpha: **295 %**  
  - Beta: **1.6**  
  - Cap(B): **70.3**  

**Quick take**  
- Solana’s CAGR and Alpha stay in the 3‑4x range of the broader market, but volatility (Beta > 2) and severe drawdowns (up to 90 %) suggest a very high‑risk, high‑reward play.  
- The decreasing MDD trend hints at a slight improvement in downside protection over the last year, yet the Beta remains above 1, meaning the stock tends to move more than the market.

- **Performance**: Solana’s cumulative return outstrips VOO by over **720 %**, but its *relative divergence* places it in the lower quartile of its own historical performance range.  
- **Risk Profile**: Beta > 2 and MDD up to 90 % confirm a very high‑risk play. MRI marks it as *medium risk*, suggesting caution.  
- **Technical Outlook**: Price above 20‑ and 60‑day SMAs, but slightly below the 5‑day SMA; RSI nearing overbought, yet PPO remains positive.  
- **Fundamental Edge**: Strong bullish analyst sentiment and recent rating upgrades support a long‑term upside of > 4 000 %.  
- **Caveat**: Expected return trend is deteriorating over the last week, and the relative divergence trend is worsening—watch for a potential pullback near key support levels (~$123–$125).  
- **Investment Call**: Consider a *partial allocation* (e.g., 10‑20 % of portfolio) if you have a high‑risk tolerance; otherwise, maintain a larger cash buffer and monitor key support/resistance zones closely.
