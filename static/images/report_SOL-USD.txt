The difference in accumulated returns is a staggering 3974.19%.  The relative divergence (33.6%) indicates that this outperformance is high compared to historical fluctuations between the two assets. However, it is crucial to consider the volatility shown in the CAGR and MDD data (explained further below).

**Company Overview:**  The provided information does not give a description of the company behind SOL-USD.  More research is needed to understand the nature of its business.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** 217.539
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 222.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 230.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 208.76

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend in the short-term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.79 (slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.26 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) – Short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 5515.8% – This represents a significant projected outperformance against the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  This exceptionally high figure requires careful scrutiny due to the extreme volatility already observed.  The 217.59 closing price (Last-market) doesn't indicate a sudden price spike or drop, although it’s near the recent lows, confirming the downward trend.

**4. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available for SOL-USD.  This lack of fundamental financial information significantly limits the analysis and makes relying solely on the high expected return extremely risky.

**5.  CAGR, MDD, Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show extreme volatility:

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | 217.0%  | 56.6%   | 0.0   | 5.0   |        |
| 2021-2023  | 2214.0% | 56.6%   | 0.0   | 51.0  |        |
| 2022-2024  | -253.0% | 56.6%   | 0.0   | 104.0 |        |

The extremely high CAGR values are counterbalanced by a substantial negative CAGR and a consistent Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 56.6%. The alpha of 0.0 suggests no outperformance relative to the benchmark after accounting for risk (beta), and the rapidly increasing beta indicates extremely high sensitivity to market movements.  This is extremely risky. The lack of capitalization data also hinders a complete financial analysis.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information regarding earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided.  This lack of information is crucial for a comprehensive analysis.


**7.  Overall Analysis:**

SOL-USD demonstrates exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by extreme volatility and a lack of fundamental financial data. The high CAGR figures are counterbalanced by a significant negative return in the most recent period.  The high beta indicates extreme risk.  The absence of crucial information like financial statements and recent news makes a robust and reliable conclusion impossible.  **Investing in SOL-USD based solely on the provided data is extremely risky and not recommended.** More research is critically needed into the company's business model, financial health, and market conditions before making any investment decisions.  The high projected returns should be viewed with extreme skepticism given the volatility and lack of financial information.
