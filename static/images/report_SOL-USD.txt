## SOL-USD Stock Report: A Preliminary Analysis

**Summary:** This report analyzes the performance of SOL-USD, an unknown company's stock, comparing its returns to the S&P 500 (VOO) and assessing its recent price movements and technical indicators.  The data suggests significant volatility and outperformance relative to the S&P 500, although substantial risk is apparent.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SOL-USD's cumulative return (4271.42%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (98.09%).  The difference (4173.3%) places it at the 90th percentile (35.3% relative percentile) of historical deviations from the S&P 500, based on the provided range (max: 11898.8, min: -38.5). This suggests exceptional performance relative to the market benchmark, however it's crucial to note the high volatility.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals extremely high volatility and inconsistent returns:


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | 217.0%   | 56.6%   | 194.0% | 0.0   | 4.5    |
| 2021-2023  | 2214.0%  | 56.6%   | 2190.0%| 0.6   | 48.4   |
| 2022-2024  | -796.0%  | 56.6%   | -829.0%| 0.6   | 86.1   |
| 2023-2025  | 3646.0%  | 33.0%   | 3586.0%| 0.5   | 105.4  |


The extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures are coupled with substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDD), highlighting the significant risk involved.  While Alpha is consistently high, suggesting substantial outperformance, the Beta values increase over time, indicating growing sensitivity to market movements. This extreme volatility should be a major concern for investors.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 231.6379
* **Last Market Price:** 216.4671 (a significant drop of -6.55 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 232.1769
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 231.1335
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 215.5261

The last market price shows a significant drop, below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a possible short-term bearish trend. The 60-day moving average is considerably lower, suggesting a longer-term downtrend is present. The recent price action indicates a potentially sharp downturn.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.57 (slightly above neutral; not indicating strong overbought or oversold conditions).
* **PPO:** -0.93 (negative, suggesting bearish momentum).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.4% (indicates a recent short-term decline).
* **Expected Return:** 3072.5% (This exceptionally high figure needs careful consideration given the high volatility observed.  It represents a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, but the realized return is highly uncertain.)

The significant price drop (Last Market data) combined with the negative PPO and slightly bearish 20-day relative divergence points towards a weakening trend. However, the RSI is not extremely bearish.  The extremely high expected return is likely based on past performance and does not guarantee future success. The high volatility inherent in the data heavily diminishes the reliability of the projected return.

**Conclusion:**

SOL-USD has demonstrated exceptionally high returns relative to the S&P 500, but this has come with substantial volatility and risk.  The recent price drop and technical indicators suggest a potential bearish short-term trend.  While the projected long-term return is exceptionally high, the reliability of this projection is severely undermined by the observed volatility. Any investment decision should consider these risks very carefully and should be based on a thorough due diligence process going far beyond the data provided here.
