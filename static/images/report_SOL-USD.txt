**Performance Analysis:**

The provided data reveals exceptionally high volatility and returns for SOL-USD compared to the S&P 500 (VOO). While SOL-USD shows a dramatically higher cumulative return, the substantial volatility (as evidenced by the massive swings in CAGR and the large negative CAGR in one period) warrants significant caution.  The high Beta values further illustrate the extreme sensitivity of SOL-USD's performance to broader market movements.  The substantial alpha values suggest significant outperformance during specific periods; however, the large negative CAGR in the 2022-2024 period highlights the significant downside risk associated with this investment.  The inconsistent performance across different years indicates significant risk and highlights the need for a thorough understanding of the underlying factors driving these fluctuations.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The table shows highly variable Alpha and Beta values, suggesting substantial performance swings and market sensitivity.  The extremely high Beta values (particularly in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024) suggest extreme sensitivity to market changes, meaning the stock will significantly outperform or underperform the market depending on market conditions.

* **Relative Divergence (20-day):**  A positive change of 1.1 suggests a recent short-term upward movement.

**Conclusion:**

SOL-USD exhibits exceptionally high volatility and return potential but also carries substantial risk. While the past performance has been remarkably high compared to the S&P 500, the extreme volatility and negative periods highlight the significant risk involved. Further research into the underlying company and the drivers of its price movements is crucial before considering any investment.  The high expected return should be viewed with a highly critical eye due to the associated risks.  A long-term investment strategy requires a very high risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the asset's inherent volatility.
