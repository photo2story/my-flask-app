**Analyst Opinions**

Analyst Consensus:

**Comprehensive Analysis**

Solana's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500, with a divergence of 771.00. The review stock's alpha is high, with a value of 1318.0% and 783.0% for the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods, respectively. However, the beta is also high, at 2.1 and 2.0, respectively. The market cap is significantly larger in the 2022-2024 period.

The recent stock price fluctuations show a decline in price, with the 20-day SMA and 60-day SMA lower than the current price. The RSI and PPO indicators are currently in the middle range, suggesting a stable market. However, the hybrid signal is still a "buy" signal, and the risk level is medium.

The recent news and significant events suggest a positive outlook for Solana, with predictions of a potential price increase. However, the analyst consensus is not available. 

Overall, Solana's high cumulative return and alpha values suggest a high-growth potential. However, the high beta and recent decline in price suggest a need for caution.
