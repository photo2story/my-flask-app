## Report: SOL-USD Investment Analysis

**Executive Summary:** SOL-USD, an unknown company, exhibits significantly higher cumulative returns (4201.73%) than the S&P 500 (VOO) at 98.12% over an unspecified period.  However, this outperformance is highly volatile, as evidenced by the extremely high beta and substantial drawdowns shown in the provided data.  While a high expected return (3162.3%) is projected, significant risk must be considered due to the company's volatility.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

The cumulative return of SOL-USD (4201.73%) vastly surpasses that of the S&P 500 (VOO) (98.12%).  The relative divergence from the S&P 500, while currently high at 4103.6, ranges from a minimum of -38.5 to a maximum of 11898.8, indicating extreme volatility. The relative divergence of 34.7% places the current performance in the upper percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The following table reveals considerable volatility and significant changes in alpha and beta across different time periods:

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | 217.0%    | 56.6% | 194.0% | 0.0 | 5.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 2214.0%   | 56.6% | 2190.0% | 0.6 | 53.4 |
| 2022-2024  | -796.0%   | 56.6% | -829.0% | 0.6 | 95.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 3577.0%   | 33.0% | 3516.0% | 0.5 | 114.5 |

The high beta values (ranging from 0.0 to 53.4, even reaching 95.0) show a strong correlation with market movements, but also indicates significant price swings amplifying market risk.  The fluctuating alpha suggests periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. The substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight the considerable risk associated with this investment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 227.94
* **Last Market Price:** 238.18
* **Previous Close:** 238.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 237.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 226.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 215.40

The price has recently decreased slightly (-0.30) from the previous close. The 5-day moving average suggests recent price stability above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, though a recent decline is noticeable. The 20-day and 60-day moving averages are below the current price, indicating an upward trend in the longer term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.69  (Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -0.71 (Suggests a weak bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.6% (Short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 3162.3% (Significantly higher than the S&P 500).

The relatively recent price decline (-0.30) is not significant enough to be considered a sharp drop. The high expected return is noteworthy, but the extreme volatility, as demonstrated by the historical data, must be heavily considered.


**Conclusion:**

SOL-USD presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The significantly higher returns compared to the S&P 500 are attractive, but the extreme volatility and high beta necessitate caution. The projected long-term expected return is impressive, but investors should be prepared for substantial price swings and potential large losses.  Further investigation into the underlying business of SOL-USD is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough risk assessment considering the investor's risk tolerance is paramount.
