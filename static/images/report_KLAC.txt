Given the mixed signals, a **cautious approach** is warranted.

*   **Potential Investors:**  Wait for a more favorable entry point. Monitor the stock's price action and technical indicators closely. A break above the 5-day or 20-day moving average could signal a renewed upward trend. Also, keep an eye on news related to export restrictions and the semiconductor industry in general.
