**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Woodward Inc. (WWD) is a manufacturer of energy control and energy systems products.  The provided data shows WWD slightly outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return difference is minimal (0.06%). However, analyzing the Alpha and Beta reveals a more complex picture:


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                    |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| 2015-2017  | 37.0% | 10.2% | 8.0%  | 0.1   | 4.3   | High alpha, low beta; strong outperformance |
| 2016-2018  | 31.0% | 67.0% | 13.0% | 0.1   | 4.2   | High alpha, low beta; strong outperformance |
| 2017-2019  | 52.0% | 67.0% | 23.0% | 0.4   | 6.8   | High alpha, moderate beta; strong outperformance |
| 2018-2020  | 55.0% | 81.8% | 29.0% | 0.8   | 7.0   | High alpha, moderate beta; strong outperformance |
| 2019-2021  | 0.0%  | 81.8% | -54.0%| 1.0   | 6.3   | Negative alpha, high beta; underperformance |
| 2020-2022  | -39.0%| 81.8% | -45.0%| 1.1   | 5.7   | Negative alpha, high beta; significant underperformance |
| 2021-2023  | -16.0%| 69.0% | -32.0%| 0.9   | 8.0   | Negative alpha, high beta; underperformance |
| 2022-2024  | 19.0% | 69.0% | 3.0%  | 0.9   | 9.9   | Low alpha, high beta; moderate performance |
| 2023-2025  | 18.0% | 81.4% | 4.0%  | 1.0   | 9.9   | Low alpha, high beta; moderate performance |

While initially showing strong alpha (outperformance relative to the market), recent years have seen consistently negative alpha, indicating underperformance compared to the benchmark.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $167.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $165.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $179.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $183.61

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent positive change (0.78) indicates a small rebound, but it's too early to confirm a trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)  This signals caution.
* **RSI:** 35.59 (Oversold territory) This suggests potential for a price bounce.
* **PPO:** -1.01 (Negative) This indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.1% (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -6.6%  This indicates a negative expected return compared to the market, at least in the near term.

The recent price increase of $0.78 is a minor change and doesn't represent a significant rebound.  Long-term (2+ years) investment may still potentially exceed S&P 500 returns based on historical alpha in certain periods, despite the negative expectation at this time.  However, the high risk MRI and recent underperformance warrant careful consideration.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     | Notes                               |
|------------|------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.47 | $0.77B      | Slightly lower than previous quarters |
| 2024-08-02 | 1.69 | $0.85B      | Higher than the first half of 2024 |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.61 | $0.84B      |                                    |
| 2024-02-02 | 1.50 | $0.79B      |                                    |
| 2025-02-04 | 1.50 | $0.79B      | Duplicate entry; needs clarification |


Earnings show some volatility but generally remain relatively stable, though there is a possible reporting error with a duplicated entry. Further investigation is needed to clarify this data inconsistency and assess the overall trend in earnings.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively consistent over the past year, but profit margins show some fluctuation, possibly indicating changes in cost structures or pricing strategies.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally increased, while ROE (Return on Equity) shows some variability.  This warrants further analysis to understand the drivers behind these fluctuations.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Woodward Inc. (WWD) presents a mixed picture. While it has historically shown periods of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (high alpha), recent performance has been underwhelming (negative alpha) and highly sensitive to market movements (high beta). Technical indicators currently suggest a bearish sentiment.  Recent earnings show some volatility, and further clarification is needed regarding a duplicated data entry. The current risk indicator is high.  Although long-term investment *could* potentially yield higher returns than the S&P 500 based on historical data showing intermittent periods of high alpha, the current market outlook and recent negative alpha signal caution.  Thorough due diligence and a careful assessment of risk tolerance are crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and a deeper dive into the drivers of profitability and ROE fluctuations are recommended.
