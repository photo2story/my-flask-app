## Woodward Inc. (WWD) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Woodward Inc. (WWD) shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the recent price action indicates a decline, the long-term performance warrants further investigation.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500:**

Woodward Inc. (WWD) is a global leader in energy and industrial markets, providing control solutions for aerospace and industrial applications.

* **WWD Cumulative Return:** 79.31%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 71.02%
* **Return Difference:** 8.29%
* **Relative Divergence:** 46.0% (This indicates WWD's performance is in the higher range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, but not necessarily 46% better).

The provided alpha and beta values show varying performance relative to the market (beta > 1 indicates higher volatility than the market).  Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance (positive alpha), but this needs more contextual data to interpret properly. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates, suggesting varying investor sentiment and market conditions over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $157.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $178.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $182.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $184.95

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend. The recent price drop of $10.07 (from $174.90) is substantial and points to potential negative market sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk) – indicating caution.
* **RSI:** 30.83 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce but not confirmation of a bullish reversal)
* **PPO:** -1.16 (Negative, confirming bearish trend)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -13.5% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** -0.2% (short term) –  This suggests a short-term negative outlook but does not reflect the long-term potential as suggested by the cumulative return and historical alpha. A long-term (2+ years) outlook considering regular investment would ideally incorporate volatility and factor in potential S&P 500 underperformance.

The significant recent price drop (-10.07) suggests a considerable negative event impacted the price,  requiring further investigation into company-specific news.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

WWD's long-term performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, showing periods of strong alpha. However, recent price action is bearish, indicated by the price being below key moving averages and negative technical indicators (RSI, PPO). The substantial recent price drop requires investigation into underlying causes. The financial data reveal some inconsistencies and fluctuations, requiring deeper analysis to understand the full picture.  Considering the current market risk indicator and the negative short-term outlook, a long-term investment strategy with a focus on risk management should be considered.  Further investigation into the company-specific news and the reason for the recent price drop is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data point for Q4 2025 further highlights the need for data verification before drawing conclusions.
