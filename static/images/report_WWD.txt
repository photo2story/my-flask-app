There's some inconsistency in the data (duplicate 2025-02-04 entry).  Assuming the first 2025-02-04 entry is accurate, earnings show some fluctuation but generally appear stable.  More detailed analysis requires additional information, such as comparing these figures to previous years.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Woodward Inc. (WWD) presents a mixed picture. While the company exhibits strong profitability and relatively stable revenue, its recent price action and technical indicators point towards a bearish short-term outlook.  The substantial historical volatility in alpha and beta underlines significant risk.  The provided -15.8% expected return is concerning and requires clarification of its calculation methodology.  A deeper dive into the company's fundamentals, future growth prospects, and a comparison with industry peers are necessary for a comprehensive assessment before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests a cautious approach.  Further research is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
