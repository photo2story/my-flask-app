* **Closing Price:** $174.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $183.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $183.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $185.29

The price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent -8.02 price drop is a considerable negative signal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.31 (approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.25 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.4% (short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 8.5% over the long term (2+ years).  This is a significant potential outperformance, but requires further validation.

The recent price drop warrants caution.  While RSI is approaching oversold levels, the negative PPO and relative divergence suggest a bearish trend. The 8.5% expected return is a positive note, but this is predicated on a long-term investment horizon and is contingent on the company meeting its projections.
