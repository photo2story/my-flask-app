**6. Overall Analysis:**

WWD has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a bearish trend, with the stock trading below its moving averages and showing negative momentum indicators.  The high beta indicates significant volatility.  While the recent drop might present a buying opportunity for long-term investors willing to tolerate high risk,  a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the recent price decline and the underlying business fundamentals is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data point and the causes of the recent price drop are recommended.  The high risk indicator and the negative expected return should be weighed carefully against the potential for long-term outperformance.
