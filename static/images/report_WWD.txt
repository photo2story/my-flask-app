The provided data shows varying Alpha and Beta values across different periods.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Woodward Inc. (WWD) shows a history of both strong performance and significant volatility. While its recent performance slightly outpaces the S&P 500, the high Beta and overbought RSI indicate considerable risk. The projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 warrants caution.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind the fluctuating Alpha, Beta, and quarterly earnings.  A more detailed analysis considering macroeconomic factors and industry trends is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The data presented suggests that WWD could be a suitable investment for a risk-tolerant investor with a long-term horizon, but only after a more in-depth due diligence process.
