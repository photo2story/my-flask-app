* **5-Day Moving Average:** $167.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $178.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $183.31

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.42 (from $167.64) is a small positive change but within the context of a larger downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk) – Indicates a high level of market volatility and potential risk.
* **RSI:** 36.65 – Suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a bounce back.  However, the MRI counteracts the potential bullish signal.
* **PPO:** -0.73 – A negative value points to bearish momentum, aligning with the moving average analysis.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.5 (Short-term upward trend). This is contradicted by the longer-term averages.
* **Expected Return:** -6.6% – This suggests a negative expected return relative to the market over a long-term investment period (2+ years).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data show some fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  There's no clear upward or downward trend. Further analysis, possibly including year-over-year comparisons and industry benchmarks, is needed for a definitive conclusion.

|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.47 | $0.77B        |
| 2024-08-02 | 1.69 | $0.85B        |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been relatively stable over the past year, hovering around $0.8B per quarter.  Profit margins are healthy and generally consistent, though showing a slight downward trend in the last two quarters. ROE (Return on Equity) also shows some fluctuation, but is generally within a healthy range.  Further investigation into the underlying causes of these fluctuations would be valuable.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

WWD has shown slightly better performance than the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative returns, but this is not significantly strong when considering its historical volatility relative to the market.  Technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) currently suggest a bearish sentiment, despite a recent price increase. The high MRI and negative expected return signal significant risk.  A thorough examination of the underlying reasons for recent earnings fluctuations, combined with a detailed industry comparison, is needed before making any investment decisions.  The high risk and the recent underperformance compared to the market raise significant concerns about the advisability of long-term investment, despite the relatively high profit margins.  Further research into the company's long-term growth prospects and competitive landscape is crucial.
