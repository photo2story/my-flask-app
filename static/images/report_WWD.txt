**6. Overall Analysis:**

Woodward Inc. exhibits mixed performance. While it has shown periods of strong growth and outperformance relative to the S&P 500, it has also experienced significant underperformance in other periods. Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, although a recent rebound is observed. Financial statements display relative stability in revenue but fluctuating profit margins and ROE. The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 warrants further investigation and consideration of risk tolerance. A comprehensive investment decision requires more in-depth analysis, including a thorough review of the company's future prospects, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors.  The provided data has inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) which must be resolved before drawing definitive conclusions.
