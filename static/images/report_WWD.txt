## Woodward Inc. (WWD) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Woodward Inc. (WWD) is a provider of energy control and other critical systems for aerospace and energy industries.  Over the past period, WWD has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a lower cumulative return. However, recent earnings show some positive signs, and its market risk profile appears relatively low. Further analysis is needed to determine a suitable investment strategy.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **WWD Cumulative Return:** 71.32%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 76.18%
* **Return Difference:** -4.86%
* **Relative Divergence:** 36.2% (This indicates that the current underperformance of WWD relative to VOO is in the 36.2nd percentile of historical divergence between the two assets.  It is not necessarily indicative of future performance.)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided Alpha and Beta values suggest that WWD has historically exhibited higher volatility (high Beta) than the market (Beta >1) and at times generated returns that exceeded the market (positive Alpha). However, the significant swings in Alpha and Beta over the years highlight the riskiness and inconsistency of its performance.  The high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) further emphasizes this risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $169.17
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $169.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $176.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $182.30

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent price change of -$0.24 indicates a minor decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.03 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.19 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.4 (Short-term upward movement relative to the benchmark)
* **Expected Return:** -17.9% (This is a significant negative expected return.  More information is needed to understand this figure's calculation and assumptions.)

Revenue is relatively stable, while profit margins have fluctuated, exhibiting some decline in recent quarters.  ROE shows some variability as well.  These data need to be interpreted within the context of industry trends and the company's specific business cycle.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Woodward Inc. shows mixed signals. While recent earnings reveal some positive aspects, the underperformance compared to the S&P 500,  along with negative expected returns and concerning historical volatility and drawdowns, raises significant concerns. The relatively low market risk indicator and approaching oversold RSI suggest a possibly oversold condition and potential for some short-term rebound. However, the long-term outlook requires further investigation, including a thorough examination of the company's strategy, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects.  The provided -17.9% expected return warrants particular scrutiny. The source and methodology behind this projection needs to be fully understood before making any investment decisions.  A more comprehensive analysis, considering factors beyond the data provided, is crucial for a sound investment evaluation.
