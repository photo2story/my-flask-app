## Woodward Inc. (WWD) Stock Review

**0. Overview:**

Woodward Inc. (WWD) is a global provider of energy control and automation solutions.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

WWD's cumulative return of 71.05% lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 76.31% over the unspecified period.  The difference is -5.3%, placing it at the 35.8th percentile of the historical range (-40.6% to 58%). This indicates WWD's performance is slightly below the S&P 500's but within a reasonable historical context.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows significant variation over the years.  While Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) is generally positive, Beta (volatility relative to the market) is consistently high (above 1), suggesting significant market risk.  The substantial swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlight periods of both strong growth and significant losses.  The substantial market capitalization suggests a well-established company, but the fluctuating figures raise concerns about consistency and stability.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $167.81
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $168.49 (slightly below)
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $174.18 (slightly below)
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $181.57 (significantly below)

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent increase of $1.57 from the previous close indicates a potential short-term rebound, but the overall trend appears bearish.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk) suggesting moderate risk.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.89, indicating the stock is potentially oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.1368, suggesting a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.3, indicating a recent short-term price increase.

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and a relatively low MRI, despite the recent price increase, suggests a cautious outlook. The expected return of -18.2% over the long-term, compared to the S&P 500, is a significant concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Woodward Inc. (WWD) shows a mixed picture.

Before investing, further investigation into the causes of the volatility and the potential for future growth is crucial. The data inconsistencies (repeated dates in earnings) also highlight a need for data verification.  A long-term investment strategy in WWD should be approached with caution, given its current performance and risk profile.
