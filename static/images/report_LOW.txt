## Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW) stock performance, financial health, and recent news, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO) index.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500:**

Lowe's Companies Inc. is a home improvement retailer operating a large network of stores.  The cumulative return for LOW is 169.35%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) returned 125.6%.  This represents a difference of 43.75%.  The relative divergence (43.75) places LOW in the 50.42nd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (max: 110.02, min: -23.64).  While outperforming the S&P 500, this outperformance is not extreme based on its historical context.


The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant variation year-over-year.  While several years show substantial outperformance, others reveal more modest gains or even underperformance relative to implied risk (Beta). Note that the Alpha and Beta values are based on a regression model comparing returns to the market benchmark;  in isolation, they're informative but should be considered along with other factors. The fluctuating beta suggests the market sensitivity of LOW's stock performance is not constant.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 44.5% | 13.5% | 6.1%  | 1.0   | 52.7   |
| 2016-2018  | 29.6% | 24.0% | -2.7% | 1.1   | 52.4   |
| 2017-2019  | 78.8% | 24.0% | 27.1% | 1.1   | 67.9   |
| 2018-2020  | 85.2% | 48.1% | 37.8% | 1.2   | 91.1   |
| 2019-2021  | 194.9% | 48.1% | 94.9% | 1.1   | 146.6  |
| 2020-2022  | 73.9% | 48.1% | 50.3% | 1.1   | 113.0  |
| 2021-2023  | 46.4% | 32.2% | 11.4% | 1.0   | 126.2  |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $259.26 (Last-market: $259.24)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $268.62
* **20-day Moving Average:** $267.30
* **60-day Moving Average:** $263.62

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it remains above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential longer-term support.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 47.98 –  Approaching oversold territory (below 50), but not decisively so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.21 – Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -11.54 – Indicates a recent decrease in the stock's relative strength against the benchmark.

Given the current price ($259.24) is not significantly different from the closing price, there's no evidence of a sharp uptrend or downtrend based solely on this minor price variation.  Further analysis is needed to confirm this.  The expectation of a 12.6% return over the long-term (2+ years) suggests potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500 but must be interpreted cautiously given inherent market volatility and uncertainties in any prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The recent earnings report shows some volatility.  While Q2 2024 earnings exceeded expectations ($4.18 vs. expected value unprovided), there is a decline compared to Q3 2023. The revenue is consistently high and reflects strong performance.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-08-29 | 4.18   | $23.59 B      |
| 2024-05-30 | 3.06   | $21.36 B      |
| 2023-11-29 | 3.07   | $20.47 B      |
| 2023-08-30 | 4.56   | $24.96 B      |
| 2024-08-29 | 4.56   | $24.96 B      |(duplicate entry) |

Further analysis, including analyst estimates and a comparison to previous quarters/years, is necessary to assess the earnings' long-term implications.


**6. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals a mixed picture. Profit margins are consistently healthy (32-34%), indicating strong profitability. However, equity is negative and ROE (Return on Equity) is volatile and generally negative, suggesting concerns about the company's financial structure or capital allocation strategies.  Further investigation into the components of equity and the reasons for negative ROE is crucial.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Lowe's (LOW) demonstrates a history of strong revenue generation and generally healthy profit margins. However, recent earnings show some volatility, and negative equity alongside fluctuating ROE raises some concerns about the financial health and long-term sustainability of the company. While LOW's past performance relative to the S&P 500 has been at times excellent, its current valuation and recent price action should be carefully considered along with technical indicators.  Further research into the reasons for negative equity and the full range of recent analyst assessments and market outlook is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return should be approached with caution; it's a forecast, not a guarantee.
