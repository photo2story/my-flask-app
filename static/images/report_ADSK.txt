Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that makes software products and services for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries.

Over the period analyzed, ADSK significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a 5.27% higher cumulative return.  The relative divergence of 16.1% indicates that ADSK's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this relative outperformance has fluctuated significantly, ranging from a maximum of 178.4% to a minimum of -27.9% historically.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis showcases considerable variation in performance year-over-year.  High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) years are interspersed with significant negative returns, indicating high volatility.  The increasing Alpha values in recent years (2021-2025) suggest increasing outperformance relative to the market, potentially explaining the recent higher cumulative returns.  The high Beta values consistently above 1 suggest high sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $274.21
* **Last Market Price:** $278.90 (Slight increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $282.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $296.74
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $298.04

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (26.87):** Indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO (-0.91):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-3.1%):** Shows a recent short-term decline.

The recent price change of $1.71 represents a slight uptick, but insufficient to signal a significant reversal of the downtrend indicated by the moving averages and PPO.  The provided 127.9% expected return is a significant projection; however, without the methodology for this calculation, its reliability cannot be assessed.  This figure should be treated with caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

There's a slight fluctuation in EPS and revenue, but a clear trend is not immediately apparent from this limited data.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

Equity is increasing, but ROE has decreased significantly. This warrants further investigation into potential causes.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has shown a strong cumulative return exceeding the S&P 500, driven by periods of high growth and high Alpha. However, significant volatility and high Beta highlight inherent risk. Recent price action suggests a potential downtrend, supported by technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages).  While the financial statements indicate healthy revenue growth and high profit margins, declining ROE requires further examination.  The high projected long-term return necessitates a thorough evaluation of its supporting assumptions.  A deep dive into the company's financial health and future prospects is needed before forming a conclusive investment opinion.  The provided data is insufficient for a fully comprehensive assessment.  More detailed financial statements, industry benchmarks and competitor analysis are necessary.
