Alpha, Beta Analysis:

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B)  |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|---------|

| 2018-2020  | 118.0% | 76.8%  | 95.0%   | 0.3    | 64.5    |
| 2019-2021  | 77.0%  | 76.8%  | 30.0%   | 0.5    | 59.4    |
| 2020-2022  | -72.0% | 82.6%  | -71.0%  | 0.7    | 39.5    |

| 2022-2024  | -52.0% | 82.6%  | -72.0%  | 1.0    | 62.4    |
| 2023-2025  | -11.0% | 81.2%  | -78.0%  | 1.4    | 63.4    |

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, with some periods of high growth (e.g., 2018-2020) followed by substantial declines (e.g., 2021-2023).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is largely positive in previous years indicating outperformance, but lately the negative Alpha values suggest that the stock is performing worse than expected given its risk. This is very concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta has increased over time, exceeding one, suggesting that ADSK is more volatile than the market and is becoming increasingly sensitive to market movements.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 300.10
*    **Last-market:** {'price': 297.64, 'previousClose': 300.925, 'change': -1.09}
*   **5-day SMA:** 302.97
*   **20-day SMA:** 298.89
*   **60-day SMA:** 306.85

**Analysis:** The current price (297.64) is below the 5-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) but above the 20-day SMA. This suggests a possible short-term downward trend but medium-term support. The negative change in the last market session indicates continuing downward pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence Change, Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 60.77
*   **PPO:** 0.23
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** 1.9 (+, indicating a short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -366.8

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI is around 61, indicating slightly bullish moment, but not overbought.
*   The PPO is a positive number, indicating that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which is generally a bullish sign.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends a strong buy, with 100% cash allocation. This is likely based on a safer investment strategy and the MRI.
*   Despite the recent short-term increase in relative divergence, the *expected return* is significantly *negative*, which is a major concern. This suggests very poor long-term prospects compared to the S&P 500, based on current models.
*  The news of {'price': 297.64, 'previousClose': 300.925, 'change': -1.09} reflects the recent fluctuation issue (decline).

**Analysis:** The news headlines present a mixed picture. Some sources suggest a buy recommendation, while others highlight choppiness, underperformance, and a faltering market. This underscores the current uncertainty surrounding ADSK.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.58)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 366.17, High: 460.00, Low: 275.00

**Analysis:** Despite the concerning performance data, analysts generally have a "Buy" recommendation and a target price significantly above the current price. This represents a substantial potential upside, *but* it contradicts the negative expected return calculated earlier and recent stock performance.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-11-26 | 1.61 | 1.85 B$     |

**Analysis:**  Both EPS (Earnings Per Share) and Revenue have shown an upward trend until the most recent announcement, indicating potential growth.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Consistent growth in revenue over the past five quarters is a positive sign.
*   **Profit Margin:** Extremely high and stable profit margins (above 90%) indicate a strong competitive advantage and pricing power.
*   **Equity:** Increasing equity suggests a strengthening balance sheet.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):**  ROE is fluctuating but generally healthy, although the significant drop in 2025-04-30 warrants further investigation. The most recent ROE of 11.86% is a positive sign.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Autodesk (ADSK) presents a complex and somewhat contradictory picture:

*   **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** ADSK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and its long-term expected return is extremely negative, suggesting fundamental issues not reflected in analyst consensus.
*   **Recent Price Action:** Recent price action is mixed, with short-term downward pressure but support at the 20-day SMA.
*   **Financials:** Strong revenue growth, extremely high profit margins, and healthy ROE are all positive indicators.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts are generally bullish, with a "Buy" consensus and high target prices. *This conflicts strongly with the calculated negative expected return.*
*   **News:** News headlines present a mixed view, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the stock.
*   **Risk:** High MDD and increasing Beta suggest the stock is volatile and sensitive to market movements. The increasing Beta is a cause for concern.

**Conclusion:**

The conflicting signals make a clear investment decision difficult.  The extremely negative *calculated expected return* should be a major red flag, despite the positive analyst ratings and strong financial data. The high maximum drawdown and beta figures point to potentially high risk. More investigation is needed to reconcile the positive analyst outlook with the negative expected return and historical underperformance. *Specifically, one needs to understand why the model predicts such a negative long-term return.* It would be prudent to be cautious and investigate the reasons behind the discrepancy before making any investment decisions.
