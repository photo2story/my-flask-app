*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 60.0% | 67.4% | 32.0% | 0.1 | 22.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 43.0% | 74.4% | 28.0% | 0.0 | 27.3 |
| 2017-2019  | 53.0% | 74.4% | 31.0% | 0.3 | 39.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 118.0% | 76.8% | 95.0% | 0.3 | 64.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 77.0% | 76.8% | 30.0% | 0.5 | 59.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -72.0% | 82.6% | -71.0% | 0.7 | 39.7 |
| 2021-2023  | -119.0% | 82.6% | -120.0% | 1.0 | 51.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -52.0% | 82.6% | -72.0% | 1.0 | 62.8 |
| 2023-2025  | -14.0% | 81.2% | -79.0% | 1.4 | 65.2 |

Autodesk shows high volatility (high MDD). A high positive alpha in some periods (e.g., 2018-2020) indicates outperformance relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark. However, recent negative alphas indicate underperformance. Beta generally indicates low correlation with the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   Current Price: 307.24
    *   Last Market Price: 306.23, Previous Close: 305.85, Change: 0.12
    *   5-day SMA: 305.85
    *   20-day SMA: 297.93
    *   60-day SMA: 308.06

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend.
    *   The 60-day SMA is slightly above the current price, suggesting it could act as resistance.
    *   The recent change of 0.12 is not particularly large, so it doesn't immediately signal a major fluctuation event.
    *   The 20-day SMA is significantly below the 60-day SMA, potentially indicating that the recent upward trend is a relatively short-term occurrence within a broader longer-term trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   MRI: 0.8 (Medium Investment)
    *   RSI: 55.63
    *   PPO: 0.74
    *   Recent Relative Divergence Change: -1.0 (Short-term decline)
    *   Expected Return: -627.8%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   MRI of 0.8 suggests a moderate level of risk and indicates a medium investment recommendation.
    *   RSI of 55.63 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
    *   PPO of 0.74 indicates that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, suggesting an upward trend, but not a strong signal.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence (-1.0) aligns with the underperformance compared to VOO and indicates a recent weakening.
    *   The extremely negative expected return (-627.8%) is highly concerning. This suggests that, based on the model, ADSK is predicted to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term. This number seems unusually low and could indicate a problem with the model or input data.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   Mixed sentiment: Some analysts see it as overvalued ("Too Expensive"), while others are raising price targets based on solid Q3 results.
    *   Institutional activity: Amundi decreased holdings, suggesting some institutions are becoming less bullish.
    *   Future outlook: Analyst predictions for 2028 are available (though we don't have the specifics).
    *   Collaboration updates: News on recent collaboration updates and the resulting share price movement suggests potentially positive internal developments within the company.
*   **Analysis:** The news is mixed. Positive Q3 results are encouraging, but concerns about valuation and institutional selling pressure are negative signals. The news on collaboration updates is a potential positive catalyst, suggesting internal improvements are underway.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   Consensus: Buy
    *   Mean Rating: 1.58 (~Buy)
    *   Average Target Price: $365.14

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating and believe the stock is undervalued, with an average target price significantly above the current price.
    *   However, it's important to consider the range of target prices ($275 - $430), which indicates some disagreement among analysts. Also, the lack of specific rating changes limits the usefulness of the rating change data.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Conflicting Signals:** ADSK presents a mixed picture. The company exhibits strong financial performance (high profit margins, increasing revenue, increasing equity) and is supported by analysts ("Buy" rating, price target upside). However, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the model suggests a very poor expected return, which is concerning.
*   **Potential Concerns:**
    *   **Overvaluation:** Some news headlines suggest the stock might be overvalued, which could explain the underperformance and negative expected return.
    *   **Model Accuracy:** The extremely negative expected return (-627.8%) is a red flag and warrants further investigation of the model's accuracy and input data. This may be an anomaly.
*   **Potential Upsides:**
    *   **Strong Financials:** The company's underlying financials are solid, with high profitability and revenue growth.
    *   **Analyst Support:** Analysts generally remain positive on the stock.
    *   **Collaboration Updates:** Internal improvements might be a catalyst for future growth.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** Due to the conflicting signals and particularly the concerning expected return, a cautious approach is advised. Before investing, one should:

    *   **Investigate the Expected Return:** Determine the source of the extremely negative expected return and whether it is accurate or an anomaly.
    *   **Valuation Analysis:** Conduct independent valuation analysis to assess whether the stock is truly overvalued.
    *   **Risk Tolerance:** Consider your personal risk tolerance, as ADSK has demonstrated significant volatility (high MDD values).
    *   **Monitor News:** Closely monitor news related to the company's financials, valuation, and any catalysts for growth.
