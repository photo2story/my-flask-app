**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that makes 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software.  Over the observed period, ADSK underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by 14.1%. While this shows underperformance,  the relative divergence of 12.3% suggests that this level of underperformance is not unusual within the historical context of ADSK's performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility, with periods of substantial outperformance followed by significant underperformance.  The high beta values (consistently above 1) suggest high sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha values indicate periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  The market cap fluctuates but remains substantial, indicating a large-cap stock.

* **Closing Price:** $271.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $262.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $259.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $274.21

The recent price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance at the $274 level. The recent price increase of $2.75 from the previous close signifies a notable upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 58.41 (Neither overbought nor oversold; neutral signal)
* **PPO:** 0.76 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 137.3% (significantly higher than the S&P 500, but this needs further qualification given the substantial volatility observed in historical data)

The positive PPO and recent relative divergence suggest upward momentum. The RSI is in neutral territory.  The 2.75 price increase reflects a notable short-term positive move; however, long-term projections should account for historical volatility.  The high expected return should be viewed cautiously in light of the past performance data.

The high expected return projection should be treated with caution and considered alongside the risk profile.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data entry and clarification on the expected return calculation are necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.  Before making any investment decisions, consult a financial advisor.
