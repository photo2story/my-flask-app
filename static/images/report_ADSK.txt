**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** High growth in earlier periods (2015-2021), turning negative in recent years (2020-2025). This indicates a significant shift in performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating substantial volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Positive alpha in earlier periods suggests outperformance compared to the benchmark.  The consistently negative alpha in more recent years suggests underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Low beta values in the earlier periods (close to 0) suggest the stock was not closely correlated with the market. Higher beta values (0.7, 0.8) in recent periods indicate increased market sensitivity.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap in Billions):** The company's market capitalization has fluctuated but remained substantial, indicating it is a large-cap company.

**3. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 290.68
*   **Previous Close:** 292.99
*   **Price Change:** -0.79 (A slight decrease in the most recent session).
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 298.11
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 298.60
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 299.27

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day). This suggests a short-term downtrend.  The fact that the 5-day is below the 20-day, and the 20-day is below the 60-day, further reinforces this bearish signal.

**4. Technical Indicators & Risk Assessment**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3323 (Low Risk).  This suggests the overall market risk is currently low, though it's on the higher end of the "Low Risk" range, approaching "Medium Risk."
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.80. This is below 50, indicating that the stock is not overbought. It's approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* signal a potential for a bounce.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.33. This is negative, signaling a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_70%_Sell 69.9% of holdings (510 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 70% on 2025-08-08)
    *   This is a strong signal to significantly reduce ADSK holdings, moving to a high cash position (70%).  The "Caution" note and the MRI value (while low) seem to be contributing to this recommendation.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Disparity Change:** -0.7 (Negative - Short-term decline). This confirms the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1759.2. *This is an extremely negative figure.* It suggests that, from the current point, a long-term (2+ years) investment in ADSK is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500. *This number warrants careful scrutiny as it seems unusually low.*
*   **Recent Price Change Issue:** The recent price change of -0.79 is not significant enough to indicate a sharp rebound or a significant drop.
