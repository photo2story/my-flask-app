The RSI is approaching oversold levels, indicating potential for a short-term price increase. However, the negative PPO and negative relative divergence suggest bearish short-term momentum. The expected return of 57.2% above the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant positive factor, but this should be considered in the context of the high volatility observed in historical data. The current price is not significantly above or below historical highs or lows, therefore no major price jumps are apparent.
