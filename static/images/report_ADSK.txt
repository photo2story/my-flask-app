## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Analysis

Autodesk Inc. is a software company that makes software products and services for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries.

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **ADSK Cumulative Return:** 62.86%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 38.23%
*   **Absolute Difference:** 25.0
*   **Relative Difference:** 14.9 (meaning ADSK's outperformance is at the 14.9th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO)

**Analysis:** ADSK has outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined. However, the relative difference of 14.9 suggests that the current outperformance is not exceptionally high compared to its historical relationship with the S&P 500.  The recent dip to 14.9 from a range of -19.7 to 281.3 implies the outperformance has diminished.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| 2017-2019  | 71.0%   | 69.0%   | 71.0%  | 1.0  | 39.2   |
| 2018-2020  | 184.0%  | 70.5%   | 184.0% | 1.0  | 65.3   |
| 2019-2021  | 112.0%  | 70.5%   | 111.0% | -0.0 | 60.2   |
| 2020-2022  | -55.0%  | 70.5%   | -44.0% | -0.1 | 40.0   |

| 2023-2025  | -34.0%  | 73.5%   | -78.0% | 0.0  | 61.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Shows periods of very high growth (e.g., 2018-2020) followed by significant declines in recent years.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high maximum drawdown values indicate substantial risk and volatility in the stock's price.  Drawdowns above 70% are generally considered very high.
*   **Alpha:**  Early periods demonstrate high alpha, indicating ADSK significantly outperformed its benchmark.  More recent periods show negative alpha, meaning underperformance.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values around 1.0 early on suggest the stock moved roughly in line with the market.  The shift to near 0 or negative betas in later periods is unusual and potentially indicates a decoupling from overall market movements, or an inverse correlation during certain periods.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization fluctuates, reflecting the stock's performance.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** $285.34
*   **Previous Close:** $290.23
*   **Change:** -1.68%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 287.9
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 292.986
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 297.5375

**Analysis:**  The stock is trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The negative change from the previous close reinforces this.  The price is lower than all moving averages, which is a bearish signal.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3237 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 37.15
*   **PPO:** -0.1067
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_66%_Sell 6.0% of holdings (16 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)
*   **20-day Relative Difference Change:** 0.1 (+): Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return:** 423.1% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The "Low Risk" MRI suggests that, based on the model's criteria, the current market environment poses relatively low risk.  However, this should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 37.15 indicates that the stock is nearing oversold territory (typically below 30).  This *could* suggest a potential for a rebound.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.1067) suggests that the stock is in a downtrend and that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The signal to move to 66% cash and sell a small portion of holdings is a *bearish* signal. The caution flag and the MRI value suggest some concern.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** The positive change indicates a short-term upward trend in the stock's relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **{'price': 285.34, 'previousClose': 290.23, 'change': -1.68}:** 급하락 이슈를 반영
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return (423.1%) should be viewed with skepticism. Such high projections are rare and often based on optimistic assumptions. It suggests potential for significant outperformance over the S&P 500 if held long-term *but* comes with high uncertainty.

### 7. Overall Summary and Considerations

Based on the provided data, Autodesk (ADSK) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Strengths:** Historically strong outperformance vs. the S&P 500, high profit margins, increasing revenue (though recent earnings data needs verification).
*   **Weaknesses/Concerns:** Recent underperformance, negative alpha, high maximum drawdowns, recent price downtrend (below key moving averages), hybrid signal to reduce holdings, recent ROE decline, volatile news environment.
*   **Opportunities:** Potentially oversold RSI, extremely high long-term expected return (though highly uncertain).

**Investment Recommendation:**

The current data suggests a *cautious* approach to ADSK. The recent downtrend, negative alpha, and ROE decline are concerning. The news environment also indicates potential risks.

*   **Existing Holders:** Consider the hybrid signal to reduce holdings and re-evaluate the position in light of recent news and the ROE decline.
*   **Potential Investors:**  Wait for a clearer positive trend, a stabilization of ROE, and a resolution of the uncertainties surrounding the recent news events *before* initiating a position. Thoroughly investigate the factors driving the high expected return and assess its realism. The recent 급하락 이슈를 반영해서 신중하게 접근
