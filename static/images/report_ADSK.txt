    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows very high growth in the earlier periods but significant negative growth in recent periods.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Illustrates high levels of risk, with drawdowns exceeding 67% in all periods, and generally increasing since 2015.
    *   **Alpha:** High positive alpha in the earlier periods suggests the stock significantly outperformed the market.  Negative alpha in recent years shows underperformance relative to the market.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally low. It gradually increased over time, with recent values around 1.  A beta near 1 suggests that ADSK's price movements are now roughly in line with the market. It means the stock now is more sensitive to broader market movements.

*   **Current Price:** 300.71
*   **Previous Close:** 298.21
*   **Change:** 0.84
*   **5-day SMA:** 299.41
*   **20-day SMA:** 301.16
*   **60-day SMA:** 302.59

The stock price shows slight upward momentum, as the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. The recent price increase (change of 0.84) and the fact that the 5-day SMA is catching up to the 20-day SMA could suggest a short-term upward trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - This is contradictory to other indicators and suggests caution is needed when interpreting this.
*   **RSI:** 40.18 - This suggests that the stock is nearing oversold territory but is not there yet. Typically, an RSI below 30 is considered oversold.
*   **PPO:** 0.04 - A slightly positive PPO suggests a slight upward trend in momentum, but it's not a strong signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)" This signal suggests a strong buy recommendation based on a specific investment strategy.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.8 (+) indicating a short-term increase.
*   **Expected Return:** -797.7% -  This is a very negative expected return and raises significant concerns.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Autodesk (ADSK) presents a mixed investment picture.

*   **Negatives:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   Recent negative CAGR, large drawdowns and negative Alpha values indicate a period of struggles.
    *   The "Expected Return" of -797.7% is alarming and needs further investigation. This could be an error in the data or a very specific, negative outlook from the model generating this value. This is a critical point of concern.
    *   Volatile stock price and articles highlighting "crucial support" suggest ongoing uncertainty.
*   **Positives:**
    *   Recent upward trend in revenue and EPS.
    *   Very high and stable profit margins.
    *   Strong and increasing equity.
    *   Positive analyst consensus with a significantly higher target price.
    *   Institutional buying.
    *   MRI (Market Risk Indicator) of 1.0, indicating high investment recommended.

**Overall Assessment:**

ADSK is a company with strong underlying financials (revenue growth, high profit margins, increasing equity), but it has faced significant recent struggles in terms of stock performance relative to the market. While analysts are generally optimistic, the very negative "Expected Return" and the large historical drawdowns warrant caution.

**Recommendation:**

A balanced approach is needed. The positive analyst consensus, institutional buying, and strong financials suggest potential for a turnaround. However, the underperformance compared to the market, the negative "Expected Return," and the stock's volatility indicate significant risk.

Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the negative "Expected Return" is strongly recommended. If this turns out to be an error, it would significantly improve the overall outlook for ADSK. Investors should also carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in ADSK.
