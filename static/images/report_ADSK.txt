**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 66.0% | 17.6% | 38.0% | 0.1 | 22.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 86.0% | 16.4% | 67.0% | 0.2 | 27.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 78.0% | 16.4% | 48.0% | 0.6 | 39.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 155.0% | 17.7% | 128.0% | 0.2 | 65.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 79.0% | 19.6% | 8.0% | 0.2 | 60.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -62.0% | 19.6% | -71.0% | 0.2 | 40.3 |
| 2021-2023  | -85.0% | 19.6% | -108.0% | 1.2 | 52.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 1.0% | 17.9% | -32.0% | 1.3 | 63.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 58.0% | 17.9% | -3.0% | 1.3 | 67.1 |

The high and fluctuating alpha values suggest periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the market, reflecting the stock's volatility.  The beta generally remains relatively low except for the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods, indicating lower market sensitivity but this can be misleading as the high alpha values dominate.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $311.34
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $306.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $296.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $301.10

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average suggests a recent increase in the price is not extreme.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 79.53  (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.)
* **PPO:** 0.7451 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +5.2 (Short-term upward trend.)

The high RSI suggests the stock is overbought, indicating a potential near-term pullback. However, the positive PPO and the recent price increase indicate a short-term upward momentum.  The 0.45% daily price increase is not extreme, avoiding a classification of a "rapid surge."

* **Expected Return:** 61.4% (Long-term expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500.)  This is a high figure and should be viewed cautiously.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | $1.41 B     | *(Note: Duplicate entry likely an error.)*

| 2023-10-31 | $1.48B | 16.26% |
| 2023-07-31 | $1.21B | 18.41% |

Equity is growing, but ROE has decreased recently, possibly due to increased investment or other factors.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

ADSK has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with high growth potential. However, the high RSI indicates potential near-term price correction.  The high expected return should be treated cautiously and considered in the context of the high volatility shown in the alpha and beta analysis and the overbought RSI. Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data point and the decrease in ROE is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The long-term outlook remains positive, contingent upon the company continuing to deliver on revenue growth and maintaining reasonably high profit margins.  A thorough understanding of the inherent risks associated with this level of volatility is crucial for potential investors.
