**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook or analyst opinions are provided.  Therefore, no analysis can be done on these factors. Information on recent earnings announcements is presented in section 4 above.



**7. Summary:**

ADSK has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period in question. However, recent price action and technical indicators (RSI, PPO, and relative divergence) suggest a potentially bearish short-term outlook.  The long-term outlook is more positive according to the provided expected return, assuming that current price does not reflect a recent rapid increase or decrease.  Revenue shows steady growth, while profit margins remain high, but ROE has decreased. Further analysis requires a more comprehensive dataset, including details on earnings expectations and more recent news and analyst sentiment. The limited data points on EPS and Revenue present a challenge in identifying definitive trends.  The provided data is insufficient to draw firm conclusions about the company's future performance.
