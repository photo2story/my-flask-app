Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) is a multinational software corporation that makes design and engineering software.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO). While the provided data shows some positive indicators (e.g., relatively low Market Risk Indicator), a significant negative divergence between ADSK and VOO needs further investigation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | 1.57 B$       |
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31 | 1.50 B$       |

| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | 1.41 B$       | *(Duplicate entry - likely an error)*

Revenue shows a slight upward trend, while EPS fluctuates.  The duplicate entry requires clarification and correction of the data source.  More comprehensive data, including quarterly breakdowns, is needed for a thorough financial analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial assessment.  This data is crucial for understanding the company's profitability and overall financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has shown significant volatility and recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While some technical indicators suggest positive momentum, the historical data reveals substantial risk. The lack of comprehensive financial data hinders a complete evaluation.  Before making any investment decision, more robust financial data is necessary, alongside a deeper analysis of the factors driving both the recent underperformance and the high projected long-term return.  The high expected return should be considered with considerable skepticism given the recent performance.  Further investigation is warranted before any investment conclusions are drawn.
