**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has shown periods of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but recent performance has been negative.  While long-term projections suggest significant potential, current indicators (high MRI, negative PPO, price action below moving averages) point to a high-risk environment.  The recent price drop warrants caution. Further investigation is needed to fully assess the company's current valuation and risk profile before making any investment decisions.  The long-term expected return should be viewed with skepticism until more supporting data is provided.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent price decline, the fluctuations in EPS, and the projected long-term returns is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
