**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has shown strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.

However, further investigation is needed to address inconsistencies in the earnings data and the recent decline in ROE.  The considerable volatility in both CAGR and Alpha suggests that investment decisions should consider risk tolerance carefully.  The duplicated data point in the earnings data needs to be resolved to ensure accurate analysis.
