The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values in the earlier years demonstrate strong past performance. However, the significant negative CAGR in 2020-2023 and the relatively low CAGR in 2022-2024 suggest recent underperformance.  The increasing Beta indicates growing market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $285.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $294.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $302.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $300.20

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  The significant drop from the previous close ($291.02) suggests a recent negative price movement.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 29.25 - Suggests the stock is oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.71 - Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -5.6% - Confirms a short-term downtrend.

Given the significant price drop (`{'price': 285.0, 'previousClose': 291.02, 'change': -2.068586351453502}`),  a sharp decline is evident. The high expected return (104.2%) over the long term (2+ years) suggests potential for recovery and outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this is contingent upon market conditions and the company's future performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |

| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | $1.41 B     | *(Note: Duplicate entry.  Potential data error.)*


Revenue shows a relatively consistent growth trend, though EPS shows some fluctuation.  The duplicate entry for December 2024 requires clarification.

| 2023-10-31 | $1.48B | 16.26% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has shown strong long-term performance exceeding the S&P 500. However, recent price action and some financial indicators (lower ROE, negative PPO, and below-average moving averages) suggest a period of underperformance.  While the oversold RSI and high projected long-term return are positive signals, investors should carefully monitor the company's financial performance and market trends before making investment decisions. The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings) warrant further investigation.  Further due diligence is recommended.
