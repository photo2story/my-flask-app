*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.23

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -2511.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 30.55 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30). This could suggest a potential for a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, reinforcing the downward trend.

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change confirms a short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The highly negative expected return (-2511.7%) is very concerning and suggests extreme caution.

*   **Analyst Buy Rating:** The average analyst consensus is a "Buy" with a target price significantly higher than the current price.

However:

*   **Underperformance:** ADSK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Downward Trend:**  The stock is currently trading below its SMAs, indicating a short-term and potentially longer-term downward trend.
*   **Negative Expected Return:**  The -2511.7% expected return is extremely concerning and suggests potential substantial losses if held long-term (the number is so high it should be checked for accuracy).
*   **Mixed News:** Recent news includes an institutional investor reducing holdings.

**Overall Conclusion:**

While Autodesk's financial performance in terms of revenue, profit margins, and equity is strong, the recent stock price underperformance and negative expected returns are major red flags. The hybrid signal recommending a "very safe" buy is inconsistent with the other indicators. The stock is exhibiting a clear downtrend, and the negative expected return and underperformance compared to the S&P 500 suggest significant risk.

A cautious approach is warranted. Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the underlying factors driving the negative expected return is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions. It is possible there are external factors (market conditions, sector-specific challenges) influencing Autodesk's stock price more than its underlying financial health.
