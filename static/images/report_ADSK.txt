    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Shows ADSK's performance relative to the market, with positive alpha in earlier periods, meaning it outperformed. However, recent periods show negative alpha, indicating underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Measures ADSK's volatility relative to the market. A Beta approaching 1.0 or higher in recent periods suggests ADSK's price movements are becoming more correlated with, and potentially amplified compared to, the overall market.

**Analysis:**  The Alpha/Beta data suggests ADSK was a strong performer earlier, outperforming the market with lower volatility. However, recent periods indicate significant underperformance, higher volatility relative to the market, and substantial risk (high MDD).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 300.71
*   **Previous Close:** 298.21
*   **Change:** 0.84
*   **5-day SMA:** 299.41
*   **20-day SMA:** 301.1574
*   **60-day SMA:** 302.5851

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly up in the last day. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which is below 60-day SMAs, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend, but this needs further confirmation.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.18 (Neutral, not overbought or oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.0398 (Neutral, indicating slight upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 0.8 (+): Short-term increase.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -797.7 (Very Negative)

**Analysis:**  Despite the high MRI suggesting investment, the very negative expected return is a major red flag. The RSI and PPO are neutral, and the recent divergence change indicates a small recent increase, but the overall picture is concerning, especially given the poor cumulative return discussed earlier.  The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, but this contradicts the expected return and needs careful consideration in light of the other data.  The recent price change reflects some intraday fluctuation but doesn't necessarily indicate a strong trend.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Autodesk (ADSK) Stock Moves -4.50%:**  Indicates a recent significant price drop, potentially related to broader market conditions or company-specific news.
*   **Burney Co. Sells Shares:** Suggests institutional investors may be reducing their positions in ADSK.
*   **Autodesk Stock Near Crucial Support:**  Implies the stock is at a price level where it might bounce back, but could also fall further.
*   **Autodesk (ADSK) Stock Moves -1.51%:** Another recent price drop, reinforcing the downward trend concern.
*   **Autodesk: Looking Back At The Past 3 Years:**  Likely a more in-depth look at the company's performance, which, based on other data, might highlight recent struggles.
*   **Autodesk Stock Jumps on Strong Results, Upbeat Forecast:** This is a positive signal, potentially contradicting other negative news, and could indicate a possible turnaround.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed.  Negative headlines about stock drops and institutional selling raise concerns, but the headline about strong results and an upbeat forecast offers a glimmer of hope.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean of 1.56)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 366.13 / 460.00 / 275.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes indicated in the provided information.

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" recommendation and see upside potential, with an average target price significantly higher than the current price. However, the low target price is lower than the current, meaning some analysts don't have positive outlook. This contrasts sharply with the negative expected return calculated earlier.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Conflicting Signals:** There are several conflicting signals. The high MRI suggests investment is recommended, and analysts have a "Buy" consensus. The increasing Revenue, Equity and ROE also mean there is some upside potential. However, the very negative expected return, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative Alpha in recent years, and recent negative news headlines are major red flags.
*   **Recent Improvement:** Recent earnings data and revenue show positive trends, suggesting a possible turnaround. However, it's too early to confirm this.
*   **Risk/Reward:** The high MDD indicates substantial risk. The potential reward, based on analyst target prices, could be significant, but the negative expected return tempers this.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the conflicting signals and significant risks, a cautious approach is warranted. Further research is needed to understand the discrepancy between the analyst outlook and the negative expected return. Before investing, monitor ADSK's performance and news flow closely to see if the recent positive earnings trend continues and if the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 improves.

In summary, ADSK presents a high-risk, potentially high-reward situation. Thorough due diligence is crucial before making any investment decision.
