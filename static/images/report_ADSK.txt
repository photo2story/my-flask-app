**1. Performance Analysis:**

Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that makes software for various industries, including architecture, engineering, and construction.

Over the period analyzed, Autodesk slightly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 108.85% compared to VOO's 108.62%.  While the difference is minimal at the end of the period, the relative divergence indicator suggests that this slight outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows significant variability in performance over different timeframes.  High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values are interspersed with periods of significant negative returns and high maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The increasing Beta values from 2015-2023 suggest increasing sensitivity to market movements, culminating in substantial negative returns during the 2021-2023 period.  However,  recent years show the Beta declining, and the CAGR is positive. The high Alpha values in the most recent years suggest the stock's outperformance relative to the market is attributed to factors specific to ADSK, rather than pure market movements.  Capitalization has also substantially increased.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $259.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $265.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $285.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $294.94

The current price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  The recent price change (-0.24%) reflects a minor decrease.


**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

The RSI of 10.35 is significantly below 30, suggesting the stock is severely oversold.  The negative PPO (-1.16) further confirms a bearish sentiment. The recent relative divergence of -2.5 indicates a short-term downward trend.  The substantial negative price change, while small in percentage terms, is noteworthy given the already oversold conditions and adds to the bearish sentiment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK shows a slight outperformance against the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, but this is within the context of significant volatility.  The current price is below its moving averages, and technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest an oversold and bearish market sentiment.  While recent earnings show increasing revenue, EPS shows some fluctuation. Financial information reveals strong profitability and revenue growth, but ROE shows some variability.  The high expected return (154.5% over the long term versus the S&P 500) needs further investigation to determine the basis of this prediction.  More detailed analysis of the historical data and the calculation methodology for the expected return is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.  The current market sentiment is negative, however the long-term projections suggest strong potential but further research is required to justify the high long-term return estimate.  The substantial volatility observed highlights the need for a robust risk management strategy if investing in ADSK.
