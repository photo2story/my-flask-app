While the long-term outlook (based on provided expected return) appears positive,  a thorough analysis of macroeconomic factors and a deeper dive into the company's financials and strategic direction would be necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return should be interpreted cautiously given the observed volatility.  The recent earnings data requires further analysis with more data points for trend identification.
