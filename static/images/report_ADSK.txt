*   **Alpha:** The alpha values indicate outperformance (positive alpha) in the earlier periods, but significant underperformance (negative alpha) in recent years.  This suggests ADSK is not generating excess returns relative to its risk profile.
*   **Beta:** Beta values have increased over time, suggesting ADSK is becoming more correlated with the overall market.  A beta above 1.0 in the latest period means it amplifies market movements.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   What are the specific drivers behind the increasing revenue and profit margins?
*   Why the increase of Beta values?
