**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 300.71
*   **Last Market:**
    *   Price: 301.23
    *   Previous Close: 300.71
    *   Change: 0.17
*   **5-day SMA:** 299.41
*   **20-day SMA:** 301.16
*   **60-day SMA:** 302.59

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly above the 5-day SMA but below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a possible short-term upward trend, but the price is still below longer-term averages.
*   The small change in the last market indicates relatively stable trading.

**3. RSI, PPO and Divergence Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.18
*   **PPO:** 0.04
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90), invest 0.8% monthly.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 0.8 (+) indicates short-term increase (단기상승)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -797.7%

**Analysis:**

*   The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a high investment recommendation, which contradicts many other indicators here. This discrepancy needs further investigation.  The MRI model might be oversimplified or not adequately capturing the recent negative performance of ADSK.
*   An RSI of 40.18 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but it's closer to oversold territory.
*   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being slightly positive suggests some short-term upward momentum.
*   The hybrid signal gives a confident "Buy" with 100% of capital; the model also emphasizes that it's "very safe".
*   The recent divergence change indicates a short-term upward trend relative to the comparison.
*   **Critically**, the Expected Return of -797.7% is extremely negative and should be a major red flag. This indicates that the model projects significant underperformance in the future.

*   **Figma vs. Autodesk Comparison:** Highlights competitive pressures in the design software market.
