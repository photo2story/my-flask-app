**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has demonstrated strong long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the data reveals periods of substantial volatility and high market sensitivity (high beta).  The recent price dip and the conflicting 2024-12-03 earnings data warrant further investigation.  While the long-term expected return is high, investors should carefully consider the inherent risk associated with ADSK's high beta and past performance volatility.  A thorough due diligence including analysis of recent financial statements and future market projections is crucial before making any investment decisions. The financial information provided should be cross-referenced with official company reports for comprehensive analysis.
