**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **ADSK Cumulative Return:** 63.24%

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, and Beta across different periods.  High CAGRs are observed in some years, but also periods of significant negative returns, especially in 2021-2024.  Beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity.  The consistently positive Alpha suggests that ADSK might have generated some excess returns over the market benchmark in several periods, though more context and additional details about the calculation are needed.  It's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 70.0% | 57.2% | 41.0% | 0.1 | 22.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 69.0% | 69.0% | 51.0% | 0.1 | 27.4 |
| 2017-2019  | 71.0% | 69.0% | 41.0% | 0.4 | 39.1 |
| 2018-2020  | 184.0% | 70.5% | 159.0% | 0.2 | 65.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 112.0% | 70.5% | 57.0% | 0.2 | 59.9 |
| 2020-2022  | -55.0% | 70.5% | -61.0% | 0.3 | 39.8 |
| 2021-2023  | -140.0% | 72.0% | -157.0% | 0.9 | 51.9 |
| 2022-2024  | -73.0% | 72.0% | -90.0% | 1.0 | 63.0 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $263.53
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $249.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $260.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $280.14

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium term.  The recent significant price increase of $10.34 from the previous close suggests a potential recent price surge.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 47.25 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.21 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.1 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 230.8% (This is a significant figure and needs further clarification on its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions.  A 230.8% return is exceptionally high and unlikely unless based on very specific, perhaps overly optimistic, projections.)


The high MRI suggests high market risk. The negative PPO and recent negative relative divergence reinforce the bearish short-term momentum.  The large price increase from the previous close should be investigated further for any significant news or events that might have triggered this sudden rise.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  A further deeper analysis is needed to assess the underlying trends and the reasons for the variations. Further contextual information such as year-over-year growth would be beneficial for a complete assessment.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | $1.57 B     |
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31 | $1.50 B     |
| 2024-06-10 | 1.17 | $1.42 B     |
| 2023-12-04 | 1.13 | $1.41 B     |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | $1.41 B     | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


**5) Financial Information:**

The financial data shows consistently high profit margins, although there's a slight downward trend. ROE (Return on Equity) also shows some volatility. The significant drop in equity from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 requires further investigation to understand the reasons behind it.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $1.64B     | 90.60%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $1.57B     | 90.64%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $1.50B     | 90.70%        |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.41B     | 91.02%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE          |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $2.62B     | 11.56%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.62B     | 10.51%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $2.47B     | 11.40%        |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.48B     | 16.26%        |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

ADSK's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been mixed, with periods of outperformance and underperformance.  While recent price action shows some short-term upward momentum, technical indicators point towards a bearish trend in the medium term.  Earnings show some volatility, and further analysis is required to determine the underlying trends. High profit margins are positive but need to be balanced against the concerns around fluctuating ROE and equity.  The extremely high projected return requires further explanation and scrutiny.  A comprehensive analysis requires more detailed information and context, including a deeper dive into the reasons behind the observed volatility in several key financial metrics. Before making any investment decision, further thorough due diligence is crucial.
