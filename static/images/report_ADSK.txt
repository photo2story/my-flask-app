**6) Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance has shown greater volatility. While the long-term outlook remains positive, indicated by the high expected return, the recent negative trend and high beta suggest the need for caution.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent decline in ROE and the volatility in the EPS and Beta is required before making a definitive investment recommendation.  A deeper analysis of the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and industry trends is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The duplication in the earnings data requires clarification.
