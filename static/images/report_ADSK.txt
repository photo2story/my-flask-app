*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 55.63
*   **PPO:** 0.74
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)

*   PPO of 0.74 suggests a slight upward trend momentum, but not significantly strong.
*   The Hybrid Signal leans towards a "Buy" recommendation, suggesting the system sees potential value despite the underperformance, but the MRI value of 0.9 for Very Safe suggests that the safety rating of ADSK is not very high.
*   The recent decline in relative divergence (-1.0) indicates a recent short-term downtrend compared to the S&P 500.
*   **The extremely negative expected return (-627.8%) is a major red flag.** This indicates that, based on the model, the expected return is significantly lower than the S&P 500. This is a critical point that suggests caution.
