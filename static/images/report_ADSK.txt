## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) is a multinational software corporation that develops and sells 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software.  Over the period analyzed, ADSK's cumulative return of 166.04% significantly outperformed the S&P 500's return of 124.78%.  The difference is 41.26%, placing it in the 29.42nd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a maximum outperformance of 195.23% and a minimum underperformance of -22.93%).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $302.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $306.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $295.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $277.80

The stock price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend, but above both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential longer-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Strength:**

* **RSI:** 60.25 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.09 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +4.03 (Positive, indicating short-term upward momentum)

The relatively low PPO value combined with the slightly elevated RSI suggests a potential for a short-term pullback, despite the positive short-term relative strength. The fact that the current price ($302.04) is close to but slightly below the 5-day moving average does not indicate a dramatic price change (no sharp upturn or downturn). The expected return of 4.45% represents a potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 through consistent investment.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31  | $1.50 Billion |
| 2024-06-10 | 1.17  | $1.42 Billion |
| 2023-12-04 | 1.13  | $1.41 Billion |
| 2023-08-29 | 1.04  | $1.34 Billion |
| 2023-08-29 | 1.04  | $1.34 Billion | *(Duplicate entry)*


The company shows a consistent growth in revenue and EPS over the past year.  Further analysis is needed to compare this performance against analyst expectations for the most recent quarter (September 3, 2024).  Access to analyst estimates is crucial for a complete performance evaluation.


**5. Financial Health (Missing from original prompt):**  

*No information regarding debt, cash flow, or other crucial financial health metrics was provided.*  Access to a complete financial statement is crucial for a robust analysis of Autodesk's financial standing.


**6. Financial Data Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  The data indicates relatively high and consistent profit margins (above 90%) and a slight upward trend in revenue. However, missing data for the 2024-01-31 quarter prevents a complete picture.

**Capital and Profitability:** Return on Equity (ROE) is strong but shows a downward trend.  Again, the missing data point for 2024-01-31 hinders complete analysis.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*No specific recent news (within the last two days) from sources like Shacknews or Finbold was provided for analysis.*  Up-to-date news and analyst opinions are crucial for a comprehensive stock evaluation.  The inclusion of details regarding recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights is needed.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has demonstrated strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent financial results show growth in revenue and EPS. However, the analysis is limited due to missing data points (Q1 2024 financial data and recent news articles).  The current price sits below the 5-day moving average but above the 20 and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term pullback, but a longer-term upward trend may remain.  A thorough analysis requires completing the missing information (Q1 2024 financials, analyst estimates, recent news, and comprehensive financial statement data).  The current technical indicators present a mixed picture, necessitating more data to form a confident conclusion.
