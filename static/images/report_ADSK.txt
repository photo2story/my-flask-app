Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) is a multinational software corporation that makes software products and services for various industries.  The following analysis assesses ADSK's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) based on provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **ADSK Cumulative Return:** 61.92%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 85.44%
* **Return Difference:** -23.5% (ADSK underperformed VOO by 23.5%)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance relative to the market across different periods.  While some periods show significant outperformance (e.g., 2018-2020 with a 145% CAGR and a high Alpha), others show substantial underperformance (e.g., 2021-2023 with a -111% CAGR and a high Beta).  The Beta consistently rises after 2020, indicating increasing sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $257.15
* **Previous Close:** $267.93
* **Change:** -$4.02 (a -1.5% decrease)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $262.62
* **20-day Moving Average:** $261.63
* **60-day Moving Average:** $282.90

The recent price action shows a downward trend, with the closing price below all three moving averages, suggesting bearish momentum.  The -4.02 change indicates a moderate one-day decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 52.69 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.33 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, although not strongly so)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -1.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 59.1% (Expected to outperform the S&P 500 significantly over the long term)

The relatively low MRI suggests a manageable level of risk, while the RSI and PPO provide mixed signals. The negative recent relative divergence change and the fact that the current price is below the moving averages indicate bearish momentum in the short term.  However, the high long-term expected return suggests potential upside over a longer timeframe.  The significant price drop of -$4.02 should be noted as a potential short-term bearish indicator, but is not necessarily indicative of a sustained decline.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-12-03 | $1.28 | $1.57 Billion |
| 2024-09-03 | $1.31 | $1.50 Billion |
| 2024-06-10 | $1.17 | $1.42 Billion |
| 2023-12-04 | $1.13 | $1.41 Billion |
| 2024-12-03 | $1.13 | $1.41 Billion | *(Duplicate Entry - likely an error)*


There's a noticeable fluctuation in EPS and Revenue.  The data needs clarification as there is a duplicate entry for December 2024.  A more detailed analysis requires consistent and accurate data.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31   | $1.64B  | 90.60%        |
| 2024-10-31   | $1.57B  | 90.64%        |
| 2024-07-31   | $1.50B  | 90.70%        |
| 2023-10-31   | $1.41B  | 91.02%        |

Revenue is steadily increasing, and profit margins remain consistently high (above 90%). This is a positive sign.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE     |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| 2025-01-31   | $2.62B  | 11.56%  |
| 2024-10-31   | $2.62B  | 10.51%  |
| 2024-07-31   | $2.47B  | 11.40%  |
| 2023-10-31   | $1.48B  | 16.26%  |

Equity shows growth, but ROE is fluctuating. The significant drop in ROE from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 and the subsequent increase deserves further investigation.  This could indicate changes in capital structure or investment strategies.

**6. Overall Summary:**

ADSK has shown periods of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but recent performance has lagged.  While financial indicators like revenue and profit margins are strong, recent price action and some inconsistencies in the data (duplicate earnings data, ROE fluctuations) warrant caution.  The high expected return over the long term suggests that a long-term investment strategy might be worthwhile, but short-term volatility should be expected.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the provided data and a more in-depth analysis of the company's fundamentals are needed before making any investment decisions.
