**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **ADSK Cumulative Return:** 57.92%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 72.42%

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent Alpha and Beta values across different time periods.  While CAGR remains relatively high in most periods, the substantial negative returns in recent years (-55%, -140%, -73%, -39%) significantly impact overall performance.  The high Beta values (especially in the recent years) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) in recent periods also indicates significant risk.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 70.0% | 57.2% | 37.0% | 0.1 | 22.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 69.0% | 69.0% | 48.0% | 0.1 | 27.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 71.0% | 69.0% | 37.0% | 0.5 | 39.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 184.0% | 70.5% | 154.0% | 0.3 | 66.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 112.0% | 70.5% | 51.0% | 0.3 | 61.1 |
| 2020-2022  | -55.0% | 70.5% | -63.0% | 0.4 | 40.6 |
| 2021-2023  | -140.0% | 72.0% | -160.0% | 1.1 | 52.9 |
| 2022-2024  | -73.0% | 72.0% | -94.0% | 1.1 | 64.2 |
| 2023-2025  | -39.0% | 73.5% | -49.0% | 1.0 | 55.3 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $254.27
* **5-day Moving Average:** $259.99
* **20-day Moving Average:** $260.16
* **60-day Moving Average:** $276.09

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price drop (-2.0 from previous close) contributes to this bearish signal.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.62 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.3494 (Positive, but relatively low suggesting weak momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 142% (significantly higher than S&P 500 over 2+ years)

The recent price drop of $2.0 is notable, but it isn't a dramatic plunge, and the positive short-term divergence suggests a potential rebound. However, the RSI and PPO are not strongly bullish, and the negative trend overall should be heeded.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings have been relatively consistent, hovering around $1.13-$1.31 EPS. Revenue shows a slight upward trend, albeit at a slower pace. The data inconsistency in the table (2024-12-03 appearing twice) requires clarification.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | $1.57B      |
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31 | $1.50B      |
| 2024-06-10 | 1.17 | $1.42B      |
| 2023-12-04 | 1.13 | $1.41B      |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | $1.41B      | *(Duplicate entry)*


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows a steady increase, while profit margins remain exceptionally high (around 90%).  Equity increased significantly in the latest quarter (2025-01-31), potentially due to share buybacks or profits. ROE has fluctuated but generally shows profitability.  The drop in ROE from 2024-07-31 to 2023-10-31 is noteworthy and warrants further investigation.

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE     |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|---------|
| 2025-01-31 | $1.64B  | 90.60%        | $2.62B | 11.56%  |
| 2024-10-31 | $1.57B  | 90.64%        | $2.62B | 10.51%  |
| 2024-07-31 | $1.50B  | 90.70%        | $2.47B | 11.40%  |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.41B  | 91.02%        | $1.48B | 16.26%  |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

ADSK's performance has been mixed. While the company shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, its recent stock performance significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and negative returns in several periods. The high Beta and MDD values point to considerable risk. The projected long-term expected return is substantial, but this needs to be viewed in light of the considerable risk and recent underperformance.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent negative trends, particularly the substantial decline in ROE and the inconsistent earnings data, is recommended before any investment decision.  A more in-depth analysis of the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.
