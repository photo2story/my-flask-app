* **Cumulative Return (ADSK):** 62.24%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 66.35%
* **Return Difference (ADSK vs VOO):** -4.11%

**1) Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a fluctuating performance of ADSK compared to the market (represented by its beta).  While exhibiting high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods (notably 2018-2020),  recent years (2021-2025) show significant negative returns and increasing beta, suggesting increased market sensitivity during that time.  The alpha, while generally positive, shows inconsistency and increased volatility in recent years, implying that outperformance wasn't consistently achieved and was impacted by market fluctuations.  The market cap (Cap(B)) also fluctuates, indicating shifts in investor perception of ADSK's valuation.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2016-2018  | 69.0% | 69.0% | 51.0% | 0.1 | 27.4 |
| 2017-2019  | 71.0% | 69.0% | 41.0% | 0.4 | 39.1 |
| 2018-2020  | 184.0% | 70.5% | 159.0% | 0.2 | 65.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 112.0% | 70.5% | 57.0% | 0.2 | 59.9 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $258.45
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $252.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $261.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $279.10

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The recent 0.6% increase from the previous close could be a minor price bounce.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.57 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.13 (Slightly positive, suggesting a potential bullish momentum, though weak.)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -3.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 230.8% (This represents a significant potential outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, but requires careful consideration given the recent volatility.)
The 0.6% price increase is not a significant enough change to be considered a sharp rebound or drop.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | $1.57 B      |
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31 | $1.50 B      |
| 2024-06-10 | 1.17 | $1.42 B      |
| 2023-12-04 | 1.13 | $1.41 B      |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | $1.41 B      | *(Duplicate Data - likely a typo)*

There is a slight downward trend in EPS and revenue in recent quarters,  though the December 2024 data point is duplicated and should be verified.  Further analysis would require more data points and a comparison with previous years' performance.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $1.64B | 90.60% |
| 2024-10-31 | $1.57B | 90.64% |
| 2024-07-31 | $1.50B | 90.70% |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.41B | 91.02% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-01-31 | $2.62B | 11.56% |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.62B | 10.51% |
| 2024-07-31 | $2.47B | 11.40% |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.48B | 16.26% |

Revenue shows a steady increase. Profit margins are consistently high but slightly decreasing.  Equity shows a jump between 2024-07-31 and 2024-10-31 and again between 2024-10-31 and 2025-01-31, which is noteworthy and requires investigation. ROE is fluctuating and decreased sharply in 2024-10-31 compared to the prior quarter; requires further analysis to determine the cause.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

ADSK's performance has been mixed.  While it has shown periods of significant growth, recent years have exhibited considerable volatility and underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition, but the high market risk indicator and negative recent relative divergence raise concerns.  The high projected long-term return is attractive, but this forecast must be viewed cautiously given the current market sentiment and recent financial performance.  A thorough review of the duplicated earnings data and the significant change in Equity and ROE is crucial. Further investigation into the underlying causes of recent volatility and the discrepancies in the data is recommended before making any investment decisions.
