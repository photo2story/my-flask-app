**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that makes design software for various industries.

The cumulative return of ADSK is 144.12%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 52.12%.  The difference is 92.0%, placing it in the 31.5th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong historical outperformance, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows inconsistent performance over the years. While recent years (2023-2025) show a positive CAGR of 50% and a low maximum drawdown (MDD), earlier periods show negative CAGRs and high MDDs.

* **20-day Moving Average:** $294.43
* **60-day Moving Average:** $299.44

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a minor recent pullback. The price is above the 20-day moving average, indicating short-term support. The slight decrease from the previous close (-$0.08) is not significant.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK shows strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, supported by increasing revenue and generally high profit margins. However, recent earnings data show some fluctuation in EPS, and the ROE has decreased. Technical indicators suggest a positive, but not overly bullish, short-term outlook.  The projected long-term return is exceptionally high, but hinges on the continued success of the company and the sustainability of current trends.  Further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return and the historical volatility necessitate a careful risk assessment aligned with the investor's risk tolerance.  The inconsistencies in the Alpha/Beta analysis over time must be considered as well.
