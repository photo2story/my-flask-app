Autodesk's cumulative return (138.02%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (113.65%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 24.4%, placing it at the 25.4th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant year-to-year variability, highlighting the inherent risk associated with this stock.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $293.32
* **5-day Moving Average:** $296.86
* **20-day Moving Average:** $301.28
* **60-day Moving Average:** $297.60

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.49 –  Suggests the stock is in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.35 – Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -0.2 –  Confirms a recent weakening in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 80.7% –  This implies a significantly higher return than the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the investment thesis holds.  The high expected return should be considered in light of the high beta and volatility observed historically.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some variability.

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally increased quarter-over-quarter, though the growth rate appears to be slowing down in recent periods.
* **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS has fluctuated, with a slight dip in the most recent quarter. There is no information provided regarding whether these earnings met or exceeded expectations.  Therefore, no "beats" or "misses" can be definitively assessed.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is steadily increasing, while profit margins are remarkably consistent and high, showing a strong financial performance.  However, it's crucial to note a slight downward trend in profit margins over the past two quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows strong growth, but the Return on Equity (ROE) has decreased significantly over the past two quarters, indicating a potential shift in profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or market outlook information (within the last two days or otherwise) was provided. Therefore, no analysis can be conducted on this section.  Similarly, there are no provided analyst opinions.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Autodesk shows strong long-term growth potential, exceeding the S&P 500's performance historically. However, the recent price action indicates a short-term bearish trend, supported by technical indicators like RSI and PPO. The high expected return should be viewed cautiously given the stock's historically high volatility and beta.  Recent earnings show consistent revenue growth, but the decrease in ROE and slight decrease in profit margins warrant further investigation.  The absence of recent news and analyst sentiment prevents a fully comprehensive assessment.  Further analysis including a broader timeframe and a more detailed breakdown of the expected return calculation would be necessary for a complete investment decision.
