Revenue shows consistent year-over-year growth.  Profit margins are relatively high and stable, fluctuating slightly around 90%.  A small decrease is observed in Q4 2024.

**Capital and Profitability:**

Equity has increased significantly.  However, ROE has decreased substantially from 18.41% (Q2 2023) to 10.51% (Q4 2024), suggesting a decline in the efficiency of using shareholder equity to generate profits. This decrease warrants further investigation.  The drop in Q3 & Q4 2024 ROE may be related to increased equity.

ADSK significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the specified period, showing strong revenue growth. However, the recent earnings data reveals a mixed picture. While revenue continues to grow, EPS shows some volatility and a recent decline despite revenue increases suggesting a decrease in profit margins.  The sharp decrease in Return on Equity is also a significant concern. Further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind the decreasing EPS and ROE, including analysis of operating expenses and other financial metrics not presented here.
