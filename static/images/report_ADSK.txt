* **5-Day Moving Average:** $260.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $260.81

* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 147.4% (This represents a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon.  However, the high volatility observed in the past must be considered).

The slight price drop (-$0.27) is not significant enough to be considered a sharp drop.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

ADSK shows strong financial fundamentals with high revenue growth and profit margins. However, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 in recent periods, exhibiting high volatility. The high beta suggests sensitivity to market fluctuations.  While the long-term expected return is positive, significant risks exist due to the observed volatility and recent negative performance.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in earnings data and the fluctuations in ROE is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The unusually high profit margin should also be investigated to ensure accuracy and understand its sustainability.
