| 2023-2025 | -21.0% | 81.2% | -80.0% | 1.4  | 62.2  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows strong historical growth, but recent periods (2020-2025) show significant negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates substantial risk, with MDDs consistently above 67%, especially in recent years.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha represents the excess return relative to a benchmark.  The earlier years showed positive Alpha, indicating outperformance.  However, recent periods show negative Alpha, indicating significant underperformance.
*   **Beta:**  Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A beta of 1.0 or higher suggests the stock is more volatile than the market. The rising Beta values in the later periods (0.7 to 1.4) could indicate increased sensitivity to market movements.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 290.80
*   **Previous Close:** 286.94
*   **Change:** 1.34 (Increase)
*   **5-day SMA:** 290.63
*   **20-day SMA:** 298.16
*   **60-day SMA:** 310.27

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price closed slightly higher than the previous close, suggesting a minor positive movement.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA.  This generally indicates a downtrend, as shorter-term moving averages are below longer-term ones. The stock is trading below all three moving averages.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 34.32
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.258
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.1 (+) (단기상승 = Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -420.8%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation.
*   An RSI of 34.32 suggests the stock is nearing *oversold* territory (typically below 30), which could signal a potential bounce.
*   A negative PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, confirming the downtrend.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a 100% allocation of cash to buy shares, deeming the investment "Very Safe" with a high MRI of 0.90. This is counter-intuitive, given the negative expected return and other bearish signals.
*   The Recent relative divergence change indicates a short-term positive movement, potentially a minor rebound.
*   The extremely negative Expected Return (-420.8%) is a major red flag and suggests significant downside risk if held long-term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   The news headlines are mixed:
    *   One article discusses a recent stock move downwards (-1.46%).
    *   Another article notes a position increase by Legal & General Group Plc.
    *   There is an article discussing long-term returns, which is important given the negative expected return.
    *   An article anticipates Q3 earnings results.
    *   There's a comparison with Intuit stock.
    *   Another article discusses a previous stock move downwards (-4.50%).
**Analysis:**

*   The recent news articles reflect a mixed sentiment with a downside focus. The articles mentioning stock drops and focus on earnings and future performance suggest uncertainty. The positive note is the increased position by an investment firm, which could signal confidence.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.63)
*   **Opinions:** 28 analysts
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 360.39 / 430.00 / 246.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No Changes

**Analysis:**

*   Despite the poor performance indicators, the analyst consensus is still a "Buy," with a mean rating of 1.63. This presents a conflict with the quantitative data.
*   The average target price of 360.39 represents a significant upside from the current price of 290.80. However, the low target price of 246 is a notable risk.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Performance:**  Autodesk has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a negative divergence. The recent negative CAGR and Alpha reinforce this.
*   **Risk:** The high MDD values indicate substantial risk. The rising Beta values also indicate increased sensitivity to the market.
*   **Technicals:** The stock is trading below its moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The RSI is nearing oversold territory, which could signal a potential bounce.
*   **Momentum:** The recent relative divergence change suggests a short-term positive movement, but the longer-term trend is negative.
*   **Financials:** Revenue and profit margins are strong. ROE is generally healthy.
*   **Sentiment:** News headlines are mixed. Analyst opinions are positive ("Buy"), but the low target price reflects some concern. The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.
*   **Recommendation:**  The data presents a mixed picture. While the financials are generally strong and analysts are positive, the recent poor performance, high risk, and negative expected return raise concerns. The "Hybrid Signal" recommending a full buy seems misaligned with the other negative indicators.
*   **In conclusion, further due diligence is required before investing in ADSK.**  The negative expected return, the stock's technical downtrend, and its underperformance relative to the S&P 500 suggest caution. The disconnect between the analyst "Buy" recommendation and the quantitative data should be carefully investigated.
