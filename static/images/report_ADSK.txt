**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has shown periods of strong growth, outperforming the S&P 500 in the past. However, recent performance has been significantly negative.  The high Market Risk Indicator, low RSI, negative PPO, and current price below moving averages suggest a bearish short-term outlook. Despite the projected long-term outperformance (146.6% expected return), the recent price decline and high market risk warrant caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent negative CAGR and clarification of the inconsistent earnings data are necessary before making any investment decisions.  A thorough fundamental analysis, considering factors beyond the provided data, is crucial before determining a suitable investment strategy.
