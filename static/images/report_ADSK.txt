## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that makes software products and services for architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, education, and entertainment.

The cumulative return of ADSK is 136.51%, while the cumulative return of the S&P 500 (VOO) is 118.37%.  The difference is 18.14%, indicating ADSK outperformed VOO.  Considering the provided historical range of the relative divergence (max: 178.4, min: -27.9), ADSK's current relative divergence of 22.3% suggests it's performing relatively well compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, but not exceptionally so.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in several periods, but also significant negative returns in others, highlighting the volatility inherent in the stock.  The consistently high Beta (around 63) indicates high sensitivity to market movements. The Alpha, while consistently positive, is relatively small (around 0.1), suggesting that the outperformance is not entirely due to superior stock picking but partly due to market-related factors.  The high Beta also amplifies both gains and losses.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $291.45
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $288.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $293.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $298.55

The price is slightly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price increase of $0.47 from the previous close shows a slight upward momentum, but the fact that the price remains below the longer-term moving averages suggests that the upward trend may not be sustained yet.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.87 -  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0974 - Suggests a bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 - Indicates a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 92.9% - This is a high projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, assuming consistent outperformance.  It is crucial to note that this is a projection and not a guarantee. The recent small upward price movement reflects a short-term gain, not a definitive confirmation of long-term projections.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and Revenue.  While there was growth in Q3 2024, recent quarters demonstrate inconsistency.  There appears to be a duplication of data for December 2024. This inconsistency needs clarification. Further analysis is limited without verified, complete data.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | $1.57B       |
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31 | $1.50B       |
| 2024-06-10 | 1.17 | $1.42B       |
| 2023-12-04 | 1.13 | $1.41B       |
| **2024-12-03** | **1.13** | **$1.41B** |  *Duplicate Data?*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows high profit margins consistently above 90%, indicating strong profitability. However, a significant drop in Equity and ROE from Q2 2023 to Q2 2024 is notable, warranting further investigation into potential underlying factors.

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE     |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|---------|
| 2024-10-31  | $1.57B  | 90.64%        | $2.62B | 10.51%  |
| 2024-07-31  | $1.50B  | 90.70%        | $2.47B | 11.40%  |
| 2023-10-31  | $1.41B  | 91.02%        | $1.48B | 16.26%  |
| 2023-07-31  | $1.34B  | 90.56%        | $1.21B | 18.41%  |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, as evidenced by a significantly higher cumulative return. However, high volatility (reflected in the Beta and MDD) is a key risk factor.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term downtrend, despite a slightly positive recent price movement.  Technical indicators point towards a potentially oversold market, but bearish momentum remains a concern.  The high projected long-term return is enticing, but needs careful consideration of the significant volatility inherent in the stock.  Inconsistent recent earnings data and a significant decrease in equity and ROE from Q2 2023 to Q2 2024 require further investigation before making any investment decisions.  The high projected return should be considered alongside the inherent risks before making a decision.
