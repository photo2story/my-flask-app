**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term bearish trend.  While the RSI indicates oversold conditions, the negative PPO and relative divergence suggest caution.  The company’s financial statements show consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  The long-term projected excess return should be considered with substantial caution due to its inherent uncertainty. More detailed analysis of the earnings data and ROE trends is necessary for a more comprehensive evaluation. A thorough review of the company's fundamentals, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is recommended before making any investment decisions.
