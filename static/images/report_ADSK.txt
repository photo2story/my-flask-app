* **5-Day Moving Average:** $306.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $296.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $301.10

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent increase of $0.448458 in price suggests a positive momentum, but this needs to be considered relative to historical price fluctuations.

* **RSI:** 79.53  (High RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback.)
* **PPO:** 0.7451 (Positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +5.2 (Short-term upward trend based on relative divergence)
* **Expected Return (vs S&P 500 over 2+ years):** 61.4% (This represents a significant outperformance expectation, however, the reliability of this projection needs careful consideration of the assumptions made in the model)

The high RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought and due for a correction. While the PPO is positive, the combined indicators warrant caution.  The recent price increase should be interpreted in this context.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |

| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | $1.41 B        |

There's a discrepancy in the data; 2024-12-03 is listed twice.  Assuming this is an error, recent earnings show relatively stable revenue and EPS, with slight fluctuations.  Further analysis is required to assess the underlying trend and understand the reasons behind the fluctuations.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has shown strong growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term but also demonstrating substantial volatility.  While recent price action and some indicators (like PPO) suggest positive short-term momentum, the high RSI signals potential for a near-term correction.  The inconsistent performance as measured by Alpha and Beta suggests that ADSK is a volatile stock whose long term prospects are uncertain.  Earnings are relatively stable, but further investigation is needed to fully understand the financial health and future outlook.  The projected long-term expected return requires detailed review of the assumptions that were made in generating it.  A long-term investment strategy should acknowledge the inherent volatility of ADSK.  Further due diligence and a deeper dive into company-specific factors are highly recommended before making any investment decisions.
