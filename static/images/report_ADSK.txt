The recent price action shows a pullback from recent highs, with indicators suggesting bearish momentum in the short term. However, the long-term outlook, based on the high expected return and historical outperformance, remains positive.  This requires caution, as past performance does not guarantee future results.  The provided financial information demonstrates strong financial health, although a recent drop in ROE warrants deeper analysis. A comprehensive analysis requires additional data, including news, analyst opinions, and a breakdown of the expected return calculation.

**8.  Recommendation:**

Further investigation is required to ascertain the complete picture. While the long-term outlook appears positive based on historical data and projected return, the current short-term indicators are bearish. A detailed analysis of the expected return calculation, recent news impacting the company, and further financial analysis are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions. The provided data presents a nuanced picture requiring additional context.
