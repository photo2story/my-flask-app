*   Equity has been increasing.
*   ROE (Return on Equity) is volatile, but generally healthy.  There was a dip in 2025-04-30, but it has since recovered.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

Autodesk presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Factors:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high maximum drawdowns, and a shockingly negative expected return are serious concerns. Beta increasing is a concern.
*   **Positive Factors:** Strong revenue growth, very high profit margins, generally healthy ROE, and a "Buy" consensus from analysts offer reasons for optimism. Recent news suggests potential positive catalysts in the construction cloud business.
*   **Neutral/Mixed Factors:** Technical indicators are not strongly pointing in either direction. The fluctuating EPS numbers create some concern.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this data, a potential investment in Autodesk carries considerable risk. The underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the negative expected return cannot be ignored. However, the company's strong revenue growth, profitability, and analyst optimism suggest that a turnaround is possible.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, further investigation is warranted before making an investment decision. Investors should:

*   **Investigate the reason for the negative expected return.** This is the most significant red flag.
*   **Monitor future earnings reports and revenue growth.** Continued positive trends would be encouraging.
*   **Pay attention to news and analyst updates.** Watch for confirmation of the positive catalysts mentioned in the recent news.
*   **Assess your risk tolerance.** The high maximum drawdowns suggest that this stock may not be suitable for risk-averse investors.
