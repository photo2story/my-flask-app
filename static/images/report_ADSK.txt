The cumulative return of ADSK is 157.11%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 130.05%.  The difference is 27.1%, placing it at the 22.9th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a min/max range of -22.9% to 195.2%).  While this shows superior past performance,  it doesn't guarantee future outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows a highly variable alpha and beta, indicating significant sensitivity to market movements and inconsistent outperformance relative to the market.  The high beta suggests considerable market risk.  Further investigation into the drivers of these fluctuations would be beneficial.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $308.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $304.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $284.80

The stock price is currently trading below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, it is above the 60-day moving average. The gap between the last market price and the closing price may indicate volatility or a brief correction.  The substantial difference between the closing price and the shorter-term moving averages suggests a recent price drop.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 41.86  - Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce. However, it's not definitively in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.7986 - Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:**  `nan` indicates missing data and prevents meaningful analysis.
* **Expected Return:** 98.4% -  This represents a high potential long-term (2+ years) excess return compared to the S&P 500.  However, it is crucial to understand the basis and assumptions of this prediction.  High expected returns also often correlate with high levels of risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows:

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue has generally increased quarter over quarter, showing positive growth.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS has also generally increased, but there is some fluctuation.  There's a slight dip in EPS from 2024-06-10 to 2023-12-04 but it appears to improve again in 2024-09-03.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue consistently grows quarter-over-quarter.  Profit margins are high and generally stable, fluctuating within a narrow range.  The slight drop in the last quarter warrants further investigation to determine the underlying causes.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has increased significantly, reflecting strong financial health.  ROE (Return on Equity) shows a downward trend but remains notably high. The decline in ROE in the most recent quarter warrants further analysis to understand the contributing factors.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided for analysis.  Information regarding market outlook is also missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, its recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction.  Technical indicators offer a mixed signal.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the PPO indicates negative momentum.  Fundamental analysis reveals steady revenue and EPS growth, high profit margins, and increasing equity.   However, recent quarterly data shows slight softening in both profit margins and ROE that warrants further investigation. The lack of recent news and analyst sentiment prevents a fully comprehensive analysis.  The high expected return should be viewed cautiously due to the inherent risk associated with such projections, especially given the stock's significant beta.  More information (analyst estimates, recent news, and details about the expected return calculation) is needed for a more complete assessment.
