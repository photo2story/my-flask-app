2026-01-06 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) based on the data provided:

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Autodesk Inc. is a software company focused on design and make software for architecture, engineering, construction, media and entertainment industries.
*   **Return Rate Discrepancy:** ADSK's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed (6.73% vs. 91.00%).
*   **Divergence:** The current divergence between ADSK and VOO's performance is -84.3, sitting at the lowest end of its historical range relative to VOO.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   **CAGR Volatility:** ADSK's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is highly volatile, ranging from -101% to 100% over rolling 3-year periods. This indicates inconsistent growth.
    *   **MDD Concerns:**  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is relatively high, peaking at 48.3%, suggesting significant potential losses during downturns.
    *   **Alpha Performance:** While initially strong, Alpha (outperformance compared to the market) has turned sharply negative in recent periods, mirroring the poor CAGR performance.
    *   **Beta Consistency:** Beta remains relatively consistent, generally in the 1.2 to 1.7 range, indicating that ADSK's price movements are more volatile than the overall market (S&P 500).
    *   **Market Cap:** Market cap is fluctuating around $60B.

**Analysis:** ADSK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative Alpha and high MDD in recent periods suggest significant risk. The high Beta indicates that ADSK is more volatile than the market, magnifying both gains and losses.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** \$286.73
*   **Last Market Update:** Price: \$288.66, Previous Close: \$286.73, Change: \$0.67
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: \$296.84
    *   20-day SMA: \$298.72
    *   60-day SMA: \$300.95

**Analysis:** ADSK's current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. The last market update shows a slight increase in price, indicating a potential minor upward correction, but the broader trend appears bearish based on the moving averages.

**3) RSI, PPO Index & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 30.55 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.23 (Negative Momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" - suggests a strong buy signal based on the model's criteria, but considers it "Very Safe" due to MRI being at 0.90, which is approaching "High Investment Recommended".
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -2511.7% (Highly Negative)

**Analysis:** The RSI value suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, which could indicate a potential buying opportunity. However, the negative PPO reinforces the downward momentum. The recent decline in relative divergence further supports the short-term bearish outlook. Despite the buy recommendation from the Hybrid Signal, the overwhelmingly negative expected return warrants extreme caution. The large change in the last market update indicates recent volatility.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Railway Pension Investments Ltd Increases Stake:** Indicates institutional confidence, but the impact is difficult to gauge without knowing the size of the stake increase.
*   **Slower Growth & Flat Margins Concern:** Raises a red flag about ADSK's future performance, suggesting the stock's investment case may be weakening.
*   **Fundamentals Look Strong:** Contradicts the "slower growth" article, indicating differing perspectives on the company's health. It suggests the market might be undervaluing the stock.
*   **Stock Moves -4.50%:**  Reflects the recent price volatility and likely contributes to the negative sentiment.
*   **BTIG Initiates Buy Rating:**  Offers a positive counterpoint, with a target price of \$365, significantly higher than the current price.
*   **DV vs. ADSK:** Focuses on valuation, but the context of whether ADSK is a better or worse value is missing from the headline.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. While some reports highlight potential concerns (slower growth, price drops), others express optimism (institutional buying, buy rating). The conflicting narratives make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.56)
*   **Opinions:** 30 analysts
*   **Target Price:** \$366.13 (Average), \$460 (High), \$275 (Low)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No data on specific changes.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is positive, with a "Buy" rating and a significantly higher average target price than the current stock price. This suggests that analysts, on average, believe the stock is undervalued. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty. The absence of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the current trend in analyst sentiment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------- |
| 2025-11-26 | 1.61 | \$1.85B    |
| 2025-09-02 | 1.47 | \$1.76B    |
| 2025-05-29 | 0.71 | \$1.63B    |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | \$1.57B    |
| 2025-11-26 | 1.28 | \$1.57B    |

**Analysis:** EPS and revenue generally trend upward, with the most recent quarter showing strong performance. However, the repetition of the 2025-11-26 data point for 2024-12-03 raises a data integrity concern. Assuming the data is accurate (except for the repeated data point), the improving EPS and revenue figures suggest positive underlying business performance.

**6) Financial Information Analysis**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------- |
| 2025-10-31   | \$1.85B    | 91.10%        |
| 2025-07-31   | \$1.76B    | 90.98%        |
| 2025-04-30   | \$1.63B    | 90.20%        |
| 2025-01-31   | \$1.64B    | 90.60%        |
| 2024-10-31   | \$1.57B    | 90.64%        |

**Analysis:** Revenue is consistently growing, indicating strong sales performance. The extremely high profit margins (around 90%) are a significant positive, suggesting a strong competitive advantage and efficient cost management.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE    |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------- |
| 2025-10-31   | \$2.89B    | 11.86% |
| 2025-07-31   | \$2.71B    | 11.53% |
| 2025-04-30   | \$2.62B    | 5.81%  |
| 2025-01-31   | \$2.62B    | 11.56% |
| 2024-10-31   | \$2.62B    | 10.51% |

**Analysis:** Equity is increasing, reflecting growth in the company's net worth.  ROE (Return on Equity) is generally strong, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity to generate profits. The dip in ROE for the 2025-04-30 quarter should be investigated further, but the subsequent recovery is encouraging.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Overall, the data paints a mixed picture for Autodesk (ADSK):

*   **Negative Signals:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, recent negative Alpha, high MDD, negative expected return, short-term downward price trend, and concerns about slowing growth.
*   **Positive Signals:** Strong revenue growth, extremely high profit margins, increasing equity, generally strong ROE, positive analyst consensus (Buy rating), and potential oversold condition (RSI).
*   **Conflicting Signals:** Contradictory news headlines, and a "buy" rating recommendation from the hybrid system despite overwhelmingly negative expectations.
*   **Data Issues:**  The duplicated earnings data needs to be verified for accuracy.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in ADSK at this point is risky. While the company demonstrates strong fundamentals (revenue, margins, ROE), the significant underperformance, negative momentum, and concerns about future growth cannot be ignored. The analyst consensus and the model recommendation offer some hope, but the negative expected return and market sentiment suggest caution.

**Recommendation:**

*   **High-Risk Tolerance:** A small, speculative position might be considered, given the potential for a rebound based on the analyst target prices and the oversold RSI.
*   **Conservative Approach:** It would be prudent to wait for more consistent positive indicators (improving Alpha, positive price momentum, confirmation of growth prospects) before making a significant investment.
*   **Due Diligence:** Further investigate the reason for the negative expected return, and the conflicting reports in the news headlines. Verify the duplicated earnings data.
