**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant volatility in both CAGR and Alpha, indicating fluctuating market outperformance. Beta shows a relatively high sensitivity to market movements (particularly in the last couple of years), exceeding 1.0 which implies a riskier investment compared to the market.  The significant negative CAGRs in the recent years (2021-2025) are a major concern.  A deeper investigation into the reasons for these declines is warranted.

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue, but overall, it shows mostly stable revenues with slightly decreasing EPS in recent quarters.  The significant dip in EPS from 2024-09-03 to 2024-12-03 requires further investigation.  The data also contains a duplicate entry for 2024-12-03.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | $1.57 B        |

**5) Financial Information:**

The financial information shows consistently high profit margins, indicating strong profitability. However, there's a significant drop in equity from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025, which needs further explanation, and a sharp decrease in ROE in the same period.  The data also implies a need to look into reasons behind potentially inflated profit margins.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31  | $1.64B  | 90.60%        |
| 2024-10-31  | $1.57B  | 90.64%        |
| 2024-07-31  | $1.50B  | 90.70%        |
| 2023-10-31  | $1.41B  | 91.02%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE      |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| 2025-01-31  | $2.62B  | 11.56%   |
| 2024-10-31  | $2.62B  | 10.51%   |
| 2024-07-31  | $2.47B  | 11.40%   |
| 2023-10-31  | $1.48B  | 16.26%   |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

ADSK shows strong profitability and high profit margins, but recent performance has been volatile and has underperformed the S&P 500. The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity and risk.  The recent decline in CAGR, alongside the drop in Equity and ROE, and the fluctuating EPS, raises significant concerns.  Further investigation into the causes of these declines, as well as the very high profit margins, is crucial before making any investment decisions. The expected long-term return is significantly higher than the S&P 500; however, this should be viewed with caution given the recent negative trends.  A comprehensive analysis of the company's strategy and competitive landscape is needed to understand the potential causes behind the observed financial performance and whether the high expected return is sustainable.
