*   **5-day SMA:** 299.45
*   **20-day SMA:** 300.96
*   **60-day SMA:** 301.99

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly below its short-term (5-day) moving average, and all SMA values are close to each other, signaling a relatively stable price movement over the recent weeks. The slight decline (-0.56) from the previous close shows a minor downward trend.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 46.42
*   **PPO:** 0.08
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Invest 0.8% monthly.
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -1.6 (Negative Trend)
*   **Expected Return:** -1487.9%

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates a "High Investment Recommended" zone, while the RSI (46.42) is close to neutral, neither overbought nor oversold. The PPO (0.08) is near zero, suggesting very little momentum. The hybrid signal suggests allocating the entire portfolio in the stock. However, the recent relative divergence change shows a short-term decline, and the expected return is significantly negative, indicating a very unfavorable outlook. The small price change relative to the previous close suggests no recent dramatic price movements.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Marathon Asset Management Ltd Reduced ADSK Position:** This suggests a major investor has reduced its stake in the company, which could indicate concerns about future performance.
*   **Autodesk's 3-Year Return (61%):** While past performance isn't indicative of future results, this headline shows a positive historical perspective.
*   **Figma vs. Autodesk Comparison:** This suggests increased competition in the design software space.
*   **Baird Lifts Price Target:** This is a positive signal, suggesting analysts believe the stock is undervalued.
*   **Autodesk Stock Near Crucial Support:** This highlights a technical level to watch. A break below this support could lead to further declines.
*   **Autodesk (ADSK) Stock Moves -1.46%:** This refers to a small recent price decline.

**Analysis (News):**  The news presents a mixed picture.  While some analysts are optimistic (Baird's price target increase), a major investor reducing their position and increased competition (Figma) introduce uncertainty. The "crucial support" headline suggests a potentially vulnerable price level.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.56)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 366.13, High: 460.00, Low: 275.00

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and an average target price significantly higher than the current price (299.54). This suggests analysts anticipate price appreciation. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates varying opinions on the stock's potential. The Recent Rating Changes section is empty so no useful information can be determined.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue   |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-11-26 | 1.61 | 1.85 B$   |

| 2025-11-26 | 1.28 | 1.57 B$   |

**Analysis:** Revenue and EPS are showing an upward trend in the most recent quarters, with a notable jump in EPS in the latest report (2025-11-26). This suggests improved profitability and financial performance. There is an error where 2 of the dates are the same (2025-11-26). It might be intended to be a different date (ex. 2025-02-26, 2024-02-26, 2026-11-26), so should be confirmed.

| 2024-10-31 | $2.62B    | 10.51%|

**Analysis:** The company is generating very high profit margins (above 90%), and revenue is consistently growing. Equity is also increasing steadily. ROE is volatile, dropping significantly in 2025-04-30, but has since recovered and is trending upwards.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Autodesk's (ADSK) recent performance is a mixed bag. While its financial fundamentals appear strong with growing revenue, very high profit margins, and increasing equity, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the past.  The analyst consensus is positive with a "Buy" rating and a higher target price.

However, there are considerable concerns.  The high negative expected return (-1487.9%) suggests potential for continued underperformance in the future. The increasing beta signals a stronger correlation with market risk.  The news is a mix of positive (analyst upgrades) and negative (major investor reducing position, competition from Figma). The technical indicators (RSI, PPO) currently offer little directional insight. The negative change in relative divergence suggests short-term downward pressure.

**Overall Recommendation:** Based on the information provided, the stock appears risky. While analysts have a "Buy" rating, the underperformance relative to the market and a highly negative expected return should not be ignored. The negative relative divergence change indicates short-term downside. The stock might be suitable for aggressive investors looking for a turnaround story, but not for risk-averse investors. A more in-depth review of the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape would be necessary before making an investment decision.
