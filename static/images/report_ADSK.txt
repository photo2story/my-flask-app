The table shows significant volatility in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown), indicating high risk.  Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance (positive alpha) and underperformance (negative alpha) relative to the benchmark.  Beta, generally above 1, shows ADSK is more volatile than the market.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $260.99
* **20-day Moving Average:** $261.635
* **60-day Moving Average:** $278.1788

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend, but below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The recent price increase of $1.78 (1.78%) suggests a minor upward correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.53 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.)

* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -2.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 211.2%  (This high expected return needs significant qualification.  It needs context such as the risk tolerance, the investment strategy, and assumptions about market behavior over the 2-year timeframe. An exceptionally high return like this suggests considerable risk or unrealistic assumptions.)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK shows a mixed performance.  While revenue and profitability are strong, the stock's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, although not dramatically within its historical context.  High volatility (indicated by beta and MDD) is a key risk factor.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially bullish short-term trend, but the longer-term outlook is less clear.  The projected high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution due to the inherent risks and potentially unrealistic assumptions.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data and the extraordinarily high projected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects is necessary for a complete assessment.
