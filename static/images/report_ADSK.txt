Autodesk presents a mixed picture. The company has strong fundamentals, with increasing revenue, exceptionally high profit margins, and solid ROE. Analysts have a positive outlook, with a "Buy" consensus and a target price significantly above the current level. Recent news highlights potential for AI monetization.
