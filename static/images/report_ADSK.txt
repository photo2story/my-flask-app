* **5-Day Moving Average:** $259.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $259.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $274.85

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.26 from the previous close indicates a minor upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.06 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)

* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.2 (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 142.5% (This is a high expected return compared to the S&P 500.  However, the accuracy of this projection needs to be carefully considered given the recent volatile performance).

The recent price increase of $1.26 is not significant enough to be considered a rapid surge.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings data shows some inconsistencies. There are duplicate entries for 2024-12-03. Revenue is relatively stable, but EPS shows fluctuation. Further analysis is needed to determine the trend and potential causes for the variance.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | $1.57 B     |
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31 | $1.50 B     |
| 2024-06-10 | 1.17 | $1.42 B     |
| 2023-12-04 | 1.13 | $1.41 B     |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | $1.41 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable with high profit margins consistently above 90%. However, equity and ROE show significant volatility. The drop in equity and ROE from 2024-07-31 to 2023-10-31 warrants further investigation.

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $1.64B | 90.60% |
| 2024-10-31 | $1.57B | 90.64% |
| 2024-07-31 | $1.50B | 90.70% |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.41B | 91.02% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-01-31 | $2.62B | 11.56% |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.62B | 10.51% |
| 2024-07-31 | $2.47B | 11.40% |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.48B | 16.26% |



**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK shows a mixed performance. While historical CAGR is strong and profit margins are high, recent performance has been weak, characterized by high negative returns and substantial drawdown.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity. The expected return of 142.5% over two years is ambitious and requires cautious interpretation due to the inherent risks and recent volatility.  Further investigation is needed to understand the causes of the recent underperformance and the volatility in equity and ROE.  More comprehensive financial statement analysis and consideration of macroeconomic factors would be needed for a thorough assessment.  The data provided suggests a higher-than-average risk profile.
