2025-12-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Autodesk (ADSK) based on the provided data.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Company Overview:** Autodesk Inc. provides software for architecture, engineering, construction, design, manufacturing, and entertainment industries.
*   **ADSK Cumulative Return:** 25.30%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -75.6 (Relative Divergence: 1.8)

**Analysis:**  ADSK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the specified period. The negative divergence indicates ADSK's return is considerably lower than the benchmark. The relative divergence of 1.8 suggests the current divergence is near its historical minimum, meaning it has rarely been this far below the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017 | 60.0%  | 67.4% | 32.0%  | 0.1  | 22.1   |
| 2016-2018 | 43.0%  | 74.4% | 28.0%  | 0.0  | 27.2   |
| 2017-2019 | 53.0%  | 74.4% | 31.0%  | 0.3  | 38.8   |
| 2018-2020 | 118.0% | 76.8% | 95.0%  | 0.3  | 64.5   |
| 2019-2021 | 77.0%  | 76.8% | 30.0%  | 0.5  | 59.4   |
| 2020-2022 | -72.0% | 82.6% | -71.0% | 0.7  | 39.5   |
| 2021-2023 | -119.0%| 82.6% | -120.0%| 1.0  | 51.4   |
| 2022-2024 | -52.0% | 82.6% | -72.0% | 1.0  | 62.4   |
| 2023-2025 | -17.0% | 81.2% | -82.0% | 1.4  | 63.4   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates wildly, showing periods of high growth followed by significant declines. The recent periods have been negative.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Historically positive, indicating outperformance relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark. However, recent Alphas are sharply negative, reflecting significant underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Relatively low, suggesting ADSK is less sensitive to market movements than the overall market *but* Beta has been increasing and is now at 1.4 in 2023-2025, so it has become more sensitive to market movements than the market itself. This is concerning, given the recent negative Alpha.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has been increasing, but at a slowing rate.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 300.08
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 297.58, Previous Close: 300.47, Change: -0.96
*   **5-day SMA:** 296.12
*   **20-day SMA:** 299.41
*   **60-day SMA:** 303.93

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 60-day moving average but slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages. This *could* suggest a short-term upward trend *within* a longer-term downtrend or consolidation phase. The negative change in the last market data suggests continued downward pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 45.27 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.08 (Slightly negative, indicating a potential downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00). This is a conflicting signal, given the other data points. The MRI in the hybrid signal is higher than the general MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 0.8 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Last Market Change:** -0.96 (Reflects Fluctuation)
*   **Expected Return:** -797.7% (Extremely negative, indicating very poor projected future performance compared to S&P 500).

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation *on its own*. However, the very negative expected return, the negative PPO, and the underperformance compared to the S&P 500 raise significant concerns. The "short-term increase" needs to be viewed with caution given the overall negative outlook. The large single-day change reflects volatility.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Headlines:** Several articles highlight BTIG's positive outlook, citing expanding TAM (Total Addressable Market) and margin upside for Autodesk.
*   **Neutral/Informative Headlines:** Articles discuss Autodesk's share price and OFI Invest Asset Management's acquisition of shares.
*   **Negative/Cautionary Headlines:** "Autodesk: Looking Back At The Past 3 Years" on Seeking Alpha might suggest a more critical analysis, potentially highlighting past issues.

**Analysis:**  The news is a mix of positive analyst opinions and more neutral information. The BTIG reports are a positive sign, but it's crucial to examine the reasoning behind their optimism. The Seeking Alpha article warrants further investigation to understand the potential concerns raised. The sheer number of articles on the same day (Dec 23rd) suggests some sort of analyst day or major report release.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.56)
*   **Target Price:** 366.13 (Avg) / 460.00 (High) / 275.00 (Low)

**Analysis:**  Analysts are generally positive on ADSK, with a "Buy" consensus and a target price significantly above the current price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty and differing opinions. The recent rating changes, if available, are a key thing to monitor.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue  |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-11-26 | 1.61 | 1.85 B$  |
| 2025-09-02 | 1.47 | 1.76 B$  |
| 2025-05-29 | 0.71 | 1.63 B$  |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | 1.57 B$  |
| 2025-11-26 | 1.28 | 1.57 B$  |

**Analysis:** EPS and Revenue generally show an increasing trend, but with some variability. The most recent EPS of 1.61 and Revenue of 1.85B look positive. However, the re-listing of older 2024 data skews the analysis. The 2025-05-29 EPS number of 0.71 seems unusually low.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Shows a clear upward trend.
*   **Profit Margin:** Extremely high and relatively stable, indicating strong pricing power.
*   **Equity:** Growing, which is positive.
*   **ROE:** Fluctuates, with a significant dip in 2025-04-30. The ROE bounced back in the latest quarter.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Underperformance:** ADSK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Volatile Performance:** The Alpha/Beta analysis shows a history of high growth, but also high risk (MDD) and recent sharp declines. While Alpha used to be positive, indicating ADSK outperforming its risk adjusted benchmark, more recent Alphas have dropped significantly into the negative, which suggests there are changes in the company that makes investors less confident. Furthermore, the Beta has been increasing from 0.1 to 1.4, this suggests that the stock has become more reactive to the market movement, in other words more risky.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** The technical indicators are mixed. The MRI suggests a medium investment, but the negative expected return is a major red flag. The SMA analysis suggest short-term upward momentum is in place.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Reality:** Analysts have a "Buy" rating and high target prices, which contrasts with the negative expected return and underperformance. This discrepancy requires careful consideration.
*   **Financial Strength:** Revenue and profit margins are strong, but ROE is volatile.
*   **News Sentiment:** Mixed, with positive analyst reports but also cautionary articles.
*   **Conclusion:**

    The data presents a mixed picture for Autodesk. While the company exhibits strong financial performance in terms of revenue and profitability, its stock has significantly underperformed the market, and future expectations are extremely negative. The conflicting signals from technical indicators and analyst opinions suggest significant uncertainty.

    **Recommendation:** Exercise extreme caution. Before investing, it's crucial to:
    *   Thoroughly investigate the reasons behind the negative expected return.
    *   Understand the concerns raised in the Seeking Alpha article.
    *   Assess the sustainability of the high profit margins.
    *   Monitor upcoming earnings reports and analyst rating changes.
    *   Determine why the ADSK's stock return rate is not performing as well as its business financials
    *   In short, further in-depth due diligence is needed to align why there is a divergence between business financials and the company's stock value.
