## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Stock Review

**0) Overview:** Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that develops and sells computer-aided design (CAD) software, and other software products and services.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

ADSK's cumulative return (70.44%) underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (91.19%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -20.8%, placing it at the 11th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on a range of -44.5% to 171.7%.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant variability in ADSK's performance relative to the market (Beta) and excess returns (Alpha) over different time periods.  Early years (2015-2021) exhibited high CAGR and positive alpha, suggesting outperformance. However, the subsequent years (2021-2025) show negative or very low CAGR and high beta, indicative of significant market sensitivity and underperformance.  The increasing Alpha values in recent years, despite negative CAGR, may reflect increased market volatility affecting Beta and overall returns. The large swings in CAGR, MDD (Maximum Drawdown), and Beta highlight the risk associated with investing in ADSK.  Note that market capitalization (Cap(B)) increased substantially during the analyzed period.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $269.81
* **Last Market Price:** $260.30 (down $0.51 from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $270.11
* **20-day Moving Average:** $263.04
* **60-day Moving Average:** $285.57

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The recent slight drop may indicate some short-term selling pressure.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 59.57 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** +0.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (long-term, 2+ years):** 55.6% above S&P 500.  This is a substantial claim requiring further justification and should be treated cautiously.  The recent price drop (-0.51) is not significant enough to suggest a major reversal.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some volatility. While revenue has generally trended upwards, EPS fluctuates slightly quarter to quarter. More data and analysis are needed to establish reliable trends.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | 1.57 B$     |
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31 | 1.50 B$     |

| 2023-12-04 | 1.13 | 1.41 B$     |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | 1.41 B$     | *(Note: Duplicate entry)*


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows a steady increase, and profit margins are consistently high (above 90%).  Equity increased significantly from Q4 2023 to Q1 2025, while ROE shows some fluctuation, possibly reflecting changes in profitability and investment strategies.  The drop in ROE from 16.26% in Q4 2023 to 11.56% in Q1 2025 deserves further investigation.

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE    |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|--------|
| 2025-01-31 | $1.64B   | 90.60%         | $2.62B  | 11.56% |
| 2024-10-31 | $1.57B   | 90.64%         | $2.62B  | 10.51% |
| 2024-07-31 | $1.50B   | 90.70%         | $2.47B  | 11.40% |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.41B   | 91.02%         | $1.48B  | 16.26% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

ADSK shows a mixed picture. While it demonstrates strong revenue growth and high profit margins, its stock performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 in recent periods, indicated by negative CAGR and a high beta in certain periods.  Technical indicators suggest a relatively neutral position, but the data should be interpreted within the context of the significant volatility shown in the CAGR and MDD data. The projected long-term outperformance requires more detailed supporting evidence.  Further research into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the fluctuations in ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data has some inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) that needs to be clarified.
