**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $285.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $291.20
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $301.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $299.60

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The small positive daily change (0.09%) is insignificant compared to the larger trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 32.12 (Suggests the stock is oversold, but it's important to note RSI is not a standalone indicator and should be used in conjunction with other analysis.)
* **PPO:** -0.79 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.6% (Indicates recent short-term weakening relative to the market)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 99.2% (This is a significant outperformance expectation compared to the VOO; however, its reliability depends on the model's accuracy and underlying assumptions)

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence change points towards bearish sentiment.  The high expected return should be treated with caution given market volatility.  The small daily price increase doesn't contradict the overall bearish trend indicated by the technical indicators.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28  | $1.57 B      |

| 2024-12-03 | 1.13  | $1.41 B      | *(Duplicate entry - likely an error in the data)*


Revenue shows slight growth, however EPS is inconsistent, requiring further analysis to understand the drivers of profitability.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but current technical indicators (RSI, PPO, relative divergence) suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  While the company shows revenue growth and high profit margins, the recent decline in ROE and inconsistent EPS warrant further investigation.  The high projected long-term return should be viewed cautiously given the current market sentiment and the volatility demonstrated in historical data.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the fluctuating EPS and declining ROE is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) also require clarification before making any investment decisions.
