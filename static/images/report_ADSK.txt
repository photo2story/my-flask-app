* **5-Day Moving Average:** $255.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $261.3655
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $278.614

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent price increase of $0.87  suggests a modest upturn.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.45 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)

The high MRI suggests caution. While the RSI is close to oversold territory, it isn't decisively so. The PPO indicates a positive momentum, but it's mild.  The high projected excess return must be viewed with skepticism due to its reliance on future predictions.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK shows a history of strong growth, but it's also volatile. While current performance lags behind the S&P 500, this underperformance is within the range of historical fluctuations. The company demonstrates healthy revenue growth and high profit margins. However,  the high beta suggests significant market risk.  The high projected long-term excess return requires further investigation and should be treated cautiously.  Further research into the duplicate earnings data entry and deeper analysis of the recent ROE decline are necessary. Investors should consider these factors before making any investment decisions.  The high risk indicated by the MRI should not be overlooked.
