### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 300.25
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 300.2, Previous Close: 300.86, Change: -0.22
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 300.616
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 305.4753
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 308.2962

**Analysis:** ADSK is currently trading below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 days). This suggests a short-term and medium-term downtrend. The slight negative change from the previous close indicates continued downward pressure.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 45.19 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.2006 (Slightly negative, indicating a potential downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3 (Negative, suggesting a recent decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1180.0 (Very Negative - significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 is projected)

**Analysis:**  The MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" level, which seems contradictory given the other indicators. The RSI is neutral, the PPO is slightly negative, and the recent divergence change is also negative. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, but this might be overly optimistic given the very negative expected return.  The large negative expected return should be a significant cause for concern. While the MRI might indicate broader market optimism, ADSK-specific factors are clearly weighing down its potential.

### 7. 종합 Analysis (Summary)

Autodesk (ADSK) presents a mixed investment picture.

*   **Negative Factors:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, a recent downtrend in price, negative short-term indicators (PPO, divergence), and a very negative projected return. High historical volatility (MDD) and increasing market correlation (Beta) amplify risk.
*   **Positive Factors:**  Strong analyst consensus ("Buy"), potential for upside based on average target price, extremely high and consistent profit margins, and recent improvements in EPS and revenue (though inconsistent).
*   **Key Considerations:**  The upcoming earnings call is crucial. Investors should carefully evaluate the earnings report and management's guidance. It is imperative to understand the reasons for the company's recent underperformance and assess whether there are concrete plans to address these issues.

**Conclusion:** While analyst opinions and strong profit margins offer some optimism, the significant underperformance, negative short-term indicators, and very negative projected return should give investors pause. A cautious approach is warranted, closely monitoring the company's performance and the upcoming earnings report. The conflicting MRI signal makes it less reliable as an indicator in this particular case.
