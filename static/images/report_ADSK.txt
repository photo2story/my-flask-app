## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that makes software for various industries, including architecture, engineering, and media.

The cumulative return for ADSK is 131.13%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 112.47%.  Therefore, ADSK outperformed VOO by **18.66 percentage points** as of the last data point.  The relative divergence (18.7) indicates ADSK's performance is above average compared to its historical performance relative to the VOO, but not exceptionally high considering the maximum divergence recorded.

The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market (beta varies significantly, reflecting the company's changing market sensitivity over time).  The high CAGR values (especially in 2018-2020) point to periods of strong growth, though the significant negative CAGR in recent years (-62% and -85%) highlights periods of substantial underperformance.  The high maximum drawdowns (MDD) also reveal considerable risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $284.82
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $289.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $296.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $298.60

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (38.36):** Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.46):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence (-1.7):**  Shows a short-term downward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.

The expected return of 92.6% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500,  while optimistic, should be viewed cautiously given the recent underperformance and volatility indicated by the provided data.  The current price ($284.82) is below recent moving averages, which does not signal an imminent rapid rebound.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-12-03).  Assuming the duplicate is an error, the data shows a slight decline in EPS and revenue in recent quarters.  Further analysis requires a more complete and consistent dataset.  A more detailed analysis would require looking at the specific drivers behind these numbers.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows steady growth but profit margins have slightly decreased recently. This warrants further investigation into the reasons for the margin compression.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is growing, but ROE has significantly decreased in the last two quarters. This again points to a need to understand the underlying reasons for this change in profitability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has historically shown strong growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 in certain periods. However, recent performance has been significantly weaker, with negative CAGRs and high maximum drawdowns.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term rebound, but the negative PPO and relative divergence signal bearish momentum.  The decline in ROE and profit margins raises concerns about the company's profitability. The expected long-term return should be considered with caution, given the recent volatility and financial trends.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent underperformance, including competitive pressures and macroeconomic factors, is necessary before forming a strong investment opinion.
