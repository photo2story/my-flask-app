2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Autodesk (ADSK) stock data you provided, along with analysis:

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Autodesk Inc Overview:** A software company that makes software products and services for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries.
*   **ADSK Cumulative Return:** 25.08%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -77.1 (Relative Divergence: 1.1)

**Analysis:** ADSK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period covered.  The divergence is large, and the very low relative divergence of 1.1 suggests that the underperformance is near its worst point relative to its past performance. The CAGR seems incorrect based on the cumulative return.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ------ |
| 2024-2026 | 33.0% | 82.6% | -73.0% | 0.1  | 63.4   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 33.0% is high, but it doesn't align with the cumulative return data provided.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 82.6% is extremely high, indicating a very volatile period for the stock. This means that from peak to trough, the stock lost over 80% of its value.
*   **Alpha:** -73.0% suggests ADSK significantly underperformed its benchmark, considering risk-adjusted returns.
*   **Beta:** 0.1 indicates ADSK is significantly less volatile than the overall market. This contradicts the high MDD.
*   **Cap (B):** Market capitalization of 63.4 Billion.

**In summary:** This alpha/beta information suggests that the company has not been providing a return rate to the market, and is a low volatility stock.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 299.54
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 297.65
    *   Previous Close: 299.54
    *   Change: -0.63
*   **5-day SMA:** 299.45
*   **20-day SMA:** 300.96
*   **60-day SMA:** 301.99

**Analysis:** The stock price has been relatively stable in the short term. The price is slightly below all three moving averages, which could suggest a minor downward trend. The recent change of -0.63 is not large, indicating no sharp rebound or decline.

**3) Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 46.42
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.08
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1363.3 (Expected negative excess return compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests a medium-risk investment opportunity based on overall market conditions.
*   **RSI:** RSI of 46.42 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** PPO of 0.08 indicates a buy signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "Buy" signal but to buy only 3 shares is odd, and the analysis calls this a "very safe" allocation.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence confirms the short-term underperformance against the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is very concerning, suggesting the model predicts significant future underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
