## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) is a multinational software corporation that develops and sells 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software.

The cumulative return of ADSK is 147.86%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.40%.  The difference is 27.5%, placing it at the 26.8th percentile of its historical outperformance range (-27.8% to 178.5%).  While it has outperformed the S&P 500, it's important to note the relative outperformance is not consistently high over the observation period.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high beta values (23-66), indicating high sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha values are consistently low (around 0.1), suggesting that the outperformance is mainly driven by market beta rather than stock-specific factors.  The significant negative CAGR in 2020-2023 highlights the risk associated with this high beta.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $303.99 (Last Market: $306.62)
* **5-day moving average:** $305.93
* **20-day moving average:** $306.28
* **60-day moving average:** $289.99

The price is slightly below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a minor short-term pullback.  It is also significantly above its 60-day moving average. The difference between the last market price and the closing price suggests a slight downward correction since the last market close.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 49.13 - Near the neutral level, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** -0.35 - Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** +2.2 - Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 56.5% - This is a high expected return over a long-term (2+ years) horizon, exceeding the S&P 500. However, this should be viewed with caution, as it's based on past performance which doesn't guarantee future results.  The high beta of ADSK emphasizes that this high expected return is accompanied by considerable risk.  A price of $306.62, if significantly higher than recent prices, might point to a sharp upward correction or a brief period of rapid price appreciation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, primarily driven by market beta. However, the recent performance and financial data show some fluctuations in profitability and high risk as evidenced by high beta and negative CAGR in 2020-2023.

Additional information on current news and analyst opinions is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.  The data suggests a generally positive trend but with periods of significant volatility.  More data is required for a conclusive assessment.
