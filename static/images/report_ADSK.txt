There appears to be a duplicate entry for December 2024.  Excluding the duplicate, revenue shows a slight upward trend, but EPS fluctuates.  Further analysis is needed to assess the underlying drivers of this fluctuation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Autodesk (ADSK) shows signs of both strength and weakness.  While recent earnings indicate revenue growth and high profit margins, the stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 in the recent past and shows signs of a short-term downtrend.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The high projected long-term return is promising but should be interpreted with caution due to the high beta and recent volatility.  Further investigation into the reasons for fluctuating EPS and the ROE drop is crucial. A thorough fundamental analysis, considering industry trends and competitive pressures, is necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.  The high expected return warrants careful consideration of the associated risks, particularly given the high beta observed in the historical data.
