**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating Alpha and Beta values across different years.  While Alpha generally indicates outperformance (positive values), the high Beta values suggest significant market sensitivity (volatility).  The negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlights periods of substantial underperformance.  The recent positive CAGR shows a recovery.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 66.0% | 17.6% | 38.0% | 0.1 | 22.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 86.0% | 16.4% | 67.0% | 0.2 | 27.3 |
| 2017-2019  | 78.0% | 16.4% | 48.0% | 0.6 | 38.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 155.0% | 17.7% | 128.0% | 0.2 | 64.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 79.0% | 19.6% | 8.0% | 0.2 | 59.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -62.0% | 19.6% | -71.0% | 0.2 | 39.6 |
| 2021-2023  | -85.0% | 19.6% | -108.0% | 1.2 | 51.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 1.0% | 17.9% | -32.0% | 1.3 | 62.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $306.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $306.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $296.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $301.10

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent minor downturn.  However, it remains above the 20-day moving average, indicating a relatively strong short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (79.53):**  Indicates the stock is currently in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction might be due.
* **PPO (0.74):** Shows positive momentum, but should be interpreted cautiously in conjunction with the high RSI.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+5.2):** Suggests recent short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (61.4%):**  A projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance of the S&P 500.  This should be viewed with skepticism, as it is an estimate and not guaranteed.  The recent price drop warrants caution.

The large negative price change (-1.67%) does indicate a slight and relatively sudden drop in price, but it doesn't qualify as a "sharp decline" in the context of the overall price history.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively consistent revenue, fluctuating between $1.40B and $1.57B across quarters.  EPS also demonstrates some fluctuation but has generally remained stable or slightly increasing.  There's an apparent duplication of data for 2024-12-03.  This inconsistency should be investigated for accuracy.


| 날짜      | EPS | 매출      |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | 1.57 B$   |
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31 | 1.50 B$   |
| 2024-06-10 | 1.17 | 1.42 B$   |
| 2023-12-04 | 1.13 | 1.41 B$   |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | 1.41 B$   |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profit Margins show consistent performance with slight fluctuations.  Equity and ROE show growth in the latest quarters though a decrease in ROE is observable in 2024, possibly related to increased investment. Further investigation is necessary to determine the reasons for this.


Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31  | $1.57B  | 90.64%        |
| 2024-07-31  | $1.50B  | 90.70%        |
| 2023-10-31  | $1.41B  | 91.02%        |
| 2023-07-31  | $1.34B  | 90.56%        |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE     |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| 2024-10-31  | $2.62B  | 10.51%  |
| 2024-07-31  | $2.47B  | 11.40%  |
| 2023-10-31  | $1.48B  | 16.26%  |
| 2023-07-31  | $1.21B  | 18.41%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but recent data reveals a slight downturn. While the long-term outlook based on expected returns is positive, the high RSI suggests potential near-term volatility. The company's financials indicate consistent revenue and profitability, though a decline in ROE should be investigated. Before making any investment decisions, further due diligence is essential, including addressing data inconsistencies and understanding the causes of the fluctuations in Alpha, Beta, and ROE. The current overbought condition (RSI) warrants caution in the short term.  A more comprehensive analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and competitive landscape, is recommended.
