This report analyzes Autodesk Inc. (ADSK), a leading provider of 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Autodesk's cumulative return (162.07%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (129.75%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 32.3%, placing it at the 25.3rd percentile of its historical relative performance range (max: 195.2%, min: -22.9%).  This suggests a strong relative performance, though past performance is not indicative of future results. The provided CAGR data shows significant variability in yearly performance, highlighting the inherent risk in technology stocks.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $298.96 (Last market: $304.14)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $299.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $305.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $286.29

The price is currently below its 20-day and significantly above its 60-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term weakness but longer-term strength.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price suggests a slight downward movement after market close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (43.14):**  Suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.90):**  Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:**  Shows a recent short-term downward trend (nan, represented as "-").
* **Expected Return (89.2%):** This represents a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years)  assuming continued current trends, which is a highly uncertain assumption.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-12-03).  Focusing solely on the unique entries:

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows a general upward trend, though growth is slowing slightly.
* **EPS:** EPS shows some fluctuation, with a slight dip in Q3 2024 followed by a slight increase in Q4 2024.  Without expectation data, it's impossible to determine whether these are beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue demonstrates consistent growth. Profit margins are high and relatively stable, though there's a slight downward trend in recent quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity is increasing, but ROE has decreased significantly in the last two quarters, potentially indicating a less efficient use of capital.  Further analysis would be needed to understand the underlying reasons for this decline.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last 2 days) or analyst opinions were provided.  Market outlook information is missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Autodesk shows strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but recent price action indicates short-term weakness.  While the long-term expected return is high (89.2%),  this is contingent upon numerous factors and should not be considered a guaranteed outcome. Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce, but bearish momentum is present.  Financial statements reveal consistent revenue growth but declining ROE, demanding further investigation into the factors driving this decrease.  The lack of recent news prevents a comprehensive assessment of current market sentiment.  Additional information is required for a complete and reliable investment decision.
