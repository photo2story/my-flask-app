## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) is a multinational software corporation that develops and sells 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software.

The cumulative return of ADSK is 144.12%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference is 21.96%.  The provided relative divergence of 24.2% indicates that ADSK's performance is near the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The historical data shows periods of strong outperformance and underperformance against the S&P 500, highlighting the volatility inherent in the stock.  The alpha consistently around 0.1 suggests a slight outperformance relative to the market, but the beta fluctuates significantly, indicating varying levels of market sensitivity over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $300.83
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $298.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $294.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $299.44

The price is slightly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, it's above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, implying some short-term support. The recent price change shows a minor decrease (-$0.08 or -0.03%).  This is not significant enough to classify as a sharp drop.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.38 (Slightly below neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.51 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.4 (Suggests short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 82.1% (This represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon of 2+ years)

The combination of indicators suggests a relatively positive outlook, although the RSI is not strongly bullish. The significant expected return is notable but should be considered in the context of the inherent risk.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, supported by consistent revenue growth and high profit margins. The recent performance has outpaced the S&P 500, and technical indicators suggest a positive outlook, although short-term volatility is expected given the high beta. The high expected return is enticing, but investors should carefully assess the risk involved, particularly given the company's sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and the reasons for the recent decline in ROE are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high profit margin and increasing revenue suggest long-term strength, but the high beta should be considered as a significant risk factor for investors.
