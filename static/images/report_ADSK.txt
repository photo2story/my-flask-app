The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This data is crucial for assessing the company's profitability and financial health.  Further investigation is needed to obtain this missing information.


**6. Overall Summary:**

ADSK has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong cumulative return.  However, this performance has been volatile, as evidenced by the significant swings in CAGR and MDD.  The recent price movement suggests a minor bearish trend in the short term, while technical indicators provide a mixed signal.  While a high expected return is projected, caution is warranted due to historical volatility and missing crucial financial data.  Further investigation into data quality, missing financial information, and a deeper dive into the drivers of alpha and beta is recommended before making investment decisions.  The high expected return should be viewed cautiously given the inherent uncertainty of future market behavior.
