2025-01-15 - Analysis Report
## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that makes software for architecture, engineering, construction, and manufacturing industries.

The cumulative return of ADSK is 132.79%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 112.74%.  This represents a difference of 20.0 percentage points.  Considering the provided historical range of differences (max: 178.4%, min: -27.9%), ADSK's current performance relative to the S&P 500 sits at the 23.2nd percentile.  This suggests that while ADSK has outperformed the S&P 500, it's not exceptionally far outside the historical range of performance differences.

The Alpha consistently sits around 0.1, indicating a modest outperformance relative to the market (Beta), which has fluctuated significantly between 23 and 66 over the years.  This high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  Note the dramatic drop in CAGR from 2020-2023, likely reflecting market corrections.  The recent uptick in CAGR (2023-2025) is encouraging but needs further observation.  The relatively low MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in recent years suggests resilience, despite the negative CAGR.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $286.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $288.77
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $295.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $298.56

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend or consolidation phase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 34.11 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce. However, it's not a strong buy signal on its own.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.43 –  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** +0.1 (20-day) – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 89.1% – This represents a significant expected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming consistent investment.  However, this projection needs to be viewed with caution, as such high expected returns are rarely guaranteed.  The high expected return might reflect the currently low RSI and the potential for future growth.  Further due diligence is recommended.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue        |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-12-03 | $1.28 | $1.57 Billion  |
| 2024-09-03 | $1.31 | $1.50 Billion  |
| 2024-06-10 | $1.17 | $1.42 Billion  |
| 2023-12-04 | $1.13 | $1.41 Billion  |
| 2024-12-03 | $1.13 | $1.41 Billion  | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


Revenue shows a general upward trend, although there are some minor fluctuations. EPS also displays some variability, but it's generally stable.  The duplicate entry at 2024-12-03 suggests a data error that requires correction for accurate analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $1.57 Billion | 90.64%       |
| 2024-07-31 | $1.50 Billion | 90.70%       |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.41 Billion | 91.02%       |
| 2023-07-31 | $1.34 Billion | 90.56%       |

Revenue is steadily increasing, demonstrating consistent growth. Profit margins are exceptionally high and consistently above 90%, suggesting strong operational efficiency and pricing power.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (Billion) | ROE (%) |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| 2024-10-31 | $2.62            | 10.51   |
| 2024-07-31 | $2.47            | 11.40   |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.48            | 16.26   |
| 2023-07-31 | $1.21            | 18.41   |

Equity is growing, indicating a healthy financial position. ROE has decreased, possibly due to increased investment or changes in capital structure. Further investigation is needed to understand this trend.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, although its current relative position is not exceptionally high compared to its historical range. While recent earnings show consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, the recent price movement suggests a potential short-term downward trend or consolidation.  Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) point towards a potentially oversold market, suggesting a possible bounce.  However, the high projected long-term return should be approached cautiously, requiring further independent verification and risk assessment. The high beta signifies significant market risk.  Further investigation into the reason for decreasing ROE is required.  The data inconsistency in the earnings report needs correction.


**8. Conclusion:**

ADSK presents a mixed picture.  While long-term prospects look promising based on the company's consistent revenue growth, high profit margins, and historically strong performance relative to the market, short-term price action and some financial metrics require closer scrutiny.  A deeper dive into the company's future growth plans, competitive landscape, and potential risks is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The projected 89.1% return should be treated as an optimistic projection, not a guarantee.  Independent research and professional financial advice are strongly recommended.
