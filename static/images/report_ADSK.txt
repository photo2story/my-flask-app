**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $301.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $296.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $301.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $295.27

The current price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent period of consolidation or slight downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.48 - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to the oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -0.41 -  Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 - Shows a recent decrease in relative strength against the S&P 500.

The provided expected return of 58.4% over a long-term (2+ years) horizon is very high and should be considered cautiously. This is a projected excess return compared to the S&P 500 and depends heavily on the underlying assumptions used in the calculation. It's crucial to understand the methodology used to derive this figure.  The current price of $301.23 does not show a dramatic recent surge or drop; hence, there is no evidence of a rapid price movement needing specific attention.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies: two entries for 2024-12-03.  Using only the unique entries, we observe:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has shown relatively consistent growth, albeit with minor fluctuations.
* **EPS:** EPS has shown some fluctuation, with a slight decrease in the last quarter.  No information on earnings expectations is provided to assess whether these results beat or missed projections.  A clearer picture requires additional data.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is steadily growing quarter-over-quarter. Profit margins are consistently high (above 90%) but have shown some slight fluctuation.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has seen significant growth. Return on Equity (ROE) has decreased in recent quarters, potentially indicating changes in profitability or capital structure. Further investigation is needed to understand the reason for the significant drop in ROE between Q3 2023 and Q4 2023.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions which is not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has demonstrated strong performance relative to the S&P 500 over the period considered in the analysis. However, recent performance shows some weakening relative to the benchmark.  Financial data shows consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, but fluctuating EPS and declining ROE raise some concerns.  Technical indicators suggest neutral to slightly bearish sentiment. The high projected long-term return needs further scrutiny and understanding of the underlying model.  Lack of recent news and analyst opinions restricts a complete picture of current market sentiment.  Further analysis is needed based on more complete and consistent data, including earnings expectations, recent news events, and analyst ratings.
