## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that develops and sells design software for various industries.  The cumulative return of ADSK is 156.0%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%. The difference is 27.1%, placing it at the 22.9th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max).  This suggests that while ADSK has outperformed the market, its current outperformance is not exceptionally high compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $290.64 (Last Market: $290.56)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $312.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $304.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $284.13

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential longer-term support.  The closing price being slightly above the last market price shows little significant movement on the last trading day.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (41.01):**  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.43):** A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-2.7):** Shows a recent slight decrease in relative outperformance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (98.4%):**  A significant expected return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is predicted.  This needs careful consideration; such high projected returns require further examination of the underlying assumptions.
* **Last Market price:** Since 290.56 is not significantly different than the closing price 290.64, there is no indication of a sharp price movement.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows consistent revenue and EPS growth, although the growth rate appears to be slowing.  The latest EPS of $1.31 and revenue of $1.50B are slightly higher than the previous quarters, and a comparison with analyst expectations would be beneficial for a complete assessment.  Profit margins are high and stable.  Further details on analyst expectations for upcoming quarters are needed to properly assess the outlook.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  The company demonstrates consistent revenue growth and consistently high profit margins (above 90%).
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Return on Equity (ROE) has shown some fluctuation, but generally remains strong. A full explanation of the N/A values is needed.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:**  The report lacks crucial information:  No recent news (within the last two days) from sources like Shacknews or similar financial news outlets is provided.  Information about analyst opinions, performance highlights from sources like FINBOLD, and details about earnings announcements are also missing. This significantly limits a comprehensive analysis.  Providing this information would allow a more accurate assessment of current market sentiment and risk.


**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary of 1-6):**

ADSK has shown strong historical performance compared to the S&P 500, but its recent relative performance has been weakening. While the company shows solid financial fundamentals with consistently high revenue and profit margins, the short-term technical indicators suggest caution. The RSI suggests oversold conditions, but the negative PPO and the movement below recent moving averages point to bearish momentum. The high expected return projection requires further scrutiny.  The absence of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a complete and accurate evaluation of the current market outlook and the validity of the predicted long-term return.  More information is needed before forming a definitive investment opinion.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the incomplete data, a definitive buy/sell/hold recommendation cannot be made.  Additional information, including:

* Recent news and analyst opinions.
* Analyst EPS and revenue estimates for upcoming quarters.
* Clarification on missing financial data ("N/A" values).
* Deeper analysis of the 98.4% expected return calculation.

is needed to make a well-informed investment decision.  Further investigation is strongly recommended before investing in ADSK.
