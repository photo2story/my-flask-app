Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), ADSK has underperformed slightly, with a cumulative return 3.84% lower than VOO as of the last data point.

| 2018-2020  | 184.0% | 70.5% | 159.0% | 0.2 | 66.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 112.0% | 70.5% | 57.0% | 0.2 | 61.4 |

| 2021-2023  | -140.0% | 72.0% | -157.0% | 0.9 | 53.2 |
| 2022-2024  | -73.0% | 72.0% | -90.0% | 1.0 | 64.6 |
| 2023-2025  | -35.0% | 73.5% | -48.0% | 0.9 | 56.1 |

The table shows significant volatility in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown), indicating high risk. Alpha values generally suggest outperformance over the benchmark (although negative in the last few years), while Beta values show varying levels of market sensitivity.  The high beta in recent years (above 0.9) suggests that ADSK's price movements are highly correlated with the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $256.92
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $249.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $261.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $279.65

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.85 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.0336 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -2.6 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 229.6% (This exceptionally high figure needs further justification and clarification.  A 229.6% outperformance over the S&P 500 over 2+ years is highly unlikely without specific supporting analysis.)

The recent price drop (-$2.51) is noticeable but doesn't necessarily signal a major crash.  However, the combination of indicators (negative PPO, RSI below 50, price below moving averages) suggests caution.  The high expected return requires significant validation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | $1.57B      |
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31 | $1.50B      |
| 2024-06-10 | 1.17 | $1.42B      |
| 2023-12-04 | 1.13 | $1.41B      |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | $1.41B      |

Note that there's a duplicate entry for 2024-12-03.  Assuming this is an error, revenue shows slight growth, while EPS fluctuates.  A more detailed analysis, including year-over-year comparisons and trend analysis, would be needed to draw stronger conclusions.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $1.64B | 90.60% |
| 2024-10-31 | $1.57B | 90.64% |
| 2024-07-31 | $1.50B | 90.70% |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.41B | 91.02% |

Revenue shows consistent growth. Profit margins are high and relatively stable, suggesting strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-01-31 | $2.62B | 11.56% |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.62B | 10.51% |
| 2024-07-31 | $2.47B | 11.40% |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.48B | 16.26% |

Equity shows growth except for a slight dip in 2024 Q3. ROE is relatively stable but lower than in 2023 Q4, possibly due to increased equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK shows a mixed picture. While revenue and profitability are strong, the recent price performance has lagged the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend, although the RSI is not definitively oversold.  The high expected return requires further substantiation.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the current price represents a buying opportunity.  A deeper dive into the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The unusually high long-term expected return should be scrutinized critically and should be backed by detailed financial modeling.
