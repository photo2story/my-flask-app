*   **Overall Assessment:**

    Autodesk presents a mixed picture.  While the company demonstrates strong financial performance in terms of revenue growth and profit margins, its stock has significantly underperformed the market. The negative Alpha and extremely negative expected return raise concerns about its future potential relative to the S&P 500.  Analyst opinions are generally positive, but the historical volatility and recent underperformance cannot be ignored.

    **Recommendation:**  A cautious approach is warranted.  Before investing, further research is needed to understand the reasons behind the EPS volatility and the negative long-term return outlook. The contrasting positive analyst ratings suggest a potential for future growth, but this needs to be weighed against the risks highlighted by the performance metrics. Monitor ADSK's performance and earnings releases closely. Consider the Hybrid Signal and the fact that the MRI rating is at the lower end of the range, advising to do very light investment.
