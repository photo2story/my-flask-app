**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Autodesk has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period by 9.05%.  While the cumulative return is positive, it lags behind the market benchmark.  The alpha and beta analysis below reveals significant volatility and varying performance relative to the market (beta) across different periods. High beta values suggest increased market sensitivity. The high and fluctuating alpha suggests the stock’s performance isn’t always closely correlated to the market's overall movement.  Periods of strong outperformance are offset by significant underperformance.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While revenue has generally increased, EPS shows some fluctuation, indicating potential challenges in profitability or cost management. Further investigation into the underlying factors driving these variations is needed.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | $1.57B        |

**5) Financial Information:**

The financial information highlights consistently high profit margins.  However, there is a significant drop in equity and ROE in Q4 2023, which requires further examination to understand the underlying causes. The recent rebound in equity and ROE is a positive sign but needs confirmation through further data and analysis.

|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $1.64B   | 90.60%        |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

ADSK shows a mixed picture. While exhibiting periods of strong growth and outperformance of the S&P 500, it has also experienced significant periods of underperformance.  The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction.  The recent earnings and financial data reveal some inconsistencies that need further investigation. The high expected return is optimistic and depends on sustained future growth, which is not guaranteed given the historical volatility.  A deeper dive into the company's fundamentals, industry trends, and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high beta indicates sensitivity to market fluctuations, making it a potentially riskier investment compared to a lower-beta stock.
