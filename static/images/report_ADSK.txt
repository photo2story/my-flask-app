| 2023-2025  | -17.0% | 81.2%  | -81.0%  | 1.4    | 63.7   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Strong growth in earlier periods, but declining and negative in recent years.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD suggests significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Positive Alpha in earlier years indicated outperformance relative to the market. Negative Alpha in recent years shows significant underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Low Beta values in the earlier years suggest ADSK was less sensitive to market movements.  Increasing Beta in recent years means it's becoming more sensitive to market fluctuations, amplifying both gains and losses.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** The capitalization has fluctuated.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close**: 299.24
*   **Previous Close**: 292.97
*   **Change**: 2.14
*   **5-day SMA**: 296.286
*   **20-day SMA**: 298.9659
*   **60-day SMA**: 304.3225

**Analysis:** The stock price closed higher than the previous day. The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are below the 60-day SMA, which *could* indicate a potential short-term upward trend *if* the shorter-term SMAs begin to rise. However, the 5-day SMA is still the lowest, suggesting the recent upward movement is very recent and may not be sustained.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator)**: 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI**: 46.99 (Neutral)
*   **PPO**: -0.1696 (Negative)
*   **Hybrid Signal**: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change**: -0.8 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%)**: -1297.1% (Significant negative expected return)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A "Medium Investment" recommendation needs to be considered with caution given other indicators.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 46.99 is generally considered neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests allocating all available cash and investing monthly, which is rated Very Safe with a high MRI. However, the historical data indicates substantial risk.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** A negative change suggests downward momentum in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return is extremely concerning.  This is a red flag indicating a high likelihood of continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500 *if* these trends continue.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Autodesk (ADSK) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Signals:**  The most concerning aspect is the *significant underperformance* relative to the S&P 500 and the *extremely negative expected return*.  High maximum drawdowns and recent negative alpha figures further reinforce this caution. The stock's beta has increased, meaning it's now more susceptible to market volatility, which could amplify losses.
*   **Positive Signals:** Strong and increasing revenue, exceptionally high profit margins, and a "Buy" consensus from analysts are positive indicators.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Recent news items present conflicting viewpoints (valuation concerns vs. analyst buy ratings).
*   **Recommendation (Based Solely on Provided Data):** *Caution is advised.* While analysts have a "Buy" consensus, the significant underperformance, negative expected return, and high volatility suggest that ADSK may be a risky investment at this time. The Hybrid signal suggests buying (a small amount, very safely), but should be tempered by the historical data and recent divergence. Deeper due diligence is crucial. Analyze *why* the company is underperforming the S&P500, understand the reasons behind the negative Alpha, and assess whether the recent decline is a temporary correction or a sign of more fundamental problems. Pay close attention to upcoming earnings reports and analyst revisions. A significant change in these negative indicators would be needed to consider a buy recommendation.
