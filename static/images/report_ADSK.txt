*   **Analysis:**  Autodesk demonstrates extremely high profit margins. Equity has increased over the period, and ROE remains strong, although there was a dip in Q2 2025. This suggests solid financial health.

**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

Autodesk presents a mixed picture. Recent news and analyst ratings are generally positive, highlighting the company's focus on AI, efficiency, and strong Q1 revenue performance. The company exhibits strong profitability, as evidenced by high-profit margins and solid ROE. Recent earnings data suggests growth in revenue and EPS.

However, concerns arise from its underperformance relative to the S&P 500, as indicated by the negative divergence and alpha values in recent years. The extremely negative expected return is a significant red flag. The current price action suggests a short-term downtrend, and the mixed technical indicators paint a cautious picture.

**Recommendation:**

While analysts are bullish and the MRI suggests a favorable investment climate, the negative expected return and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrant caution. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the extremely negative expected return. A more conservative approach would be to wait for a more positive trend in relative performance and a less negative expected return before considering a significant investment.
