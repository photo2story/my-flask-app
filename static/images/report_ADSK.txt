## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) is a multinational software corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, and construction industries.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this discrepancy.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **ADSK Cumulative Return:** 66.61%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** -22.83% (ADSK underperformed VOO by 22.83%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 10.0% (This indicates that the current underperformance is in the 10th percentile of the historical range of divergence between ADSK and VOO.)

The substantial difference in cumulative returns highlights ADSK's underperformance relative to the broader market.  This requires deeper investigation into potential factors affecting ADSK's performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $264.61
* **Last Market Price:** $267.78 (1.2% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $265.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $261.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $283.93

The recent price shows a slight upward trend, though it remains below all three moving averages, suggesting potential resistance above the current level.  The price is closer to its 5-day and 20-day averages, suggesting short-term support. The relatively significant gap between the current price and the 60-day MA might suggest a recent pullback from higher highs.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 63.04 (Neither overbought nor oversold, slightly above neutral)
* **PPO:** 0.55 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 59.1% (Superior to the S&P 500 over the long term)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture.  While the RSI and PPO suggest some positive momentum, the negative relative divergence and the medium risk MRI warrant caution. The relatively small, recent price increase (1.2%)  doesn't suggest a dramatic upward or downward shift.  The high expected return, however, is encouraging for long-term investors.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-12-03 | $1.28  | $1.57B       |

| 2024-12-03 | $1.13  | $1.41B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Revenue shows a slight upward trend, while EPS fluctuates.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.  Further analysis is needed to assess the underlying trends in earnings and their sustainability.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

ADSK shows strong financial fundamentals with consistent revenue growth and high profit margins. However, its recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, indicated by the significant negative return difference. While technical indicators are mixed, the long-term expected return remains positive.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons for underperformance relative to the market.  Investors should carefully consider the risk-reward profile before making any investment decisions, particularly scrutinizing the inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entry) and conducting independent research to validate the provided figures and long-term growth projections.
