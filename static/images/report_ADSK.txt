**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜         | EPS   | 매출       |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-11-26 | 1.61  | 1.85 B$   |
| 2025-09-02 | 1.47  | 1.76 B$   |
| 2025-05-29 | 0.71  | 1.63 B$   |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28  | 1.57 B$   |
| 2025-11-26 | 1.28  | 1.57 B$   |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue and EPS have generally been increasing. However, there's some irregularity in this data as 2025-11-26 occurs twice with different values. Assuming the first entry with 1.61 EPS and 1.85 B$ revenue is correct, it shows positive momentum.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2025-01-31 | $2.62B   | 11.56%|
| 2024-10-31 | $2.62B   | 10.51%|

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue is steadily increasing.
*   Profit margins are extremely high and stable, indicating a strong business model.
*   Equity is growing.
*   ROE (Return on Equity) is good but shows variation, suggesting possible fluctuations in profitability relative to shareholder equity.  The dip in 2025-04-30 needs further investigation.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Autodesk presents a mixed picture.  On one hand, the company has strong revenue growth, exceptional profit margins, and positive analyst ratings.  On the other hand, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, has a very negative expected return, and is exhibiting increasing volatility (Beta). Recent news articles hint at potential challenges.

*   **Positives:**  Strong and growing revenue, exceptionally high profit margins, a healthy ROE, and a BUY recommendation from analysts.
*   **Negatives:**  Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, increasing stock volatility, negative relative divergence, and a very negative "Expected Return" suggesting investment now will not perform well in the long-term.

**Conclusion:**

While analysts generally rate the stock as a "Buy," the data suggests caution. The substantial underperformance, combined with increasing volatility and a negative expected return, indicate that Autodesk may be facing significant headwinds. Further investigation into the reasons behind the underperformance and the drivers of the negative expected return are essential before making an investment decision. The extremely high and consistent profit margins bear further scrutiny, to understand if they are sustainable.
