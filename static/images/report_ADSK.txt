*   **Beta:** Beta measures volatility relative to the market.  The increasing Beta values, reaching 1.4, suggest ADSK's price is becoming increasingly sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap:** Market Cap seems to have peaked around 2018-2020 and is now stabilizing.

*   **Current Close:** 299.54
*   **Last Market Change:** -0.56 (Price: 299.54, Previous Close: 301.23)
*   **5-day SMA:** 299.45
*   **20-day SMA:** 300.96
*   **60-day SMA:** 301.99

**Analysis:** The stock price shows a slight downward trend as the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. The recent market change (-0.56) is relatively small, suggesting moderate price fluctuation.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 46.42 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.08 (Neutral, suggesting slight bullish momentum)

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** -1.6 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1487.9 (Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500).

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, seemingly contradictory to the negative expected return.  This might indicate a potential undervaluation or expectation of future recovery. The RSI is neutral, while the PPO indicates slightly bullish momentum. However, the significantly negative expected return is a major concern. The recent decrease in relative divergence suggests short-term downward pressure.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE    |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| 2025-10-31   | $2.89B   | 11.86% |
| 2025-07-31   | $2.71B   | 11.53% |

| 2024-10-31   | $2.62B   | 10.51% |

**Analysis:** Revenue is generally increasing, and profit margins are extremely high, consistently above 90%. Equity is also increasing, and ROE (Return on Equity) is high, although it dipped significantly in one quarter (2025-04-30). The high profit margins suggest a strong competitive advantage.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Autodesk (ADSK) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Recent Performance:** ADSK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial divergence in returns. Recent CAGR, Alpha values are negative.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, while the drastically negative expected return paints a concerning picture.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus with a notable target price potential.
*   **Financial Strengths:** The company boasts robust revenue growth, extremely high profit margins, increasing equity, and healthy ROE (except for one outlier quarter).
*   **Recent News:** News articles present a combination of positive and negative sentiment, ranging from price target lifts to position cuts and comparisons to competitors.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The stock price shows a slight downward trend.
*   **Market Sensitivity:**  Beta is increasing, which means that the price of ADSK stocks is increasingly sensitive to market volatility.

**Conclusion:**

Despite strong financial fundamentals and analyst optimism, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative expected returns, and short-term downward pressure are major concerns. The high investment recommendation by the MRI seems contradictory to the overall negative signals, suggesting further investigation is warranted to understand the underlying reasons for this discrepancy. A potential turnaround story might be brewing, but significant risks remain. Investors should carefully weigh the positive financial aspects against the concerning performance data and conduct further due diligence.
