*   **Change:** -0.21

*   **Expected Return (%):** 2413.1

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk. The RSI of 37.33 suggests that the stock is approaching oversold conditions, although not definitively. The PPO is negative, indicating bearish momentum. The hybrid signal suggests a defensive position with a high cash ratio and a recommendation to sell a small portion of holdings. The 20-day relative spread change indicates a short-term increase in the spread between ADSK and VOO. The exceptionally high expected return figure (2413.1%) should be treated with extreme caution. Such a high number is likely the result of model error or unrealistic assumptions and shouldn't be used as a reliable predictor.

**Important note:** The small price change from previous close (-0.21) isn't significant enough to indicate a substantial event like a 급반등 or 급하락.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------- |

| 2024-04-30   | $2.16B    | 11.66%    |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been growing steadily. Profit margins are exceptionally high and stable, indicating strong pricing power and efficient cost management. Equity has generally increased, but ROE (Return on Equity) has decreased significantly in the latest quarter. This could be a cause for concern.

**7. Overall Analysis & Summary:**

Autodesk (ADSK) presents a mixed picture. While revenue and profit margins are strong, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The recent trend of low or negative CAGR, high MDD, and negative alpha in the 3 year returns raises concerns about short-term performance. The decreasing ROE in the most recent quarter is another point of concern. The recent news indicates potential volatility and significant developments that need to be monitored. The technical indicators suggest a cautious approach. While the stock is approaching oversold territory, the overall trend is bearish. The hybrid signal recommends a defensive position. The extremely high, and likely unrealistic, expected return should be disregarded.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Due Diligence:** Conduct thorough research to understand the reasons behind the recent underperformance and decreasing ROE.
*   **Monitor News:** Closely monitor company announcements, industry trends, and global economic factors.
*   **Cautious Approach:** Given the bearish signals and recent underperformance, a cautious approach is warranted. Consider the hybrid signal's recommendation for a defensive position.
