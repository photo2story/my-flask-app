*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 42.71
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.0184
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)

    *   **Analysis:**
        *   The MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" level, but this contrasts with the underperformance issues highlighted earlier. It's crucial to investigate *why* the MRI is so high despite the underperformance.
        *   The RSI of 42.71 is below 50, indicating that the stock is not overbought, and potentially nearing oversold.
        *   The PPO is close to zero, suggesting that short term and long term prices are nearing.
        *   The hybrid signal advises 100% investment with the high MRI, but with caution.
        *   The positive divergence change suggests short-term positive momentum.
        *   The *zero* expected return is concerning. This means that, based on the model, there's no anticipated outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.

Autodesk presents a complex picture. While it exhibits strengths in recent earnings, profitability, and analyst sentiment, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative alpha, high volatility, and concerning news headlines raise serious questions. The zero expected return is particularly troubling.

*   **Recommendation:**

A cautious approach is warranted. Before investing, it's crucial to:

    *   **Investigate the Reasons for Underperformance:** Understand why ADSK has lagged the S&P 500 and whether the issues are temporary or structural.
    *   **Assess the AI Strategy:** Evaluate the potential of the AI initiatives to drive future growth.
    *   **Reconcile the MRI Indicator with the broader picture:** Understand the assumptions underlying the Market Risk Indicator and whether it accurately reflects the risks and opportunities.
    *   **Monitor News and Analyst Ratings:** Stay informed about any changes in sentiment or new developments.
    *  **Careful consideration for High MDD and Beta metrics.**

If the issues driving underperformance are temporary and the AI strategy shows promise, ADSK *might* be a worthwhile investment, but only with a clear understanding of the risks involved.
