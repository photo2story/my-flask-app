**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, recent financial performance reveals some concerns, including decelerating revenue growth and a significant decline in ROE.

The high expected return is encouraging, but it's crucial to carefully consider the risks associated with this high projection and the recent downward trends in some financial metrics.  More information on recent news, analyst opinions, and earnings expectations is crucial for a complete and accurate assessment.
