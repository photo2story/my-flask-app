**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) is a multinational software corporation that makes software products and services for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, education, and entertainment industries.

The cumulative return for ADSK is 136.51%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 118.37%.  This represents a difference of 18.1 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 22.3% indicates that ADSK's performance is situated in the upper portion of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance over different time periods. While some periods exhibit significantly higher returns than the market (high Alpha), others show considerable underperformance (negative CAGR).  The consistent Beta of 63 indicates high market sensitivity – ADSK's price tends to move more dramatically than the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $291.45
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $288.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $293.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $298.55

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The 5-day moving average being below the 20-day and 60-day averages further supports this.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.87 – This indicates that the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce. However, it's important to consider this in conjunction with other indicators.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.97% - A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.4 –  Short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 92.9% – This high expected return, stated as exceeding S&P 500 performance over the long term (2+ years), needs further justification and should be treated with caution.  The basis for this projection is not provided and should be scrutinized.  A 92.9% return is exceptionally high and unlikely to be consistently achieved.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistencies.  While revenue has generally increased, EPS has fluctuated.  There are also duplicate entries for December 2024.  This requires further clarification to get a clear picture of the company's performance.  The data provided is insufficient for a robust earnings analysis without clarifying the duplicate entry.

|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28  | $1.57B       |

| 2024-12-03 | 1.13  | $1.41B       | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows high profit margins consistently above 90%. However, Equity and ROE show a decline in the latest quarter. This requires further investigation to determine if this is a short-term anomaly or a trend indicating a potential issue.

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity  | ROE     |
|-------------|------------|---------------|---------|---------|
| 2024-10-31  | $1.57B     | 90.64%        | $2.62B  | 10.51%  |

| 2023-07-31  | $1.34B     | 90.56%        | $1.21B  | 18.41%  |


**7. Summary:**

ADSK has shown periods of strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but also significant periods of underperformance, highlighting substantial risk.  The current price is below key moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. While RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and declining equity/ROE raise concerns.  The provided expected return of 92.9% lacks sufficient justification and should be viewed skeptically.  Inconsistencies in the provided earnings data need clarification.  A thorough fundamental analysis incorporating additional financial data and industry comparisons is required for a comprehensive assessment of ADSK's investment prospects.  The high Beta necessitates a careful consideration of risk tolerance.
