2025-12-20 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Autodesk (ADSK) based on the provided data, structured as requested:

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** Autodesk Inc. is a design and make software company for architecture, engineering, construction, media and entertainment industries.
*   **Return Comparison:**
    *   ADSK Cumulative Return: 25.30%
    *   VOO Cumulative Return: 100.88%
    *   Divergence: -77.1 (Relative Divergence: 1.1)
*   **Analysis:** Autodesk's return significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the total measured period. The divergence is substantial (-77.1), indicating a large gap in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 1.1 suggests the current divergence is near the minimum of its historical range. This underperformance needs further investigation.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|

| 2023-2025  | -17.0% | 81.2% | -82.0% | 1.4 | 63.9 |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has fluctuated significantly, with substantial positive returns in earlier periods (2015-2021) followed by negative returns in more recent periods (2020-2025).
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential risk. MDD is particularly high around 80% in recent years, suggesting substantial price declines from peak to trough.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha, which measures performance relative to a benchmark, is positive in the earlier periods, showing outperformance. However, it turns significantly negative in recent periods, indicating substantial underperformance relative to the benchmark.
    *   **Beta:** Beta has been steadily increasing, rising to 1.4 in the most recent period. A beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility compared to the market.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization shows it is a large cap stock.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   Close: 300.08
*   Previous Close: 299.24
*   Change: 0.28
*   5-day SMA: 296.116
*   20-day SMA: 299.4104
*   60-day SMA: 303.9318
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The stock price closed slightly higher than the previous close.
    *   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are below the 60-day SMA. This *could* indicate a short-term downtrend, but the SMAs are very close in value. Need more data.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis:**

*   MRI: 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 45.27
*   PPO: -0.0827
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent Divergence Change (20 days): -0.8 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   Expected Return (%): -1297.1

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.7 suggests a *Medium Investment* recommendation, but the hybrid signal references 0.9 which indicates a very safe investment.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 45.27 is neutral. An RSI below 30 is often considered oversold, and above 70 is overbought.
    *   **PPO:** A PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of -0.0827 suggests that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, corroborating the SMA downtrend signal.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The recommendation is to buy with 100% cash, but it also mentions "Very Safe" with an MRI of 0.90, which contradicts the actual MRI of 0.7. This conflicting signal requires clarification.
    *   **Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence (-0.8) aligns with the short-term downtrend observed in the moving averages.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-1297.1%) is a major red flag.  This suggests a very pessimistic outlook for future performance compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   Whalen Wealth Management Inc. Acquired Shares
    *   Looking Back At The Past 3 Years
    *   Exploring Valuation After Recent Share Price Weakness and Ongoing Double-Digit Growth
    *   Analysts’ Top Technology Picks: Rubrik, Inc. Class A (RBRK), Autodesk (ADSK)
    *   BTIG initiates Autodesk stock with Buy rating, sets $365 price target
    *   Stock Moves -1.46%: What You Should Know

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The news is mixed.  A wealth management firm acquiring shares and analysts listing ADSK as a top pick are positive signals. The BTIG "Buy" rating with a $365 price target is also positive (significant upside from the current price of ~$300).
    *   However, articles discussing "recent share price weakness" and a small drop in stock price highlight concerns. The "Looking Back" article *might* indicate a need to reassess performance in the context of recent difficulties.
    *   Overall, the news is cautiously optimistic, with analyst support counterbalanced by recent performance concerns.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   Consensus: Buy (Mean: 1.56)
*   Opinions: 30
*   Target Price: 366.13 (Avg) / 460.00 (High) / 275.00 (Low)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The analyst consensus is strongly positive ("Buy").
    *   The average target price ($366.13) represents a significant upside potential from the current price. However, the low target price ($275) suggests some analysts are less optimistic.
    *   Without information on the "Recent Rating Changes" (the " → ()" entries), it's impossible to know if opinions are shifting.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출  |
|------------|------|-------|
| 2025-11-26 | 1.61 | 1.85 B$ |
| 2025-09-02 | 1.47 | 1.76 B$ |
| 2025-05-29 | 0.71 | 1.63 B$ |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | 1.57 B$ |
| 2025-11-26 | 1.28 | 1.57 B$ |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Revenue and EPS have generally increased over the periods shown.
    *   The high EPS of 1.61 with revenue of 1.85B$ in 2025-11-26 looks great. However, there are duplicated values in the table (2024-12-03 and 2025-11-26) with the same EPS and revenue which seems suspicious.
