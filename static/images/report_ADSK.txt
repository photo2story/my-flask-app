The cumulative return of ADSK is 147.68%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.91%.  The difference is 26.8%, placing it at the 26.5th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided data).  This indicates a generally positive outperformance, though not consistently extreme.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $303.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $306.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $305.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $291.99

The stock price is currently below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential longer-term support level.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.33 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.25 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** -0.9 – Indicates a recent downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 57.2% – This represents a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, assuming the current trend continues.  However, this should be considered with caution given the historical volatility.
* **Price Consideration:**  The current price of $303.77, given the RSI and PPO values, doesn't strongly suggest an immediate sharp upward or downward movement.  It's more likely to remain within its current trading range for the short term.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies.  There is a duplicate entry for 2024-12-03.  Ignoring the duplication:

* **Latest Quarterly Results:** Revenue and EPS show some minor fluctuations quarter-over-quarter.  There is not a clear upward or downward trend.
* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue has shown a generally upward trend in the periods reported, though growth is not consistent.
* **EPS Trends:**  EPS fluctuates between approximately $1.13 and $1.31 over the reported quarters.  No significant consistent trend is evident.
* **Beats or Misses:** The provided data doesn't include any information about earnings expectations to assess beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has steadily increased quarter-over-quarter. Profit margins are high and relatively stable, hovering around 90%.  A slight dip occurred in Q4 2024, but this isn't drastic.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has increased, indicating growth. ROE shows significant volatility, peaking at 18.41% in Q2 2023 then declining in subsequent periods.  This warrants further investigation to understand the underlying factors driving this variance.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent issues were provided in the initial prompt.  This section requires additional information.  Further research into recent news headlines and financial news outlets is recommended.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has demonstrated strong long-term growth significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, recent performance has shown some short-term weakness, with the stock trading below its short-term moving averages.  Technical indicators suggest potential for a rebound, but also highlight bearish momentum.  The financial data reveals a healthy company with strong revenue growth and high profit margins, though with some volatility in profitability metrics.  More detailed analysis is needed, particularly concerning the fluctuating ROE and the absence of news related to recent performance.  The absence of information about earnings expectations prevents a comprehensive assessment of recent earnings reports.  A deeper dive into financial news and analyst opinions is required for a complete picture.


**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the information provided, a long-term investment approach with a focus on risk mitigation is suggested.  Further research is strongly recommended to:

* **Assess the volatility of ROE:** Investigate the reasons behind the fluctuations in Return on Equity.
* **Analyze earnings expectations:** Compare reported EPS figures against analyst expectations to determine if the results were beats or misses.
* **Review recent news and analyst opinions:** Stay informed about any recent news, market outlooks, and analyst opinions affecting ADSK's stock performance.

Only after conducting this additional research can a more informed investment decision be made.  This analysis should not be considered financial advice.
