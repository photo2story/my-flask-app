The table below shows the CAGR, Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and Market Capitalization for various periods.  Noteworthy is the high alpha in recent years, suggesting outperformance relative to the market, but also significant volatility and negative returns in some periods.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 66.0% | 17.6% | 38.0% | 0.1 | 22.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $282.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $284.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $298.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $298.33

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend. The recent price change (-$1.16) reflects a small negative shift.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.63 (Suggests the stock is oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.78 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.0 (Short-term upward trend, but needs confirmation)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 92.6% (Significantly higher than the S&P 500's expected return,  but this is a projection and subject to significant uncertainty)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO signal potential for a rebound.  However, the price is below its moving averages, indicating bearish sentiment in the short term.  The significant expected return needs to be viewed with caution; long-term projections are inherently uncertain.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-12-03 | 1.28 | $1.57 B     |
| 2024-09-03 | 1.31 | $1.50 B     |
| 2024-06-10 | 1.17 | $1.42 B     |
| 2023-12-04 | 1.13 | $1.41 B     |
| 2024-12-03 | 1.13 | $1.41 B     |


There seems to be an error in the data with two entries for 2024-12-03.  Assuming the second entry is a duplicate, the data shows relatively stable revenue with some fluctuation in EPS.  Further analysis would require a longer time series and consideration of other financial metrics.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $1.57B | 90.64% |
| 2024-07-31 | $1.50B | 90.70% |
| 2023-10-31 | $1.41B | 91.02% |
| 2023-07-31 | $1.34B | 90.56% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-10-31 | $2.62B | 10.51% |

| 2023-10-31 | $1.48B | 16.26% |
| 2023-07-31 | $1.21B | 18.41% |

Revenue shows steady growth. Profit margins are consistently high, but ROE has decreased recently, possibly indicating a less efficient use of capital.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showcasing high CAGR and significant alpha in certain periods. However, recent performance shows volatility and a downward trend, reflected in the price being below its moving averages and the negative PPO. While the oversold RSI suggests potential for a rebound,  the declining ROE and the need to address the duplicated data raise concerns. The high projected long-term return should be viewed cautiously.  A more thorough analysis, incorporating a deeper dive into financial statements and industry trends, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with high-growth technology stocks and the potential for further volatility.
