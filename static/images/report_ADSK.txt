*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows strong performance in earlier periods (2015-2021) but has turned negative in recent years (2020-2025).
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown indicates the maximum loss from peak to trough during the period. MDD is high across all periods, suggesting significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the outperformance of the investment relative to the benchmark (S&P 500, presumably).  Early periods had positive alpha, but recent periods show significant negative alpha, meaning ADSK underperformed the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. Beta has been increasing, particularly in recent years, indicating ADSK has become more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in billions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 300.71
*   **Previous Close:** 298.21
*   **Change:** 0.84
*   **5-day SMA:** 299.41
*   **20-day SMA:** 301.16
*   **60-day SMA:** 302.59

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the previous close, indicating a small upward movement. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting that the short-term trend is slightly downward compared to the longer-term trends. However, the differences between the SMAs are relatively small, so the trend is not dramatically changing.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.18
*   **PPO:** 0.04
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.8 (+) (단기상승 - Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -797.7%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI is extremely high, suggesting a strong buy recommendation. However, this might be an anomaly or based on a specific model, and it should be considered cautiously in light of the other indicators.
    *   The RSI of 40.18 indicates that the stock is not overbought or oversold. Generally, RSI values below 30 suggest an oversold condition, while values above 70 suggest an overbought condition.
    *   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.04 is close to zero, which means that the short-term moving average is close to the long-term moving average.
    *   The Hybrid Signal suggests a strong buy signal, advising to use all available cash to purchase shares and to invest a small monthly amount.
    *   The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend.
    *   The very negative Expected Return is a serious concern. It indicates a high potential for losses if investing long-term. This conflicts with other signals and requires further investigation.

*   **Opinions:** 30
*   **Target Price:** 366.13 (High: 460.00, Low: 275.00)

However, the wide range between the high and low target prices (460 vs 275) indicates some disagreement among analysts.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Revenue has been steadily increasing over the past year.
    *   Profit margins are extremely high, consistently above 90%, indicating strong pricing power and efficient operations.
    *   Equity has also been increasing, suggesting the company is growing its asset base.
    *   ROE (Return on Equity) is generally strong, but it dipped significantly in the quarter ending April 30, 2025. However, it has since rebounded.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Performance Divergence:** ADSK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Volatility:** ADSK exhibits high volatility, as indicated by the high MDD values and increasing Beta.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Mixed signals. RSI is neutral, but the MRI is extremely high (potentially an anomaly). Recent divergence change suggests a short-term upward trend.
*   **News Sentiment:** Mixed, with positive institutional buying offset by recent price declines.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** Analysts are generally bullish, with a "Buy" consensus and a significantly higher target price, but a wide range in target prices reveals uncertainty.
*   **Earnings:** Earnings have been improving, and revenue has been on an upward trajectory.
*   **Financial Health:** Strong revenue, exceptionally high profit margins, increasing equity, and a generally healthy ROE (except for one recent dip) suggest a financially sound company.
*   **Crucial Concern:** The extremely negative Expected Return (-797.7%) is a major red flag and contradicts other positive signals. This requires further investigation to understand the model behind this projection and its validity.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The analysis presents a mixed picture of Autodesk. While the company exhibits strong financial health and analysts are generally optimistic, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, high volatility, and especially the extremely negative expected return are serious concerns that need to be carefully considered before making any investment decisions.
