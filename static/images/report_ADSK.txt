2024-12-20 - Analysis Report
## Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) Stock Report

This report analyzes Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) based on the provided data.  Note that several crucial pieces of information are missing (analyst opinions, recent market outlook, specific earning expectations to assess beats/misses) which limits the comprehensiveness of this analysis.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that develops and sells computer-aided design (CAD) software.

The cumulative return of ADSK is 139.41%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 114.28%. The difference is 25.1 percentage points.  The provided relative divergence of 25.6% indicates ADSK's performance is in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 over the period considered.  However, this relative comparison doesn't capture the full volatility picture.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values over time. While alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting some degree of outperformance, beta fluctuates significantly, indicating changing sensitivity to market movements. The high beta values (23-66) suggest that ADSK's price is historically more volatile than the overall market.  The negative CAGR values in recent years are concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $293.63
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $299.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $304.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $294.00

The stock is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it is slightly above its 60-day moving average, indicating some support.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.88 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.65 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.0% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 59% (Significantly higher than the market, reflecting the potential for outperformance. However, this projection lacks context and supporting data.)

The current price of $293.63 is below recent moving averages, aligning with the negative PPO and the declining relative divergence.  There's no indication of a rapid price jump or drop based solely on this information.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data reveals some inconsistencies. The table shows duplicate entries for December 2024.  Despite this, focusing only on the unique data points:

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows a general upward trend, though the growth rate appears to have slowed in recent quarters.
* **EPS:** EPS has also seen some fluctuation, with a slight decline in the most recent quarter compared to the previous one.  Without knowing expectations, it's impossible to determine if these numbers represent beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is consistently increasing, while profit margin is largely stable around 90%, indicating strong profitability.  However, the high profit margin might be unsustainable long-term.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity and ROE have been volatile. The significant drop in ROE from 2023-10-31 to 2024-10-31 is a major concern. This drastic decrease merits further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:** No information is provided on recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions.  This significantly limits the analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong cumulative return. However, recent trends suggest a weakening performance. The stock price is currently below its short-term moving averages, and the PPO and relative divergence indicators point towards bearish momentum. While revenue growth remains positive, EPS shows some volatility, and the significant decline in ROE is alarming. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a thorough assessment of current market sentiment and future prospects.  The projected 2+ year expected return of 59% is not sufficiently substantiated.  More information is needed before a comprehensive conclusion can be drawn.


**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the missing data and conflicting signals, a definitive buy/sell recommendation cannot be made.  Further investigation into the reasons for the decline in ROE, the details of the most recent earnings report (compared to expectations), and the current market sentiment is crucial before forming a sound investment decision.  The high beta suggests caution for risk-averse investors.
