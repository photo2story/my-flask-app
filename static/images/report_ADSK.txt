**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Autodesk Inc. is a multinational software corporation that makes software for architecture, engineering, and construction industries.

ADSK's cumulative return of 61.44% lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 76.08% by 14.6 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 12.1% suggests that while underperforming VOO,  this underperformance is not exceptionally extreme compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha and beta data show inconsistent performance against the market (VOO). While periods of high CAGR exist (e.g., 2018-2020), recent years (2021-2025) show significant negative returns, even exceeding the market's drawdowns. The increasing Beta also indicates higher volatility and sensitivity to market movements in recent periods.  The high beta values in recent years imply that the stock is more sensitive to market fluctuations, potentially explaining the underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $260.16
* **5-day Moving Average:** $260.32
* **20-day Moving Average:** $261.23
* **60-day Moving Average:** $277.57

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent closing price of $260.16 shows a slight decline of $1.95 from the previous close, indicating a downward trend in the recent trading session.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.55 (Below 50, indicating bearish sentiment)
* **PPO:** 0.53 (Positive, suggesting a potential bullish momentum)
* **Delta Relative Divergence:** 0.5 (positive, short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 145.6% (Over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is expected).  This high expected return should be viewed with caution, as it relies on various assumptions about future growth that might not materialize. The discrepancy between short-term bearish signals and the long-term expected return indicates uncertainty.

The negative price change (-$1.95) is relatively small and doesn't signal a dramatic drop.  However, the combination of the RSI below 50 and the price being below its moving averages warrants closer monitoring.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |

| 2023-10-31  | $1.41B  | 91.02%        |

Revenue is growing steadily, and profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong profitability.  A slight dip in profit margin from Q4 2023 to Q1 2025 is observable but not alarming.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity  | ROE     |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| 2025-01-31  | $2.62B  | 11.56%  |
| 2024-10-31  | $2.62B  | 10.51%  |
| 2024-07-31  | $2.47B  | 11.40%  |
| 2023-10-31  | $1.48B  | 16.26%  |

Equity shows a notable increase from 2023 to 2024, while ROE fluctuates but remains generally strong.  The significant increase in equity and the drop in ROE from 16.26% to around 11% between Q4 2023 and Q1 2025 needs further investigation to understand the underlying factors.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, showing a bearish short-term trend. However, the company demonstrates strong revenue growth and consistently high profit margins. The high long-term expected return is promising, but requires careful consideration given the short-term bearish signals.  The fluctuating ROE and significant increase in equity also require further investigation to fully understand the financial health of the company.  The data suggests a need for monitoring ADSK closely, looking for further signs to confirm if the short-term bearish trend is temporary or indicative of a more significant shift.  Additional due diligence, including an analysis of industry trends and the company's competitive landscape, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Clarification on the duplicated earnings data point is also necessary.
