*   **Negative Alpha and High MDD:** Alpha values are negative and the Maximum Drawdown is high in the Alpha/Beta analysis
*   **Recent Stock Price Trend:** Negative change in the relative deviation and change in last close price suggesting a short-term downward trend.
*   **Insider Selling:**  Large insider selling activity can be a negative signal, indicating a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects from those with the most knowledge.

**Conclusion:**  While Autodesk exhibits strong financial metrics and positive analyst sentiment, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative long-term expected return, and insider selling warrant careful consideration before making an investment decision. Further investigation into the reasons behind the underperformance and the insider selling would be prudent.
