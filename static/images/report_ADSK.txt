**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show a varying relationship between ADSK and the market.  Early periods (2015-2019) show positive alpha (outperformance), while later periods (2020-2025) show significant negative alpha, indicating underperformance against the market. The beta fluctuates considerably, implying significant sensitivity to market movements, which has increased significantly over the past few years.  The large swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicate significant volatility.

* **Closing Price:** $261.14
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $260.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $259.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $275.43

The price is currently slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but below the 60-day moving average.  This suggests some short-term upward momentum, but a potential resistance level around the 60-day average.  The recent price change of $2.70 (from previous close) indicates a relatively small positive movement, not signaling a significant 	'급반등' (sharp rebound).

* **RSI:** 48.07 - Approaching the neutral zone; neither overbought nor oversold.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-12-03 | $1.28 | $1.57 B     |

Earnings show some fluctuation, but generally positive revenue growth.  There's a potential data entry error as the December 2024 data is duplicated.  Further investigation is needed for accurate trend analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADSK's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, showing negative alpha and increased beta. While the company demonstrates strong revenue growth and high profit margins,  its recent performance needs more scrutiny. The significant volatility seen in historical data, coupled with recent underperformance warrants careful consideration. The high expected long-term return (139.5%) compared to the S&P 500 is a positive sign, but the data provided needs further validation and a deeper analysis to fully assess the validity of this prediction and to understand the drivers behind the significant fluctuations in performance.  Additional factors, such as industry trends and competitive landscape, should be considered for a complete investment decision.  The inconsistencies within the provided data (duplicate earnings entry, high ROE in Q4 2023) necessitate additional review of the source data.
