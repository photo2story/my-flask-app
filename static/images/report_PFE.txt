**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock closed at $27.99, slightly lower than the 5-day moving average of $28.13. This suggests a potential short-term bearish sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 23.08 indicates the stock is currently oversold, suggesting potential for a bounce back. The negative PPO value of -0.4 supports the oversold condition, suggesting further downside potential. 

The positive delta of 0.14 in the 20-day relative divergence indicates a potential short-term upward trend. However, the expected return is 0%, implying that long-term (2 years or more) investment in PFE may not generate significant returns compared to the S&P 500.

The most recent earnings report for the quarter ending 2024-10-29 saw PFE exceed expectations, reporting EPS of $1.06 compared to an expected EPS of $0.614. However, looking at the trend, it is evident that PFE has been consistently underperforming its earnings estimates for the past few quarters.

| Date | EPS | Expected EPS |

| 2024-01-30 | 0.1 | -0.19 |
| 2023-10-31 | -0.17 | -0.32 |

While the recent quarter beat expectations, the overall trend of underperforming estimates raises concerns about the company's future profitability. 

**5. Financial Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---|---|---|
