This places PFE at the lower bound of the historical relative performance range against the S&P 500.

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend. The relatively small gap between the closing price and the last market price suggests minimal recent volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (19.05):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.94):**  Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change (0.0):** Shows no significant change in relative strength over the past 20 days, indicating sustained underperformance.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The expected return of 0.0% suggests no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is anticipated.  This is largely due to the recent underperformance.  A long-term strategy would depend on future performance and overcoming the underperformance.
* **Last Market Price ($24.88):** No significant price jump or drop is evident in the last market price compared to the closing price.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS data shows mixed results.  While some quarters exceeded expectations, others significantly missed expectations, especially in the latter half of 2023. The most recent quarter (2024-10-29) showed EPS of $1.06 against an expectation of $0.614, which signals a positive surprise. However, it's critical to analyze the long-term trend and future projections to assess the overall financial health and outlook.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue has remained relatively stable, though profit margins have fluctuated, declining significantly in the second half of 2023 before showing improvement again. This likely reflects changes in the market for Pfizer's products.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE is highly variable. Negative ROE in the second half of 2023 is a considerable concern, indicating a period of poor return on shareholder equity. Improvement is evident in 2024 Q1 and Q2, but still low overall.

The financial data highlights variability and concerns about profitability, potentially contributing to the stock's underperformance.

Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions are crucial before making any investment decisions. A long-term investment strategy would require a significant turnaround in PFE's performance to offset the existing underperformance against the S&P 500.
