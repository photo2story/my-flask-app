The negative alpha, declining ROE, and mixed earnings reports indicate a need for careful evaluation before investment. Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial to a comprehensive assessment.  The expected return is currently projected to be very low relative to the market benchmark.  A long-term buy-and-hold strategy may be advisable, but the risks and the current market sentiment would suggest proceeding with caution.
