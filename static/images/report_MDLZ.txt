**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-07-30 | 0.45 | 8.34 B$ |

This weak performance can be attributed to factors such as rising inflation and raw material costs.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

MDLZ's performance has lagged behind the broader market, with its returns significantly lower than the S&P 500. Despite recent price gains, technical indicators suggest potential overbought conditions and negative momentum. While the expected return remains high, the latest earnings report indicates a disappointing performance and may negatively impact future growth potential. 

**6. Conclusion:**

Although MDLZ boasts a strong brand portfolio and a solid track record, its current performance leaves much to be desired. Investors should closely monitor its upcoming earnings reports and macroeconomic factors that could influence its future performance.  The recent earnings miss and the overbought technical indicators suggest caution may be warranted in the near term.
