MDLZ has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by a significant margin, with a cumulative return difference of -40.87%.  However, its relative divergence of 18.85% indicates that the stock's current underperformance is within the range of its historical performance, falling near the lower end of its past performance variability.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** 67.91

The current price is slightly above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential upside momentum. However, the relatively small gap between the price and moving averages suggests a lack of strong buying pressure.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20 days):** -9.95 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (5 years):** 19.28%

The RSI suggests the stock is in overbought territory, while the PPO indicates a slight downtrend.  The negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence suggests short-term downward pressure on the stock. However, the Expected Return of 19.28% presents a potential long-term opportunity for investors.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Revenue | 
|---|---|---|
| 2024-07-30 | 0.45 | 8.34 B$ |

The most recent earnings report (2024-07-30) showed a decline in EPS and revenue compared to the previous quarter. While the decline in revenue can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic conditions, the EPS miss was below analyst expectations. 

**5. Overall Analysis:**

MDLZ has experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While recent price action shows potential for a short-term rebound, the overbought RSI and negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence signal a potential for short-term correction. However, the long-term expected return of 19.28% and the company's strong brand portfolio and global market position offer potential for long-term value creation. 

**Conclusion:**

MDLZ currently presents a mixed picture for investors. While the company faces near-term headwinds, its long-term prospects remain positive. Investors should monitor the stock closely for signs of a potential short-term correction and consider the potential for long-term gains, considering the company's fundamental strength.
