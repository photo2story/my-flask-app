Investors should consider the inherent risks associated with this sector and diversify their portfolios accordingly. The high relative strength combined with positive EPS surprises suggests a currently bullish market sentiment.  Further analysis is recommended to confirm this sentiment.  A detailed competitive landscape analysis alongside macroeconomic factor consideration will be crucial before making any investment decisions.
