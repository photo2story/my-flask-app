## Micron Technology Inc. (MU) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Micron Technology Inc. is a leading provider of memory and storage solutions.  The provided data shows that MU's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **MU Cumulative Return:** 162.79%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 112.47%
* **Return Difference:** 50.3%

This indicates MU has outperformed VOO substantially over the measured period.  The relative outperformance (34.7%) places it in the upper portion of its historical range compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided max and min values.  However, it is crucial to consider the timeframe of this comparison.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) data shows significant volatility in MU's performance over the years. While it has shown periods of substantial outperformance (e.g., 2019-2021), it has also experienced significant negative returns (e.g., 2020-2024). The relatively low Beta (around 0.1) suggests lower sensitivity to overall market movements compared to the broader market.  However, the high Alpha values in periods of outperformance showcase the stock's ability to generate returns beyond the market's general performance. Alpha values are not consistently positive.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $95.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $98.996
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $94.822
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $100.6473

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend but near its 20-day moving average, indicating some potential support.

* **RSI:** 61.698  (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.1976 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)

The indicators suggest a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook.  The fact that the price ($95.06) is near its 20-day moving average and not significantly higher or lower suggests no significant recent rapid price changes (no evidence of a sharp upward or downward surge).


* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 88.1% over the long term (2+ years). This suggests significant potential for outperformance if the long-term trend continues.  However, this projection must be viewed cautiously as it is just a prediction.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

While recent price action shows some weakness, the company's financial performance (revenue growth, improving margins and profitability), positive earnings surprises, and relatively strong technical indicators paint a positive picture, particularly in the long term (2+ years). However, the historical volatility should be considered before making any investment decisions.  The 88.1% expected return is a projection and not a guarantee.  Further due diligence and consideration of risk tolerance are necessary.
