2025-01-26 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Micron Technology Inc (MU) based on the provided data, presented in a report format.

**Micron Technology Inc (MU) Investment Report**

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Micron Technology Inc is a leading provider of memory and storage solutions.

The cumulative return for MU is 185.26%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference is 63.1%, placing it in the 39.3rd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of 234.5% to -47.7%). This suggests that while MU has substantially outperformed the market, its current outperformance is not at its historical peak relative to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR data shows significant variability in performance across different time periods, highlighting the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. While periods of high growth (e.g., 2019-2021) are observed, periods of substantial decline (e.g., 2020-2022) also exist.  Alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting marginal outperformance relative to the market's beta, which varies significantly across time periods reflecting shifts in market risk.

The price is currently below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downtrend. However, it's above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some support. The recent price decline of $1.57 (-1.5%) from the previous close signals a minor correction.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-1.5%):** Shows a recent period of relative underperformance compared to the broader market.
* **Expected Return (72.7%):**  A substantial expected return exceeding the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This projection needs further clarification on its assumptions and methodology.

**5. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a clear upward trend, while profit margin has also improved significantly after a loss in Q4 2023. The increasing revenue and improving profit margins suggest strong financial health.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has steadily increased, reflecting healthy growth.  ROE has fluctuated, but generally improved recently, mirroring the improved profitability.


**7. Overall Analysis**

MU has demonstrated strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, its performance is cyclical, and recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction. The positive earnings surprises and improving financial statements suggest strong underlying fundamentals.  The high expected return over the long term is encouraging, but caution is warranted given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the currently overbought RSI reading.  Further investigation into the methodology behind the 72.7% expected return is crucial before making an investment decision.  The current price is below several moving averages, indicating potential further downside in the short term.  Long-term investors with a high risk tolerance might find MU attractive, but careful monitoring of the market conditions and further fundamental analysis is recommended.
