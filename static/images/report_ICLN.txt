2025-12-25 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of ICLN based on the data provided:

**1. Return Comparison & Overview**

*   **ICLN Overview:** iShares Global Clean Energy ETF offers exposure to global equities in the clean energy sector.
*   **Performance Disparity:** ICLN's cumulative return (26.13%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (100.88%) over the period analyzed.
*   **Divergence Analysis:** The current divergence of -74.8 falls within a range of -84.7 to 141.5. The relative divergence of 4.4 indicates that the current divergence is near the bottom of its historical range (close to the minimum divergence).

**Alpha, Beta, CAGR & MDD Analysis:**

The provided table gives some insights into the performance of ICLN over rolling 3-year periods. Let's break down each column:

*   **Year:** This represents the *end* year of the 3-year rolling period.
*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The average annual growth rate over the three years. ICLN has experienced extreme volatility, ranging from +151% to -138%.  The most recent periods show significantly negative CAGR values.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  ICLN consistently shows very high MDD, often exceeding 70%, indicating high risk.
*   **Alpha:** A measure of the investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis. It indicates how much an investment has outperformed or underperformed its benchmark.  ICLN's Alpha is highly variable, with positive periods (indicating outperformance) but also large negative Alpha values in recent years, suggesting significant underperformance compared to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** A measure of an investment's volatility relative to the market (in this case, likely the S&P 500). A Beta of 1 indicates that the investment moves in line with the market. A Beta greater than 1 suggests the investment is more volatile than the market, and less than 1 is less volatile.  ICLN's Beta fluctuates, but generally suggest it moves approximately in line with or slightly less volatile than the market. The very low numbers could signify that they're not correlated.
*   **Cap(B):** This likely refers to Market Capitalization in Billions, but the data shows all zeros. This field should be reviewed for accurate data.

**Analysis:**

*   **High Volatility:**  ICLN has historically exhibited extreme volatility, with large swings in both positive and negative directions.
*   **High Risk:** This is reinforced by the high maximum drawdown figures, meaning investors should be prepared for potentially significant losses.
*   **Inconsistent Performance:**  ICLN's alpha is inconsistent, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance against its benchmark. Recent years have been particularly challenging.
*   **Beta Concerns:** The Beta figures need to be validated.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 16.44
*   **Last Market Data:** Showing a slight recent increase (price: 16.58, previousClose: 16.54, change: 0.24)
*   **Moving Averages:** The 5-day SMA (16.30) is below the 20-day SMA (16.58), which is below the 60-day SMA (16.64). This suggests a recent downtrend, as shorter-term averages have fallen below longer-term averages.

**3. Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment) - Indicates that, according to this specific metric, the investment carries a medium level of risk.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.43 - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. An RSI below 30 is typically considered oversold, while above 70 is overbought.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.33 - Suggests a slight downtrend. Negative values indicate that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  "Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)" - This signal recommends investing all available cash, driven by a "Very Safe" assessment and a high MRI score. This conflicts somewhat with the overall analysis.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Negative) - Confirms a short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** -387.9% - This is an extremely negative outlook, suggesting significant potential losses if investing long-term. This is an incredibly bearish signal.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive News (Rating Upgrade):** A June article highlights clean energy as a winner in 2025.
*   **Institutional Investment:** A November article notes a significant investment in a sector ETF by an investment advisor.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Not Provided. This information is crucial for a more complete analysis.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis & Summary**

ICLN presents a complex and somewhat contradictory picture:

*   **Negative Momentum:** The recent price action, moving averages, PPO, and divergence change all point towards a current downtrend. The extremely negative Expected Return is a major red flag.
*   **High Risk & Volatility:** The historical data shows ICLN to be a high-risk, high-volatility investment, confirmed by high MDD figures.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While the MRI suggests a Medium Investment, other indicators and the expected return suggest significant caution. The "Very Safe" Hybrid Signal directly contradicts the broader bearish sentiment. This signal should be scrutinized.
*   **Sector Dependence:** ICLN's performance is heavily reliant on the broader clean energy sector and policy tailwinds.
*   **Conflicting News:** The news is mostly positive, but historical information shows poor performance in the past few years.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, investing in ICLN currently appears risky. The negative momentum, high volatility, and extremely pessimistic expected return outweigh the potentially positive news articles and conflicting Hybrid Signal. It is absolutely crucial to investigate the discrepancy in the Hybrid Signal, obtain analyst consensus estimates, and conduct further due diligence before considering an investment. The ETF's high volatility and underperformance compared to the broader market make it a questionable choice for risk-averse investors. If considering an investment, careful monitoring and a clear understanding of the risks are essential.
