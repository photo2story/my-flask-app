2025-11-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of ICLN based on the provided data.

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **ICLN Overview:** iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) provides exposure to companies worldwide that produce energy from clean energy sources.
*   **ICLN Cumulative Return:** 22.55%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 94.64%
*   **Divergence:** -72.1 (Relative Divergence: 5.6)

    *   **Analysis:**  ICLN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. The divergence of -72.1 highlights this underperformance. The relative divergence of 5.6 suggests that ICLN's performance is currently near the bottom of its historical divergence range compared to VOO. This means it has rarely performed this poorly against the S&P 500 in the past.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha     | Beta     | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | -76.0%   | 78.0%    | -135.0%   | -0.2     | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate demonstrates highly volatile returns. After very high growth between 2018-2022, the recent numbers have turned very negative.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant risk and large potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally negative, especially in recent years, implying ICLN has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.  The positive Alpha during the 2018-2022 period coincided with periods of high CAGR, but recent performance suggests a significant reversal.
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to zero, indicating that it follows the overall market only slightly.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 16.07
*   **Previous Close:** 16.08
*   **Change:** -0.06
*   **5-day SMA:** 16.42
*   **20-day SMA:** 17.23
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.06

    *   **Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day and 20-day SMAs but near the 60-day SMA.  This suggests a recent downtrend. The fact that the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA reinforces this bearish signal.

**3. Index Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 28.87 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.46 (Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (57 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)"
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.5 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -232.1 (Negative - Expected underperformance vs. S&P 500 long-term)

    *   **Analysis:**
        *   The Market Risk Indicator suggests a medium investment recommendation.
        *   The RSI value indicates that ICLN is currently in oversold territory, which *could* suggest a potential for a rebound.
        *   The negative PPO supports the bearish sentiment.
        *   Despite the indicators suggesting a potential buy, it is in conflict with the Expected Return (%) being highly negative.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Rating Upgrade (Seeking Alpha, 2025-06-15):**  "Clean Energy A Clear Winner In 2025, More Gains Ahead."  *This is an older, positive article that is in conflict with recent downward trend.*
*   **Big Money Buys (The Motley Fool, 2025-11-05):** "Investment Advisor Goes All-In on Sector ETF With $17.6 Million Purchase." *Positive indicator that institutional investors are accumulating shares.*
*   **Tactical Trading (stocktradersdaily.com, 2025-11-03):** "Why (ICLN) Price Action Is Critical for Tactical Trading." *Neutral, suggesting ICLN requires close monitoring.*
*   **52-Week High (Yahoo Finance, 2025-08-19):** "Clean Energy ETFs Hit a 52-Week High: Here's Why." *This is a lagging indicator, as the current analysis shows it is now doing poorly.*
*   **Put and Call Options (Nasdaq, 2025-11-10):** "Interesting ICLN Put And Call Options For June 2027." *Neutral - indicates options activity and potential speculation.*
*   **First Solar Gains (TradingView, 2025-11-03):** "ETFs to Watch as First Solar Gains 14% Despite Missing Q3 Earnings." *Positive catalyst. Although ICLN also includes other holdings besides First Solar.*

    *   **Analysis:** The news is mixed. While there was a rating upgrade in the past, more recent news points to technical analysis of short term trends. The "Big Money Buys" article suggests some institutional confidence, but this could be a contrarian play. The "52-Week High" article is outdated and not reflective of the current trend.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

ICLN is currently facing significant headwinds. While the clean energy sector has long-term potential, ICLN is drastically underperforming the S&P 500. The technical indicators suggest a recent downtrend and oversold conditions. While the oversold RSI could suggest a short-term bounce, the negative Alpha and expected return indicate fundamental issues.

*The older news is positive but is not indicative of the direction of ICLN over the past couple of months.*

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, *a cautious approach is warranted*. The negative expected return and underperformance compared to the S&P 500 suggest that there may be better investment opportunities elsewhere. While oversold conditions *could* lead to a short-term rebound, the longer-term outlook appears bearish. While the investment advisor purchasing a large sum of the ETF could be a positive sign, it would be better to see if any positive change is made before investing in ICLN.
