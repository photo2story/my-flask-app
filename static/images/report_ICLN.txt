### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 15.755
*   **Last Market Data:** `{'price': 15.7301, 'previousClose': 16.14, 'change': -2.54}` (Indicates a recent significant drop)

*   **60-day Moving Average:** 14.4857

**Analysis:**  The price is currently below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. The recent drop in price (as indicated by `{'price': 15.7301, 'previousClose': 16.14, 'change': -2.54}`) suggests some short-term negative momentum.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Outlook

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 65.27 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.0901 (Positive, indicating short-term bullish momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (62 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.1 (Negative, indicating short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -213.3% (Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 is expected)

**Analysis:**  While the MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" level, this seems contradictory to other indicators. RSI is approaching overbought levels.  The Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance. The extremely negative expected return is a major cause for concern. The Hybrid Signal suggests aggressive buying, but this should be viewed with caution given the other negative indicators.
