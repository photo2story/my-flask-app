**Analysis of Divergence:** ICLN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The divergence of -80.67% is substantial. The relative divergence of 4.0 suggests that ICLN's current underperformance is near the lowest end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Varies significantly, ranging from -48% to 195%, indicating high volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, between 70.8% and 84.4%, suggesting significant risk.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha is highly variable. High alpha values in the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 periods suggests outperformance relative to its risk-adjusted expected return. The most recent periods show significant negative Alpha, indicating underperformance.

*   **RSI:** 43.46
*   **PPO:** 0.0024

*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI (0.9):**  While this indicator suggests a "High Investment Recommended" level, this should be viewed with caution given the other indicators and recent performance.
*   **RSI (43.46):**  This indicates that ICLN is neither overbought nor oversold. It's in a neutral zone.
*   **PPO (0.0024):** A PPO close to zero suggests very little momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends a full investment (100% of cash), labeling it "Very Safe" due to the high MRI. This contrasts with the underperformance and drawdown concerns, requiring careful consideration.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence over the last 20 days ("short-term increase") suggests a possible recent improvement relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return (0.0%):** The key point here is the 0.0% expected return. This implies that the analysis predicts no excess return compared to the S&P 500, even with a long-term investment.
