*   **Expected Return:** -257.1% (Long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI of 34.26 indicates that the stock is nearing oversold conditions, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, but this should be considered in the context of other factors.
