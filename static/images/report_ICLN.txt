*   **Return Divergence:** -74.8 (ICLN underperformed VOO significantly)
*   **Relative Divergence:** 4.4 (The current divergence is near the low end of its historical range)

**1) Analysis of Return and Divergence**

ICLN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the long term. The current divergence of -74.8 indicates a substantial lag in ICLN's performance compared to the broader market. The relative divergence of 4.4 suggests this underperformance is near the worst it has been historically, relative to the observed range of divergence.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    *   **CAGR Volatility:** ICLN's CAGR shows considerable volatility, swinging from -138% to 151% over the periods analyzed. This indicates a high degree of risk and sensitivity to market conditions.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The consistently high MDD values (around 70-80%) highlight the significant potential for losses.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha fluctuates wildly, indicating inconsistent outperformance relative to the market. Recent negative Alpha values suggest underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, indicating ICLN is less volatile than the market. However, the Beta values are not consistent and even negative in some cases.

*   **5-day SMA:** 16.33
*   **20-day SMA:** 16.562
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.6189

The price has increased from previous close. However, the current price is below the 5, 20, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), potentially indicating a recent downtrend or consolidation phase. The positive change from the previous close might signal a short-term rebound.

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -0.3 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -374.4% (Significantly negative)

The RSI suggests ICLN is currently oversold, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity. However, the negative PPO indicates a bearish trend. The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk. The recent short-term decline in divergence is a negative signal. Most concerning is the dramatically negative expected return, indicating significant risks associated with a long-term investment at the current time.

Without additional positive catalysts or a significant change in market conditions, caution is warranted. The analyst consensus data, if available, would provide more insight.
