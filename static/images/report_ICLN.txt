2026-01-10 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of ICLN based on the provided data, compared against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **ICLN Overview:** iShares Global Clean Energy is an ETF that tracks global equities in the clean energy sector.
*   **ICLN Cumulative Return:** 29.39%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 92.74%
*   **Divergence:** -63.35% (ICLN underperformed VOO by 63.35%)
*   **Relative Divergence:** 6.6 (ICLN's performance relative to VOO is near the bottom of its historical range).

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, and Performance Metrics:**

The table provides insights into ICLN's performance over rolling 3-year periods:

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Highly volatile, ranging from -144% to 149%. Performance appears cyclical.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Substantial drawdowns, indicating significant risk, particularly recently.
*   **Alpha:**  ICLN's alpha has varied significantly, often negative, meaning it has often underperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Beta around 1 suggests that ICLN's volatility is similar to the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization of the fund (in billions).

**Key Observations:**

*   **Recent Underperformance:**  The last few years show extremely negative CAGR and Alpha, coinciding with large maximum drawdowns. This is a major concern.
*   **High Volatility:**  The wide range of CAGR figures and significant MDD values demonstrate ICLN's high volatility and susceptibility to market downturns or sector-specific headwinds.
*   **Beta Consistency:**  The relatively stable Beta near 1 suggests ICLN's price movements generally mirror the overall market's direction but with potentially amplified swings (as seen in the volatile CAGR).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 17.12
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 17.32, Previous Close: 17.12, Change: 1.17 (Indicates a slight recent increase)
*   **5-day SMA:** 17.11
*   **20-day SMA:** 16.66
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.81

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, further reinforcing the short-term bullish trend. The 20-day SMA is just below the 60-day SMA suggesting a possible stabilization.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment) - Suggests moderate risk, aligning with the fund's observed volatility.
*   **RSI:** 75.93 (Overbought) - Indicates that ICLN may be overvalued in the short term and susceptible to a pullback.
*   **PPO:** 0.47 (Positive) - Indicates the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  Cash 0%_Buy 90% (Safe - MRI: 0.80) - This signal suggests a moderate buy recommendation, but with a focus on safety.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** +2.8 (Short-term increase) - Supports the short-term upward price movement.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -194.9% - A very concerning figure. This indicates a highly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 if held long-term from the current point.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data, an investment in ICLN carries a high degree of risk. The fund's historical underperformance, volatility, and extremely negative expected returns suggest caution.
