2025-12-22 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the ICLN ETF based on the data provided.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **ICLN Overview:** iShares Global Clean Energy ETF focuses on global companies that produce energy from clean sources.
*   **ICLN Cumulative Return:** 26.13%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -74.76 (Relative Divergence: 4.4)
*   **Analysis:** ICLN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The large negative divergence (-74.76) shows a substantial difference in cumulative return, meaning that if you invested the same amount in ICLN and VOO, ICLN would be significantly less valuable today. The relative divergence of 4.4 suggests that this underperformance is near the lowest end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500. This indicates a period of significant and sustained underperformance.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows the average annual growth rate over the specified period.  Notice the significant declines in recent years.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  The MDD is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500, though not explicitly stated). Negative alpha values indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark. In recent years, the alpha is strongly negative, indicating significantly worse performance than the benchmark.
*   **Beta:**  Measures the investment's volatility relative to the benchmark. Beta values close to 0 indicates that the ETF has not been strongly correlated with the S\&P500, although we see more correlation in the more recent three-year windows.
*   **Cap(B):** The data is zeroed out, and as such, no conclusions can be formed about it.
*   **Analysis:** The historical data shows high volatility (high MDD) and inconsistent performance.  While there were periods of strong growth (2018-2021), the recent periods (2021-2025) show substantial losses and significant underperformance compared to the benchmark (as indicated by the large negative alpha).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 16.44
*   **Previous Close:** 16.18
*   **Change:** 1.61%
*   **5-day SMA:** 16.298
*   **20-day SMA:** 16.58
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.6402
*   **Analysis:**  The current price is above the 5-day SMA, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which indicates a potential longer-term downward trend or consolidation.  The recent positive change of 1.61% shows a short-term rebound.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 43.43
*   **PPO:** -0.33
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.2 (Decreasing Short Term)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -387.9%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI of 0.7 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation based on market risk, while the Hybrid Signal suggests a higher rating of 0.90 based on 100% purchase signal.
    *   The RSI of 43.43 is near the neutral territory (30-70), not indicating either overbought or oversold conditions but tilting towards oversold.
    *   The PPO of -0.33 is slightly negative, suggesting that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downward trend.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence (-0.2) indicates a recent short-term decline in performance relative to the comparison stock.
    *   **Importantly, the Expected Return of -387.9% is extremely negative.** This suggests a very pessimistic outlook for long-term returns compared to the S&P 500. This should be viewed with caution and carefully evaluated.
    *   The price change suggests a recent sharp rebound, potentially providing a short-term opportunity.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   Liquidity Pulse for Institutional Tactics
    *   Clean Energy A Clear Winner In 2025 (Rating Upgrade)
    *   Clean Energy’s Second Wind
    *   Big Money Buys: Investment Advisor Goes All-In
    *   Analyst Blog Highlights ICLN, QCLN, ACES and PBW

*   **Analysis:** The news is mixed. While some articles suggest positive outlooks ("Clean Energy A Clear Winner," "Clean Energy's Second Wind"), others focus on institutional investment and sector analysis. The "Rating Upgrade" headline from Seeking Alpha should be investigated further to understand the reasoning behind the upgrade and its credibility. The "Big Money Buys" article indicates some institutional interest, but it's essential to understand the specific reasons for the investment and whether it reflects broader market sentiment.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*  There is no consensus/targets/recent changes in analyst opinions

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

ICLN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, especially in recent years.  The high volatility (MDD) and negative alpha indicate a risky investment with underperformance relative to a broader market benchmark. The recent price rebound and some positive news headlines provide a glimmer of hope, but the overall technical indicators (negative PPO, negative divergence change) and, critically, the *extremely negative* Expected Return suggest caution.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **High Risk:** ICLN is a high-risk investment due to its high volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations.
*   **Underperformance:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Uncertain Outlook:** While there are some positive news articles and a recent price rebound, the technical indicators and, most importantly, the negative expected return, paint a concerning picture.
*   **Further Due Diligence Required:**  Before investing in ICLN, investors should conduct thorough due diligence, including examining the specific holdings of the ETF, understanding the clean energy sector's dynamics, and critically evaluating the analyst opinions and news reports. The extremely negative expected return requires a very careful understanding of the assumptions and methodology behind it.
*   **Alternative Considerations:** Consider diversifying your portfolio with other investments that have demonstrated more consistent performance and lower volatility. If you are focused on green energy, research alternative ETFs or individual stocks within the sector.
