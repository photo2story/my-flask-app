| 2023-2025  | -71.0%   | 78.0% | -136.0%  | -0.2   | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Highly volatile, ranging from -138% to +151%.  Recent periods (2021-2025) show significant negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, around 70-80%, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:**  A measure of outperformance relative to a benchmark (adjusted for risk).  ICLN's alpha is predominantly negative in recent periods, meaning it has underperformed on a risk-adjusted basis.  The large positive alpha from 2018-2022 is an outlier.
*   **Beta:**  A measure of volatility relative to the market. Beta has varied, suggesting ICLN's price movements have, at times, been correlated to the overall market (Beta > 0), and other times negatively correlated to the overall market (Beta < 0).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 16.77
*   **Previous Close:** 16.55
*   **Change:** 1.33% (Indicates a recent positive move)
*   **5-day SMA:** 16.656
*   **20-day SMA:** 17.0993
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.2471
*   **Analysis:** The price is currently above the 5-day and 60-day SMA but below the 20-day SMA. This suggests a possible short-term upward trend but the longer term is less certain. The recent change of 1.33% confirms a short-term upward trend.

**3) Indicators Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended).  This seems contradictory given the negative performance. *This is a key area to investigate further. The MRI calculation may be flawed or based on different factors than overall return.*
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.66 (Approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a possible buying opportunity).
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.43 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum, but close to zero).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (57 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90).  This signal recommends investing a fixed amount each month (0.8% of $1000 = $8).
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.0 (Negative, indicating a short-term decline relative to the benchmark).
*   **Expected Return:** -257.1% (Extremely negative, indicating very poor projected long-term performance compared to the S&P 500).

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Clean Energy’s Second Wind:** (Nasdaq) - Potentially positive news suggesting a possible rebound in the sector.
*   **ICLN: An Overview...** (Seeking Alpha) - Provides a general overview, likely not a significant short-term driver.
*   **Clean Energy ETFs Hit a 52-Week High:** (Yahoo Finance - from August) - This is outdated and misleading given the recent performance. It is not relevant to the current situation.
*   **(ICLN) Movement as an Input in Quant Signal Sets:** (stocktradersdaily.com) - Suggests ICLN's price fluctuations are being used for quantitative analysis, perhaps by algorithmic traders.
*   **The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights ICLN...** (Zacks) - Could be positive if the analysis is bullish.
*   **Big Money Buys...Sector ETF With $17.6 Million Purchase:** (Globe and Mail) - Positive news, indicating institutional interest in the sector.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Data is missing.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

ICLN presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Performance:** The ETF has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The CAGR, Alpha, and Expected Return are all concerning.
*   **High Risk:** The Maximum Drawdown is substantial, indicating high volatility.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The MRI suggests a buying opportunity, which contradicts the ETF's actual negative performance and negative expected return. The recent news indicates a possible rebound and institutional interest, but the negative indicators outweigh these positives.
*   **Recent Downward Trend:** Short-term indicators show possible upward movement but are still below previous figures, suggesting volatility in a downtrend.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Avoid or Reduce Exposure:** Given the significant underperformance, high risk, and extremely negative expected return, it's difficult to recommend investing in ICLN at this time. Investors currently holding ICLN should consider reducing their positions, particularly given the ETF's negative trajectory.

**Crucial Follow-up Questions:**

*   **Why is the MRI so high despite the poor performance?** Understanding the factors driving the MRI is essential.
*   **What are the specific holdings of ICLN?**  Analyzing the underlying companies is important.
*   **What are the long-term growth prospects of the clean energy sector?** A broader industry analysis is needed.
*   **Why is there a 52-week high news that occurred months ago?** Need to ensure that all the data extracted is relevant, factual, and timely.

Without the missing data points (analyst consensus, MRI calculation details), this analysis is limited. However, based on the information available, ICLN appears to be a risky investment with a poor recent and projected track record.
