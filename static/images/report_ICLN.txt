**1. Return Rate Comparison & Analysis**

*   **ICLN Overview:** iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, which aims to track the performance of global equities in the clean energy sector.
*   **Cumulative Return:** ICLN significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). ICLN's return was 26.13% compared to VOO's 100.88%.
*   **Divergence:** The current divergence is -74.8, indicating a substantial difference in performance.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows periods of high growth (2018-2021) followed by sharp declines (2021-2025).  The recent negative CAGR figures are concerning.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.  Even in positive CAGR periods, the MDD was substantial.
*   **Alpha:** Measures risk-adjusted performance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500, though not explicitly stated).  The Alpha values are largely negative, particularly in recent years, implying ICLN has been underperforming on a risk-adjusted basis. The large positive alpha during 2018-2020 may be due to specific events that favored clean energy stocks.
*   **Beta:**  Measures the volatility of ICLN relative to the market. The Beta values fluctuate but are relatively low, implying ICLN may be less volatile than the overall market, but given its negative alpha, that lower volatility hasn't translated to better risk-adjusted returns recently.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **SMA:** The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term downtrend.
*   **Last Market Price:** The price increase between the close and last market price may signal a positive move.

**3. Analysis of Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):**  0.8 suggests "Medium Investment Recommended." This conflicts somewhat with the negative performance data, potentially indicating a belief in future recovery or a sector-specific recommendation rather than an overall market assessment.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.43 is close to oversold (typically below 30), but not there yet. It suggests the stock may be approaching a potential buying opportunity, but further confirmation is needed.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.3327 indicates a slightly negative trend, as the short-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)" suggests a strong buy signal. However, you have to take the result with care since the result is model output and is intended to only be a reference.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** "-0.2 (-): 단기하락" confirms a short-term downward trend relative to its comparison benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The very negative Expected Return of -387.9% is alarming and suggests that the model used to generate this figure predicts significant underperformance in the long term compared to S&P 500, given the current conditions.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines present a mixed picture:

*   **Positive Headlines:** "Clean Energy A Clear Winner In 2025," "Clean Energy ETFs Hit a 52-Week High," "Clean Energy’s Second Wind," Analyst Upgrade
*   **Neutral/Informative Headlines:** "ICLN as a Liquidity Pulse," "Big Money Buys," "Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights ICLN, QCLN, ACES and PBW"

While some articles suggest positive prospects, the overall performance data suggests these headlines may be overly optimistic or reflect short-term trends rather than long-term sustainable growth.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

ICLN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. The CAGR, MDD, and Alpha data reinforce the impression of high volatility and recent poor performance. Despite the medium MRI, the strongly negative expected return raises serious concerns about long-term investment prospects, compared to investing in S&P 500.

The recent news is a mixed bag, with some positive headlines potentially creating a misleading impression. The technical indicators present a mixed picture, the 5-day SMA is trending below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, while the RSI indicates the stock might be approaching an oversold region, and the Hybrid Signal indicates a strong buy recommendation. The negative change in short-term divergence confirms a recent downward trend.

**In conclusion:** While there might be short-term trading opportunities or a belief in the long-term potential of clean energy, the current data suggests caution is warranted when considering a long-term investment in ICLN, especially given its consistent underperformance compared to a broad market index like the S&P 500.
