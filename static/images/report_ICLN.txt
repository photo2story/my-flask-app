**Report: ICLN (iShares Global Clean Energy) Analysis**

**1. Performance Overview**

*   **Ticker:** ICLN
*   **Company Description:** iShares Global Clean Energy ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of global equities in the clean energy sector.

**Key Numbers:**

*   **ICLN Cumulative Return:** 26.31%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 97.05%
*   **Relative Divergence:**
    *   Current: -70.7
    *   Max: 141.5
    *   Min: -84.7
    *   Relative Position: 6.2 (Indicates ICLN's performance is near the lower end of its historical divergence range compared to VOO)

**Analysis of Provided Table:**

The table presents a concerning picture of ICLN's performance relative to a benchmark (presumably S&P 500) over rolling 3-year periods. Key observations:

*   **Underperformance:**  ICLN consistently underperforms, with negative Alpha values in most periods.  Alpha measures the excess return relative to a benchmark; negative values indicate underperformance.
*   **High Volatility:**  High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures indicate substantial peak-to-trough declines, highlighting the ETF's high volatility.
*   **Inconsistent Beta:** Beta values vary and are often near zero, indicating a weak correlation with the overall market, and can be unstable.
*   **Recent Struggles:** The most recent periods (2021-2025) show significantly negative CAGR and Alpha, suggesting recent headwinds for the clean energy sector.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 16.53
*   **Previous Close:** 16.79
*   **Change:** -1.55% (a notable daily decline)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 16.60
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 15.85
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 14.76

**Analysis:**

*   The recent price decline (-1.55%) is significant, warranting attention.
*   The price is currently below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages.  This suggests a short-term pullback within a potentially longer-term upward trend (though this needs to be viewed cautiously in light of the broader performance issues noted above).

**3. Technical Indicators & Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5 (Low Investment - approaching Very Risky)
*   **RSI:** 72.60 (Approaching Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.29
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 1.1 (Positive - short-term improvement)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (62 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Expected Return:** -130.7% (Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI (0.5):** While not in the "Very Risky" zone, it's edging closer, indicating caution.
*   **RSI (72.6):**  Approaching overbought territory suggests the recent upward movement may be unsustainable in the short term.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (1.1):** The positive change indicates a recent improvement in ICLN's performance relative to its benchmark. However, the starting point of significant underperformance cannot be ignored.
*   **Expected Return (-130.7%):** This is a very concerning figure.  It suggests that, based on current models, ICLN is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.

**4. Recent News & Events**

*   **Key Themes:** The news headlines suggest a mixed outlook for clean energy ETFs:
    *   **Rare Earth Supply Concerns:** Potential disruptions could negatively impact the sector.
    *   **Trump Administration Impact:**  Policy changes (or anticipated changes) can create volatility.
    *   **Interest Rate Sensitivity:**  Clean energy companies can be sensitive to interest rate changes.
    *   **General Market Commentary:**  General articles highlighting clean energy ETFs as part of broader market discussions.

**5. Overall Assessment**

Based on the data provided, ICLN presents a mixed to negative investment picture.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   Significant historical underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High volatility (large drawdowns).
    *   Very negative long-term expected return.
    *   Sensitivity to political and macroeconomic factors (as highlighted by the news).

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   Recent short-term price improvement (but RSI suggests it might be overbought).
    *   Clean energy as a sector may have long-term growth potential (but this is not translating to ICLN's performance).

**Recommendation:**

Given the strong underperformance, high volatility, and negative expected return, investors should exercise extreme caution with ICLN. A thorough re-evaluation of the investment thesis is warranted. Investors should consider alternative clean energy investments or strategies.
