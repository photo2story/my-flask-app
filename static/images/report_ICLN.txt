2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Here's a breakdown of the ICLN ETF, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and analyzing recent trends.

**1. Return Rate and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **ICLN Company Overview:** iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) provides exposure to global equities in the clean energy sector.
*   **ICLN Cumulative Return:** 24.15%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 99.09%
*   **Divergence:** -74.8 (Relative Divergence: 4.4)

    **Analysis:**

    *   ICLN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Its cumulative return is far lower.
    *   The divergence of -74.8 indicates substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 4.4 suggests that the current divergence is near the bottom of its historical range.
    *   The Alpha, Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance.
    *   Alpha is overwhelmingly negative across most periods, indicating ICLN is underperforming relative to its benchmark. It had periods of very high positive Alpha (like 2018-2020, 2019-2021, 2020-2022), suggesting periods where it significantly outperformed, but more recently the Alpha has been very negative.
    *   Beta is generally low, indicating ICLN is not very reactive to broad market movement.
    *   MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently very high, indicating periods of significant losses.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 16.18
*   **Previous Close:** 16.00
*   **Change:** 1.12 (a small positive change)
*   **5-day SMA:** 16.33
*   **20-day SMA:** 16.56
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.62

    **Analysis:**

    *   The stock price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This *could* suggest a short-term downtrend, although the difference between the SMAs isn't huge, so it's not a strongly pronounced trend.
    *   The small positive change relative to the previous close indicates a slight upward movement recently.

**3. Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 33.60 (approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -0.44 (Slightly negative, indicating possible downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) - This is a system-generated signal suggesting a full investment (using all available cash) based on the MRI and other factors, labeling it as "Very Safe". The MRI used by this signal (0.90) is higher than the one provided separately.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.3 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -374.4 (Very negative long-term expectation)

    **Analysis:**

    *   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation.
    *   The RSI of 33.60 indicates that the asset is nearing oversold territory, which could signal a potential buying opportunity if you believe in a rebound.
    *   The negative PPO reinforces the possibility of a downtrend, but it is slight.
    *   The hybrid signal, recommending a full investment, seems contradictory given the other negative indicators and low expected return.  The discrepancy in the MRI values used is concerning and suggests a need to investigate the hybrid signal's methodology further.
    *   The negative 20-day relative divergence change indicates short-term downward pressure.
    *   The very negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting that the model predicts continued underperformance.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Liquidity Pulse:** An article mentioning ICLN as a liquidity pulse for institutional tactics.
*   **Clean Energy's Second Wind:** An article from Nasdaq discussing a potential resurgence for clean energy.
*   **ICLN: Clean Energy A Clear Winner In 2025:** A Seeking Alpha article with a rating upgrade, suggesting more gains ahead (from June 2025).
*   **Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights ICLN:** Mentions ICLN alongside other clean energy ETFs.
*   **Big Money Buys:** Reports an investment advisor making a significant purchase of a sector ETF (likely including ICLN).
*   **ICLN: An Overview:** Provides a general overview of ICLN's investment approach.

    **Analysis:**

    *   The news is mixed. There's some positive coverage (rating upgrade, "second wind," big money buys), but also more generic mentions. It's important to note the age of some of these articles. The "Clear Winner in 2025" article from June is significantly outdated given the current date, and the reported performance.
    *   The mention of "liquidity pulse" could be related to institutional trading strategies and might not be indicative of fundamental strength.
    *   Overall, the news doesn't paint a consistently bullish picture.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*Analyst Consensus:* Not provided.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

ICLN presents a mixed picture. Here's a summary:

*   **Underperformance:** ICLN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Downtrend Signals:** Recent price action and the PPO suggest a possible downtrend.
*   **Oversold Indicator:** The RSI is approaching oversold territory, which *could* signal a potential rebound.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The hybrid signal recommends a full investment but conflicts with the other negative indicators and the very negative expected return. The discrepancies in the MRI values used is concerning and suggests a need to investigate the hybrid signal's methodology further.
*   **Mixed News:** Recent news articles are mixed, with some positive sentiment from earlier in the year contrasting the recent performance data. The "Clear Winner in 2025" article has clearly not played out.
*   **High Risk:** The MDD indicates very high volatility and potential for significant losses.
*   **Negative Outlook:** The expected return of -374.4% is highly concerning and suggests a potentially very negative outlook.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, ICLN currently appears to be a risky investment. The underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the potential downtrend, and the negative expected return all raise significant concerns. The mixed news and the oversold RSI are the only mildly positive factors, but they are not enough to offset the overall negative assessment. Investors should exercise extreme caution and conduct further due diligence before considering investing in ICLN. The contradictory hybrid signal is also a significant red flag and requires further investigation.
