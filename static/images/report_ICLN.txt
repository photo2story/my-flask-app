| 2023-2025  | -77.0%  | 77.6%  | -115.0%  | 0.7    | 0.0   |

**Analysis of the Table:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate varies significantly across the years, with periods of strong growth (e.g., 2018-2020, 2019-2021) followed by substantial declines (e.g., 2021-2023, 2023-2025).
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk of substantial losses. MDD values are mostly high (near 100%), indicating severe drops from peak values during the specified periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha values show the ETF's performance relative to a benchmark. Negative alphas (especially large negative alphas like -115.0% in 2023-2025) indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark. Positive alphas (e.g., 89.0% in 2018-2020) indicate outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values vary, but generally, they are around 0, suggesting that the ETF does not move in tandem with the general market. This makes sense, considering it is a specific sector fund. Beta values close to 1 in later years indicate increasing correlation with the overall market, although this may be misleading due to the negative performance.

### 2. Recent Price Action

**Key Numbers:**

*   **Current Price:** 15.14
*   **Previous Close:** 15.19
*   **Price Change:** -0.33
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 15.18
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 14.71
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 14.08

**Analysis:**

The current price shows a small decrease from the previous close.  The 5-day moving average is slightly above the current price, while the 20-day and 60-day moving averages are below, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend that might be losing momentum. The price change of -0.33 suggests a minor downward pressure.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return

**Key Numbers:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.434 (Medium Risk)
*   **RSI:** 70.35 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.20
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 50% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.43)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** 1.0 (Positive - Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 2288.3% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI indicates a medium level of market risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is above 70, indicating an overbought condition, which might suggest a potential pullback.
*   **PPO:** The Positive Percentage Oscillator (PPO) is positive, suggesting a potential uptrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests using 50% of available cash to buy a single share, with a caution due to the MRI.
*   **Recent Relative Deviation Change:** The positive change in relative deviation indicates a recent short-term improvement in performance compared to VOO, but this needs to be viewed in the context of the overall underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (2288.3%) should be treated with significant skepticism. Such high projections are rarely, if ever, realized and likely based on overly optimistic assumptions.

**Analyst Consensus:** (No data provided)

### 5. Overall Assessment

ICLN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  Recent technical indicators suggest a possible short-term upward trend, but the RSI indicates an overbought condition. The long-term expected return is unrealistically high. The news headlines highlight the sector's vulnerability to political and economic factors.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **High Volatility:** The high MDD values in the Alpha/Beta analysis indicate that ICLN is a volatile investment.
*   **Political Sensitivity:** Investors should be aware of the political landscape and potential policy changes that could impact the clean energy sector.
*   **Risk Management:** Given the volatility and sensitivity to external factors, careful risk management is crucial.
*   **Realistic Expectations:** Avoid relying on overly optimistic expected return figures.

**In summary, while clean energy is an important sector with long-term growth potential, ICLN appears to be a high-risk investment with a history of underperformance. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in this ETF.**
