## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.  The provided data shows ALB's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  Specifically, ALB's cumulative return is -1.14% while VOO's is 114.28%.  The difference is a staggering -115.42%.  The relative divergence of -115.4 places ALB at the 1.7 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, indicating substantial underperformance.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in ALB's performance over the years, ranging from a high of 189% to a low of -180%.  This highlights the inherent risk associated with the stock, largely tied to the cyclical nature of the lithium market.  The consistently positive alpha suggests outperformance relative to the market in some periods, but the beta fluctuates, suggesting sensitivity to broader market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is $88.92.  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($95.19), 20-day ($103.46), and 60-day ($100.34) moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the moving averages suggests a potential for further downward movement, or a possible bounce if buying pressure increases.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (28.61):**  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.  This could indicate a potential bounce, but it's not a guarantee.
* **PPO (-2.05):** A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** The recent 20-day relative divergence of -2.5 confirms the short-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided expected return of 0% suggests that, based on the current data, the long-term (2+ years) return is projected to be approximately in line with the S&P 500, not exceeding it.  This is likely a conservative estimate given the inherent volatility of ALB and the lithium market.  The current price of $88.92, being significantly below the moving averages, does not suggest immediate upward potential, but the low RSI might hint at a short-term rebound.  A significant price jump would likely suggest a market-wide change of sentiment towards ALB and the commodity markets.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly results show a significant decline in revenue and profitability compared to the previous quarters. EPS plunged from $2.58 in 2023 Q4 to -$9.45 in 2024 Q3, a massive negative swing.  Revenue also declined substantially from $2.31B to $1.35B over the same period.  This sharp deterioration in earnings reflects a major downturn in the lithium market which has affected ALB heavily. The significant decline in Q3 2024 suggests a considerable miss versus any reasonable expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data reveals a concerning trend. Revenue has fallen significantly in the last two quarters, accompanied by substantial decreases in profit margins.  Equity has also declined, and the return on equity (ROE) has turned deeply negative, indicating significant financial pressure.  These figures support the downward pressure on the stock price.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ALB is currently experiencing a significant downturn.  The stock is trading below its moving averages, technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, and recent earnings have been dramatically worse than previous quarters.  While the oversold RSI might hint at a short-term bounce, the longer-term outlook remains uncertain, especially given the cyclical nature of the lithium market and the substantial decline in profitability. The expected return of 0% suggests that potential future returns relative to the S&P 500 are not currently attractive without anticipating a significant rebound in the lithium market and ALBâ€™s performance.  Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
