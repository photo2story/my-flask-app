* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $104.47

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (29.53):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-1.73):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-1.9):** Shows a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% suggests no significant S&P 500 outperformance is anticipated over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming a buy-and-hold strategy.  This should be interpreted cautiously;  this figure may not account for the potential volatility or market shifts in the longer-term period.


The closing price of $90.54, being significantly below the moving averages, does not reflect a recent significant price jump (upward or downward).  The lack of context on when this data was collected should be noted.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Albemarle's recent earnings show significant volatility:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuated between $1.35B and $2.36B over the past four quarters, indicating significant variability.
* **EPS:** Shows a sharp decline in the last two quarters (2024-07-31 and 2024-11-06) from positive levels in earlier quarters (2024-05-01 and 2023-11-01).  There is a discrepancy in the data; EPS and Revenue figures of 2.58 and 2.31B are repeated on 2024-11-06 and 2023-11-01 respectively.

There is no information provided on whether these earnings beat or missed expectations. The data alone reveals significant swings in both revenue and profitability.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is highly variable, and profit margins show substantial fluctuations, swinging from positive to deeply negative values over the reported period.  This instability highlights significant business risks.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity levels show some fluctuation but generally remain within a somewhat stable range. ROE also demonstrates considerable volatility, ranging from a positive 3.06% to a negative 10.44%.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook information was provided to supplement this analysis.  Analyst opinions would aid further evaluation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500. Recent earnings indicate considerable volatility in both revenue and profitability, and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The provided expected return of 0% and the erratic financial information raise concerns regarding its short-term prospects. Further research is needed to assess the long-term outlook and determine whether the current undervaluation, suggested by the relatively low price compared to moving averages and the oversold RSI, presents a buying opportunity.  The lack of earnings expectations and analyst opinions severely limits the ability to make a definitive assessment.  The repeated entries in the earnings table suggests data inconsistencies, which should be clarified before drawing conclusions.  A thorough review of news and analyst reports is recommended.
