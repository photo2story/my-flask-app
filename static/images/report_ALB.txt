* **Change:** -$2.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $78.77
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.95
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $94.78

The stock price is trading significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent price drop suggests a potential downward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 10.22 (Extremely oversold; potentially signaling a bounce, but also indicative of a weak trend)
* **PPO:** -1.28 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 6982.2% (This extremely high number requires further scrutiny and context.  It likely reflects a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 given the extremely low current price and valuation. The basis for this projection must be thoroughly investigated.)
* **Price Change:** The recent price drop of -$2.23 (-2.88%) while significant, doesn't alone indicate a *sudden* crash, but rather continues the established downward trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a concerning trend:

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45  | $1.35B      |
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96  | $1.43B      |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.08  | $1.36B      |
| 2023-11-01 | 2.58   | $2.31B      |
| 2024-11-06 | 2.58   | $2.31B      | *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*

There's a significant drop in EPS and a decline in revenue in the last few quarters, indicating potential operational challenges.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|

| 2024-03-31 | $1.36B | 2.86%       |

| 2024-06-30 | $11.22B  | -1.68%      |

| 2023-09-30 | $9.90B   | 3.06%       |

Both tables show a significant deterioration in profitability and return on equity in recent quarters.  This strongly supports the negative trend observed in the stock price and earnings data.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is currently experiencing a severe downturn.  The stock is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, showing negative returns across multiple metrics.  Recent earnings reports indicate declining revenue and substantial losses.  Technical indicators point towards an oversold condition, but the overall trend remains bearish. The extremely high projected long-term return needs validation and clarification.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the company's poor performance (e.g., market conditions, operational issues, strategic missteps) is crucial before considering any investment.  The data strongly suggests a high-risk investment at the current time.
