## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.  The cumulative return of ALB is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  The difference in cumulative returns between ALB (4.60%) and VOO (120.36%) is -115.8%.  This places ALB at the 1.7th percentile of the historical range of divergence between ALB and VOO, indicating substantial underperformance relative to the market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable performance for ALB across different time periods.  The CAGR, MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, and Beta fluctuate significantly, indicating a high-risk, high-reward investment with substantial market sensitivity (Beta consistently around 1.0-1.2).  The negative CAGRs and high MDDs in recent years (2022-2025) highlight considerable volatility.  The consistently positive alpha in previous years suggests ALB potentially outperformed the market during certain periods.  The extremely negative CAGR for 2022-2025, however, is a serious red flag.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $94.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $89.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $98.03

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price change of -$3.53 indicates a short-term decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.38 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought, but not indicating a strong buy signal)
* **PPO:** 1.43 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but not excessively strong)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.4 (Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 4245.9% (This exceptionally high expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs significant further justification and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  The calculation method is not provided and requires careful review.  Given the recent severe underperformance, this projection seems highly unlikely.)  The significant negative price change from the previous close reinforces concerns about the validity of the expected return.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility and recent losses.  The large losses in the last two quarters (2024-11-06 and 2024-07-31) contrast sharply with the previous profitability (2024-05-01 and 2023-11-01), signaling a potential downturn in the company's performance. The duplication of data in November 2024 needs clarification.  A more consistent reporting system is needed for proper analysis.

**5. Financial Information:**

The revenue shows a significant drop in the last quarter of 2023, followed by reduced but still relatively high revenue in the first half of 2024. The profit margins are highly unstable, swinging between positive and substantial negative values. Equity has fluctuated significantly but overall appears to be somewhat stable.  ROE (Return on Equity) reflects the profitability volatility, moving from positive to significant negative values over the period.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ALB has exhibited extreme volatility and significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in recent periods. While past periods showed periods of strong growth and positive alpha, current indicators point to substantial challenges: negative recent earnings, declining price, and significant underperformance against the market. The exceptionally high projected future return should be treated with significant skepticism given the current negative trends and volatility. The fundamental financial data displays instability and requires careful investigation into the reasons behind the recent sharp drops in profitability and revenue.  Further investigation into the reasons for the significant fluctuations and the high projected return is crucial before making any investment decisions. The data suggests ALB is a high-risk investment at present.
