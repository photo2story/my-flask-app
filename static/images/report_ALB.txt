**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $58.17

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $60.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $72.02

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)

* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -0.5 (Short-term bearish momentum)

The 4.55% price increase from the previous close indicates a potentially significant short-term upward bounce. The high expected return (14488.4%) projected over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 is likely based on a specific model and should be viewed with caution given the company's current financial state and high risk profile.  This projection might be overly optimistic.
