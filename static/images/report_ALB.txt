The difference is -104.0%, placing it at the 5.7th percentile of the historical range (-124.8% to 243.2%).  This indicates ALB's underperformance relative to the broader market.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (57.85):** Indicates a relatively neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (-0.0241):** Suggests a slightly bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence (20-day):** NaN (-) indicating a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0%  The provided data does not support a projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2 years or more).  The historical underperformance highlighted in section 1 casts doubt on the assumption of future outperformance.  A 0% expected return relative to the S&P500 is therefore a conservative assessment.
* **Last Market Price vs. Closing Price:** The closing price (107.70) being lower than the last market price (110.91) indicates a recent price drop, not a significant "sudden drop" or "sudden rebound."


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Albemarle's recent earnings show significant volatility.  The most recent quarter (2024-11-06) reveals a substantial loss (-9.45 EPS) and a slight revenue decrease ($1.35B), compared to the previous quarters which displayed a mix of positive and negative EPS and fluctuating revenue.  There's a significant drop in revenue from Q3 2023 ($2.31B) to Q3 2024 ($1.35B) which could signify a change in market conditions.  Revenue is inconsistent, with no clear upward or downward trend easily observable in the short term. EPS shows extreme volatility, with large swings from significant profits to significant losses between quarters. The lack of information regarding market expectations prevents an assessment of "beats" or "misses".


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates considerably, and profit margins swing between positive and negative values.  Q3 2024 shows a significant drop in revenue and profitability compared to previous quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has also shown fluctuations, and ROE reflects the instability in profitability. The significant negative ROE in the most recent quarter is a major concern.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided data does not contain any news or recent market outlook information. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing. To obtain this information, external resources such as financial news websites and analyst reports would need to be consulted.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing considerable volatility in both earnings and price.  The recent earnings report reveals significant losses and revenue decline. Technical indicators are mixed. Without additional information on market expectations, news, and analyst opinions, it's challenging to make a definitive recommendation.  The significantly negative ROE, the inconsistent revenue and the volatile and negative EPS in the most recent quarters present considerable risk. Based on the data provided, there is no clear indication of long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Further investigation into underlying causes of the recent financial downturn and external market factors is crucial before making any investment decisions.
