**6. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is currently experiencing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the negative earnings trend and the absence of key financial data raise serious concerns.

Before considering any investment, a deeper dive into the company's financials and a reassessment of the expected return figure are absolutely necessary.  The current situation warrants caution.
