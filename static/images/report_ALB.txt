## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a global leader in the production and sale of lithium and other specialty chemicals.  Over the given period, ALB's cumulative return (14.98%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return (122.07%). The difference represents a substantial underperformance of -107.1%, placing it in the 4th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This highlights a considerable risk and underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data shows high volatility with periods of significant gains and losses, emphasizing the cyclical nature of the business and its sensitivity to market conditions.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $103.87 (Last Market: $102.45)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $104.71
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $106.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $99.85

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.  The relatively small gap between the 5 and 20-day averages indicates a recent price consolidation; however, the significant difference with the 60-day MA suggests a more pronounced downward trend in the recent period.  The last market price of $102.45 doesn't indicate a significant recent jump or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 42.02 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.75 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** +0.4 (Short-term upward momentum, but limited in context with the moving averages)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0% (This indicates no expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, based on the provided data).

The technical indicators present a mixed signal.  While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the negative PPO and the price action relative to moving averages points towards continued downward pressure. The 0% expected return reinforces the risk.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings reveal a significant downturn in Q3 and Q4 2024 compared to previous quarters.  Revenue declined substantially in the last two quarters of 2024 (from $2.31B to $1.35B), showing a sharp negative trend. EPS plummeted to negative figures, indicating substantial losses in recent quarters compared to the positive EPS of previous quarters. The large swings in both revenue and EPS showcase the volatile nature of Albemarle's business.  No specific beat or miss versus expectations is provided.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data confirms the trend observed in the earnings report. Revenue decreased sharply in the last two quarters of 2024, leading to substantial negative profit margins.  Equity also decreased significantly in the final quarter of 2024.  The ROE shifted from positive to deeply negative figures, reflecting the substantial financial pressure the company faced in the last two quarters.  Overall, the financial health of Albemarle appears to have worsened considerably in the last two reported quarters.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the given period.  Recent earnings and financial data paint a concerning picture of a substantial downturn, marked by declining revenue, negative EPS and profit margins, and reduced equity. The technical indicators offer a mixed signal, but the price action relative to moving averages and the 0% projected long-term excess return relative to the S&P 500 do not suggest a compelling investment case at this time.  Further analysis is needed, including the missing news and analyst opinions, to create a more complete picture.  The high volatility observed historically should also be considered.  Currently, the risk-reward profile appears unfavorable.
