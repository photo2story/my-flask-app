*   **Analysis:** The table reveals a volatile performance history. While some periods show exceptional growth (e.g., 2019-2021, 2020-2022), recent years (2022-2025) have been significantly negative. High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values across all periods indicate substantial risk. The Alpha values reflect ALB's performance relative to a benchmark, with negative alpha suggesting underperformance in many periods. Beta values are generally low, indicating lower systematic risk compared to the overall market, though the negative beta in 2019-2021 is notable. The company's market capitalization has also fluctuated.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **Current Price:** $88.22
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $88.22, Previous Close: $87.61, Change: $0.7
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** $84.37
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $81.03
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $78.53

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The recent price increase from $87.61 to $88.22, with a change of $0.7, is a slight positive movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 62.99 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.70 (Positive, indicating a potential uptrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** 0.1 (+) - Short-term Increase
*   **Expected Return:** 1627.6% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, which is surprising given the recent performance.  The RSI near 63 indicates the stock is approaching overbought conditions, suggesting caution. The positive PPO supports the short-term upward trend. The Hybrid Signal strongly recommends buying. The exceptionally high expected return (1627.6%) should be viewed with skepticism and requires further validation, as it seems unrealistic.  The positive change in relative deviation confirms the recent short-term price increase. The slight increase from the previous close of $87.61 to $88.22, while positive, isn't a significant 'spike' requiring immediate reassessment unless correlated with high volume.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|

| 2025-08-04 | -1.96  | 1.43 B$   |

**Analysis:**  The recent EPS figures are concerning, with most quarters showing losses. Revenue has been fluctuating, but generally declining. The EPS of -9.45 in Nov 2024 is a significant loss.  This poor earnings performance likely contributes to the stock's underperformance.

Return on Equity (ROE) is low and negative in some periods, indicating poor profitability relative to equity.  Equity has also seen some volatility.

**7. Overall Analysis & Recommendation:**

Albemarle (ALB) presents a mixed picture. While the Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a "High Investment Recommended," many other indicators raise concerns:

*   **Negative Performance:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Earnings Losses:** Recent EPS figures are mostly negative.
*   **Inconsistent Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue and profit margins have fluctuated significantly.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analysts are neutral, and target prices have a wide range.
*   **High Risk:** High MDD values highlight the stock's volatility.

**However, there are some potentially positive signals:**

*   **Short-Term Uptrend:** The current price is above moving averages, and the PPO is positive.
*   **Lithium Sector Potential:** Positive news in the lithium sector could benefit ALB.
*   **Extremely High Expected Return:** This figure is questionable but warrants further investigation.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. While the MRI and potential for high long-term returns might be enticing, the company's recent performance and financial metrics raise significant concerns.

*   **If you are a risk-averse investor, it is recommended to stay away from this stock.**
*   **If you are a high-risk investor, a small allocation might be considered, but thorough due diligence is essential. Pay close attention to the upcoming earnings release and any news related to the lithium market.**
