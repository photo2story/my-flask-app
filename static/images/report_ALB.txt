## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.  As of the last data point, ALB's cumulative return is 28.18%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 125.68%.  The difference is -97.5%, placing it at the 7.42 percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-124.79% to 243.23%).  This indicates ALB has underperformed the market significantly over the period considered.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $109.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $105.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $100.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $94.83

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages implies the uptrend is not very strong.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 64.71 - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but approaching overbought territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.53 - A positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +3.87 - Shows a recent short-term upward trend in the relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided data shows a 0% expected return over a long-term horizon (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500. This suggests that based on the available information,  investors should not expect to outperform the market.  Given the current price of $109.55 is not unusually high compared to recent history, there is no obvious sign of a sudden surge or drop. Further analysis and consideration of market context is needed.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue. Recent quarters show net losses, possibly due to short-term market headwinds or factors specific to Albemarle. More detailed information on the company's earnings calls and filings are required to fully assess their performance and future outlook. The latest earnings report of $1.35B revenue and -$9.45 EPS should be compared to analyst expectations to determine if it was a positive or negative surprise.  Without this context, it's difficult to draw meaningful conclusions.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The revenue and profitability data exhibits inconsistent performance. While some quarters show positive profit margins, others show substantial losses (-29.88% in Q4 2023). The capital and profitability data mirrors this trend, with ROE fluctuating between positive and significantly negative values. This suggests significant operational challenges or market-specific pressures affecting Albemarle's financial performance.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the period analyzed. While recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, the company's financial performance has been volatile, with significant losses reported in recent quarters.  Technical indicators are mixed, and the expected return is 0% relative to the S&P 500.  A thorough review of recent news, analyst reports, and the latest earnings call transcripts is crucial to assess the underlying reasons for underperformance and predict future prospects.  The company's dependence on commodity prices (lithium) makes it particularly vulnerable to market fluctuations.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the recent losses and projections for future lithium demand is necessary before making any investment decisions.
