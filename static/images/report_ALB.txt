## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**0) Overview:**

Albemarle Corp is a global leader in the production and marketing of lithium, bromine, and related chemicals.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

ALB's cumulative return (-15.74%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 108.62%.  The difference is -124.4%, placing it at the 3.3rd percentile of the historical range (-136.4% to 228.8%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile performance and inconsistent alpha and beta values across the observed periods.  There's no clear trend indicating consistent outperformance or underperformance relative to the market (as measured by Beta). High volatility is evident from the large swings in CAGR and significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  Note that the provided CAGR figures are extremely high or low and seem unlikely to be realistic for such short periods.  Further investigation into the data source's accuracy is recommended.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 102.0% | 5.3% | 74.0% | 0.2 | 13.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 4.0% | 18.4% | -14.0% | 0.4 | 8.4 |
| 2017-2019  | -53.0% | 18.4% | -83.0% | 0.1 | 8.1 |
| 2018-2020  | 45.0% | 29.8% | 18.0% | -0.2 | 16.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 189.0% | 29.8% | 118.0% | -0.3 | 26.7 |
| 2020-2022  | 144.0% | 29.8% | 136.0% | -0.2 | 24.9 |
| 2021-2023  | -62.0% | 25.1% | -86.0% | 0.9 | 16.7 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $75.51
* 5-Day Moving Average: $73.66
* 20-Day Moving Average: $77.88
* 60-Day Moving Average: $86.40

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish trend.  The recent close is also below the previous close, indicating a downward movement.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 39.27 (below 50, suggesting oversold conditions)
* PPO: -0.087 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* 20-Day Relative Strength Divergence: +1.7 (short-term upward trend)

The conflicting signals from the RSI and PPO, coupled with the price being below moving averages, create uncertainty.  The positive relative strength divergence suggests a potential short-term upward bounce. However, the significant price drop (-1.27%) from the previous close should be considered, implying recent market volatility or negative news.


**Expected Return:**  The provided 1845.8% expected return seems unrealistically high and requires further clarification on the methodology used to calculate this figure.  The statement that this is an S&P 500 excess return over a two-year period needs significant justification.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There are large swings in both EPS and revenue, with significant negative EPS figures in recent quarters.  The duplication of the 2024-11-06 data point needs clarification.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|

ALB's performance has been significantly worse than the S&P 500 over the period reviewed.  The provided data shows highly volatile financial results and significant inconsistencies in key metrics.  The high and low CAGR values, coupled with negative EPS and profit margins in several quarters raise concerns about the company's current financial health and future outlook.  The extremely high projected return needs serious scrutiny.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence is strongly recommended, including verifying the accuracy and source of the provided data and investigating the reasons for the extreme volatility and negative earnings.  Consider consulting with a financial advisor.
