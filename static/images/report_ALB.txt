**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, and Related Metrics:**

*   **Alpha:** Alpha consistently mirrors the CAGR, indicating that the provided Alpha is simply the excess return over a benchmark with zero risk-free rate and beta.

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows high volatility. Recent periods (2021-2025) show significant negative growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial risk, especially in recent years, reflecting considerable losses from peak to trough.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has decreased over the more recent periods, suggesting a decline in investor confidence or overall valuation.

The model suggests the estimated excess returns compared to the S&P 500 if the investment is held for a longer term.
