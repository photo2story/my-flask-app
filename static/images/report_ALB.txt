**Detailed Analysis**

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Cumulative Return Difference:** ALB's cumulative return is -10.21%, while VOO's is 69.12%. This results in a substantial difference of -82.5%.
*   **Relative Divergence:** The relative divergence of 1.9 suggests ALB is performing near the lower end of its historical range compared to VOO. This is a significant underperformance and suggests investors should proceed with caution.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**
    The provided table shows Alpha and Beta values for various 3-year periods. Key takeaways:
    *   **Alpha:** Varies significantly, indicating periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. The more recent periods show substantial negative alpha, indicating significant underperformance.
    *   **Beta:**  Mostly close to 0 or negative, suggesting low correlation with the market. However, more recent betas are closer to 1, which means ALB is moving more like the general stock market (S&P 500).
    *   **CAGR:** The compounded annual growth rate is negative in the most recent periods.
    *   **MDD:** The maximum drawdown is very high, so be careful.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movements**

*   **Current Price:** 81.54
*   **Last Market Change:** The stock rose by 1.77, indicating a slight positive movement.
*   **Moving Averages:** The 5-day (80.96), 20-day (80.23), and 60-day (76.60) moving averages show a recent upward trend, with the shorter-term averages above the longer-term averages.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.434 indicates Medium Risk.
*   **RSI (54.31):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating neutral momentum.
*   **PPO (0.0413):**  A positive PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, confirming the recent upward price trend, but the value is very small.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests reducing holdings to 20% and increasing cash to 80%, reflecting a risky environment (MRI 0.42).
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** A change of 0.0 in relative divergence indicates no recent change in underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:**  A high expected return of 5290.7% is very optimistic and potentially unreliable.  It suggests significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years), but this should be viewed with extreme skepticism.

**7. Overall Assessment**

Based on the provided data, Albemarle (ALB) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Signals:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, recent unprofitability (negative EPS), and volatile financial performance (profit margins, ROE) are concerning.
*   **Positive Signals:** Recent news suggests a potential positive catalyst for the lithium market. Short-term stock price movement shows a slight upward trend. Analysts have a "Hold" rating, and the Market Risk Indicator is at a Medium level.

**Conclusion:**

ALB has been underperforming and faces financial challenges. However, the positive momentum in the lithium market and the potential for government investment could provide a turnaround. The significant divergence from the S&P 500 and the recent negative alpha values are major red flags. The high expected return seems unrealistic given the recent performance.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals and significant risks, a **cautious approach is warranted**.  Before investing, further research is necessary to understand the potential impact of government investment on Albemarle, the sustainability of the upward price trend, and the reasons for the recent unprofitability. Investors should carefully evaluate their risk tolerance and consider the potential for further underperformance. The recommendation from the Hybrid Signal is to reduce holdings and increase cash.
