2026-01-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive report on Albemarle Corp (ALB), based on the data you provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Divergence:**

*   **Company Overview:** Albemarle Corp is a specialty chemicals manufacturing company, primarily focused on lithium, bromine, and catalysts.
*   **ALB Cumulative Return:** 28.51%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** -62.5 (Relative Divergence: 19.1)

**Analysis:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The -62.5 divergence means ALB's cumulative return lags the S&P 500 by a substantial margin. The relative divergence of 19.1 suggests that the current divergence is near the low end of its historical range (meaning it has diverged this much or more only about 19% of the time). This *could* imply that the underperformance is relatively extreme, potentially indicating a future opportunity, but more analysis is needed.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|------|--------|

| 2018-2020  | 50.0%   | 29.5%  | 29.0%   | 1.2  | 17.6   |
| 2019-2021  | 140.0%  | 29.5%  | 96.0%   | 1.3  | 27.9   |
| 2020-2022  | 134.0%  | 28.5%  | 136.0%  | 1.3  | 25.9   |
| 2021-2023  | -26.0%  | 53.3%  | -27.0%  | 1.5  | 17.3   |
| 2022-2024  | -139.0% | 68.7%  | -158.0% | 1.5  | 10.3   |
| 2023-2025  | -165.0% | 74.5%  | -227.0% | 1.8  | 16.9   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Recent CAGR figures are very negative, especially in the last few periods. This confirms the recent underperformance.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values are high and increasing, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is consistently negative and increasingly negative recently. This indicates that ALB is significantly underperforming its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) after accounting for market risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently above 1, and trending higher, meaning ALB is more volatile than the S&P 500. Increased Beta (1.8 most recently) suggests increased sensitivity to market fluctuations.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has been decreasing significantly in recent years, from 27.9B to 16.9B, with the company’s market position deteriorating.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 143.93
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 146.13, Previous Close: 143.93, Change: 1.53
*   **5-day SMA:** 144.394
*   **20-day SMA:** 137.414
*   **60-day SMA:** 116.0927

**Analysis:**  The price is above the 5-day SMA, suggesting a very short-term upward trend. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, indicating a short-term upward trend. The 20-day SMA is well above the 60-day SMA, confirming a more significant longer-term upward trend. However, the large change (1.53) in the last market data reflects the fluctuation issue.

**3) RSI, PPO Index, and Other Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 63.53
*   **PPO:** -0.717
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (3 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** -0.6 (downward trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 16.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A Medium Investment recommendation suggests moderate risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 63.53 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70).  This suggests that the stock *may* be due for a pullback.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO (-0.717) indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, signaling a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The "Buy 90% of cash" signal, while deemed "Safe" with an MRI of 0.8, conflicts somewhat with the technical indicators that hint at a possible pullback.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change confirms the recent underperformance relative to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** The 16.5% expected return is promising, suggesting that analysts believe the stock is undervalued and will recover in the long term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Catalysts:**
    *   **Lithium Deficit:** UBS believes a lithium deficit could boost ALB stock.
    *   **Call Option Buying:** Investors are buying call options, indicating bullish sentiment.
    *   **Analyst Upgrades:** Bullish analyst upgrades cite lithium demand and supply deficits.
    *   **Lithium Prices Spike:** Rising lithium prices are boosting the stock, with analysts raising targets.
    *   **AI Play:** Lithium is becoming an AI play, benefiting Albemarle.
*   **General Sentiment:**  The news is predominantly positive, focusing on increased lithium demand and potential supply shortages.

**5) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.42)
*   **Opinions:** 23
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 125.49 / High: 200.00 / Low: 75.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** (No specific changes provided, just placeholder arrows)

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Buy," which is a positive indicator. However, the average target price (125.49) is *below* the current price (146.13), suggesting that analysts, on average, believe the stock is currently overvalued. The wide range between the high and low target prices (75 to 200) indicates significant disagreement among analysts about the stock's potential.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -1.72 | 1.31 B$      |

| 2025-11-05 | -9.45 | 1.35 B$      |

**Analysis:**  The recent EPS figures are very concerning, with significant losses reported in most recent quarters.  Revenue has fluctuated, with a noticeable drop in the 2025-04-30 period. Negative EPS figures despite significant revenue signal issues with profitability, such as increased operating costs or decreased margins.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:**  Revenue has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations.
*   **Profit Margin:** The significant fluctuation in profit margin, including a negative value in 2024-09-30, is concerning and requires investigation. Recent profit margins have improved but are not consistent.
*   **Equity:** Equity has remained relatively stable.
*   **ROE:**  Return on Equity (ROE) has been very low and even negative in some quarters. This indicates that the company is not effectively generating profits from its equity.  The sharp decline in ROE is especially alarming.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Albemarle (ALB) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Strong tailwinds from increased lithium demand and potential supply deficits are fueling positive news and analyst sentiment.
    *   A relatively high expected return (16.5%) signals potential long-term growth, if you are a very long term investor
    *   MRI shows a Medium investment recommendation.

*   **Negatives:**
    *   ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and this underperformance is worsening.
    *   Analyst average price target is BELOW current price.
    *   Recent earnings (EPS) are very poor.
    *   ROE is low and negative.
    *   The stock is volatile (high Beta).
    *   Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) suggest a possible pullback.
    *   The large drawdown and increasingly negative Alpha values reflect a deterioration in performance.
*   **Overall Assessment:**

While the long-term outlook for lithium and the positive news headlines are encouraging, the negative financial performance, negative earnings, and technical indicators raise significant concerns. The market risk indicator suggests a medium level of risk which does not quite match up with the negative fundamentals.
