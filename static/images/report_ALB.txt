**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine, critical materials for batteries and other industrial applications.  The provided data shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) in the recent period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this underperformance and the outlook for future performance.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **ALB Cumulative Return:** 93.22%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 65.78%
* **Return Difference:** -64.8%  (ALB underperformed VOO by 64.8%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 0.1 (This indicates ALB's performance relative to VOO is at the 10th percentile of historical divergence, based on a range from -65.2% to 308%.)

The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta data shows highly volatile performance over time.  While there have been periods of significant outperformance (e.g., 2019-2021), recent periods (2022-2025 projections) indicate substantial losses.  The high Beta values (mostly above 0.0, even reaching 2.1) suggest ALB is significantly more volatile than the overall market.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45  | $1.35 B       |
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96  | $1.43 B       |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.08  | $1.36 B       |
| 2023-11-01 | 2.58   | $2.31 B       |
| 2024-11-06 | 2.58   | $2.31 B       |

There's a discrepancy in the data (2 entries for 2024-11-06).  The most recent quarters show significant losses, which likely contributed to the recent price decline.  A sharp drop in revenue from Q4 2023 to subsequent quarters is also evident.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.23B | 11.22% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.35B | -7.68% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.43B | -0.74% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.36B | 2.86% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.36B | -29.88% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.96B | 0.76% |
| 2024-09-30 | $10.24B | -10.44% |
| 2024-06-30 | $11.22B | -1.68% |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.53B | 0.02% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.41B | -6.56% |

The financial data confirms a significant deterioration in profitability and a decline in revenue in recent quarters.  ROE is also significantly negative in recent periods.  This financial weakness likely explains the stock's poor performance.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

ALB has experienced a sharp decline in recent months, driven by significantly weaker-than-expected earnings and a downturn in the lithium market.  The stock is currently trading below its moving averages, and technical indicators suggest bearish momentum.  While the long-term expected return is presented as high, it requires validation given the current financial state and recent price action.  Investors should carefully consider the significant risks associated with ALB before making any investment decisions. Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent earnings decline and the outlook for the lithium market is crucial.  The high volatility and Beta value highlight the substantial risk associated with this stock.
