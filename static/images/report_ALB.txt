CAGR and MDD values of 0.0% indicate no growth and no drawdown over each period, which is highly unusual. The decreasing Cap(B) suggests a shrinking market capitalization over the period.

*   **Current Price:** 61.08
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 61.08, Previous Close: 61.86, Change: -1.26
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 59.976
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 57.618
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 67.1042

**Analysis:** The stock price closed lower than the previous day.  The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average, which could be seen as a short-term bullish sign. However, the current price is below the 60-day moving average, which suggests a longer-term bearish trend.

**3. Market Risk and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.0 (Low Risk range is 0.45~0.35, Medium Risk is 0.4~0.3, High Risk is 0.5~0.65)
*   **RSI:** 59.297
*   **PPO:** 1.7369
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** 0.0 (Indicates short-term decline)
*   **Recent Change:** The last market data shows a price decrease, indicating a slight downward pressure.
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0% (Long-term excess return vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI of 0.0 is significantly outside the defined risk ranges, making it difficult to interpret without further context.  An RSI of 59.297 suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory but is not there yet. A positive PPO indicates the 20-day EMA is above the 60-day EMA, suggesting a potential uptrend, but it should be read with the general context. The recent decline and zero expected return are concerning.
