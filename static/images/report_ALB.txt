**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출        |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -1.72   | 1.31 B$     |
| 2025-08-04 | -0.16   | 1.33 B$     |

*   **Analysis:** The Earnings Per Share (EPS) has been mostly negative, with large losses. This is a major warning sign. Revenue has been fluctuating, but not enough to offset the losses. The repeating date and numbers of 2025-11-05 is likely an error.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue     | Profit Margin |

|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $10.00B     | -1.61%    |

| 2024-09-30   | $10.24B     | -10.44%   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but has generally been around $1.3 Billion. The recent drop in revenue is concerning.
    *   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have been inconsistent, and, most importantly, show negative values. This is a red flag, mirroring the EPS issues.
    *   **Equity:** Equity has remained relatively stable.
    *   **ROE:**  Return on Equity (ROE) has been low or negative, which indicates poor profitability relative to shareholder equity. The negative ROE is aligned with negative EPS and low profit margins.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Albemarle (ALB) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Signals:**  ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating a large negative divergence.  Recent earnings are poor, with consistently negative EPS and low/negative profit margins and ROE. Analyst target prices are *below* the current price. The negative PPO suggests bearish momentum. The increasing MDD, Alpha, and Beta values are also warning signs.
*   **Positive Signals:**  The Market Risk Indicator suggests a medium level of investment risk.  The news flow is mixed, with some positive headlines about lithium demand.  There's a high expected return, but this may be based on overly optimistic assumptions that are not being reflected in recent news.
*   **Neutral Signals:**  The stock price is fluctuating, with the RSI approaching overbought territory, implying possible fluctuation.

**Conclusion:**  Based on the data, caution is warranted. The fundamental financial metrics (earnings, profit margins, ROE) are weak. Although the MRI indicates moderate risk and the expected return is high, the negative earnings, negative analyst sentiment, high drawdown, and relative divergence strongly suggest that Albemarle faces significant challenges. I'd recommend caution, and more research is needed to assess the root cause and likelihood of a turnaround before considering a new investment. Existing investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance.
