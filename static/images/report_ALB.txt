**6) Financial Information:**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31   | $1.08B     | 14.51%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $1.23B     | 11.22%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $1.35B     | -7.68%        |
| 2024-06-30   | $1.43B     | -0.74%        |
| 2024-03-31   | $1.36B     | 2.86%         |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE     |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| 2025-03-31   | $10.03B    | 0.41%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $9.96B    | 0.76%   |
| 2024-09-30   | $10.24B    | -10.44%  |
| 2024-06-30   | $11.22B    | -1.68%  |
| 2024-03-31   | $11.53B    | 0.02%   |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has decreased in the most recent quarter. More significantly, the profit margin has fluctuated and was negative for two quarters. This aligns with the negative EPS reported. Equity has also decreased, leading to fluctuating and generally low ROE figures, indicating profitability challenges.

**7) Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp. is facing significant challenges. While the MRI indicates low market risk, several factors suggest caution:

*   **Underperformance:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Earnings & Profitability:** Recent earnings are negative, and profit margins have been inconsistent and sometimes negative.
*   **Recent News:** News indicates volatility and major developments that require careful monitoring.
*   **Downtrend:** The stock price is below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a downtrend.
*   **Equity & ROE**: Equity has generally decreased, leading to fluctuating and generally low ROE figures, indicating profitability challenges.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The RSI is approaching overbought territory.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach to ALB is warranted. Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative earnings, declining profit margins, and recent news events is essential before considering an investment. The extraordinarily high expected return estimate is likely unrealistic and should not be used as a primary factor in decision-making. The potential benefits of a long-term investment do not currently outweigh the risk.
