**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a specialty chemicals company that produces and sells lithium and bromine-based products.  Over the period analyzed, ALB's cumulative return (8.45%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 120.85%.  The provided data shows a substantial lag of -112.4 percentage points. The relative divergence of -112.4 places ALB in the 2.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating a considerable underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $97.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $100.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $105.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $100.29

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (37.66):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible, but not guaranteed.
* **PPO (-1.26):** A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-2.0):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% indicates that, based on the available data, there is no anticipated excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is a crucial finding and merits further investigation into the underlying assumptions of this projection.  A 0% expected return suggests that the investment might not outperform the benchmark index, raising the need to scrutinize the investment's potential and rationale.  The current price of $97.55 does not trigger any alert regarding a sudden surge or decline based on solely this parameter. Further analysis would be required.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings show a significant decline in both EPS and revenue in the last two quarters (ending 2024-07-31 and 2024-11-06).   Specifically:

* **EPS Trend:** A sharp drop from $2.58 in 2023-11-01 to -$9.45 in 2024-11-06 indicates a substantial decline in profitability.
* **Revenue Trend:**  While revenue in Q2 2024 ($1.43B) and Q3 2024 ($1.35B) is relatively stable compared to earlier periods, it marks a considerable decrease from the $2.31B revenue of Q3 2023.  This demonstrates a decline in the company's top-line growth.

The data reveals a concerning pattern of significantly deteriorating profitability.  A further detailed analysis would be necessary to understand the reasons behind this sharp downturn.  The report lacks information regarding the expected earnings, preventing the assessment of "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data reveals a deterioration in both revenue and profitability in the last two quarters.  Profit margins have turned significantly negative, and Return on Equity (ROE) has also dropped substantially, signaling a worrying trend in the company's financial health.  The decrease in Equity over this period may reflect the lower profitability, and more detailed analysis would be needed to understand the underlying factors behind the financial performance decline.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided data does not include recent news, market outlook, or analyst opinions to provide a complete picture. This critical information is necessary to supplement the quantitative analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ALB's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  The company shows a troubling decline in profitability and revenue, reflected in negative EPS and profit margins. Technical indicators show the stock in oversold territory but with bearish momentum.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive assessment.  Based on the available data, the investment case for ALB is currently weak, particularly given the projected 0% excess return relative to the S&P 500. Further investigation is needed to determine the reasons behind the recent financial downturn and assess the prospects for future recovery.  The absence of crucial market context and analyst perspectives significantly hinders a thorough evaluation of the stock.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data, a more cautious approach is warranted.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent significant decline in earnings and revenue is needed.  Thorough analysis of recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is required to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the future prospects of ALB before making any investment decisions.
