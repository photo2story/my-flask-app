## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.  The cumulative return of ALB is 26.02%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 130.06%. The difference is -104.0%, placing it at the 5.7th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates ALB's underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently shows negative values (-0.1), suggesting underperformance relative to the market benchmark, further corroborating the underperformance indicated by the cumulative return difference.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $107.70 (Last Market: $108.17)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $108.17
* **20-day Moving Average:** $104.64
* **60-day Moving Average:** $97.01

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent slight downward pressure.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, hinting at potential upward momentum in the medium to long term.  The recent closing price ($108.17) being slightly above its last reported market value implies no significant sharp upward or downward movement in the day.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.85 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.0241 (Slightly bearish)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (-) (Indicates a short-term downward trend, likely because the NaN shows that the relative divergence is unavailable. This can happen when there is not enough data to calculate it)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates a projection of no outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term).

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. The RSI suggests neutrality, while the negative PPO indicates bearish momentum. The missing relative divergence data and zero expected return signal a need for caution and further analysis before committing to long-term investment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings reports show significant volatility.  Revenue has fluctuated, with a notable drop in the last two quarters (from $2.31B to $1.35B).  EPS shows major losses in Q3 and Q4 2024, contrasting sharply with a positive EPS in Q1 2024 and earlier quarters.  There is no information available about earnings expectations to evaluate whether the company has "beat" or "missed" those projections.  The significant drop in both revenue and profit margin over the past two quarters is a very concerning observation.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data reveals a concerning trend.  Revenue has seen a sharp decline in the last two quarters. Profit margins have fallen into negative territory in the most recent quarters, indicating significant financial challenges. The Equity also declined considerably in Q4 2023.  ROE has also been significantly negative for the last two quarters. This all points to severe financial instability of the company over the last two quarters.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:**  The provided data indicates significant losses in the most recent quarters (Q3 and Q4 2024), a considerable drop in revenue and a considerable deterioration of financial health.  (Note:  No specific news headlines or articles were provided, so this is based on the earnings data.)
* **Recent Market Outlook/Analyst Opinions:**  No information about market outlook or analyst opinions was included in the provided data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ALB shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the period reviewed.  Recent financial results point to considerable trouble, with significant declines in both revenue and EPS.   Technical indicators are mixed, but the financial data warrants considerable caution.   The negative alpha and consistently declining financial performance across multiple quarters create substantial investment risks.  The lack of positive news and the missing context regarding analyst opinions and market expectations prevent a comprehensive outlook, but the available information strongly suggests a bearish trend.  Given the current state, further investigation is strongly recommended before any investment decision is made.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the significant underperformance, volatile earnings, and negative financial trends, a long-term investment in ALB at this time should be approached with extreme caution.  Additional research is strongly recommended, including a review of analyst expectations, broader market sentiment and a deep dive into the reasons for ALB's recent poor financial performance.  Investors should carefully weigh the substantial risks before considering any investment.
