**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜        | EPS   | 매출       |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-11-05  | -1.72 | 1.31 B$    |
| 2025-08-04  | -0.16 | 1.33 B$    |
| 2025-04-30  | 0     | 1.08 B$    |
| 2024-11-06  | -9.45 | 1.35 B$    |
| 2025-11-05  | -9.45 | 1.35 B$    |

*   **Analysis:** Recent earnings reports are concerning. EPS (Earnings Per Share) is negative in most recent quarters, and sharply negative for the last two years, although revenue is relatively stable. This suggests potential issues with profitability, increasing costs, or other factors impacting the bottom line. This is a red flag and should be investigated further. There appears to be duplicate data in the table.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue:** Relatively stable, fluctuating around $1.3 billion per quarter, except for a dip in 2025-03-31.
    *   **Profit Margin:** Variable. A negative profit margin in 2024-09-30 is a concern. Profit margins improved in the first three quarters of 2025.
    *   **Equity:**  Relatively stable around $10 billion.
    *   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is negative in two of the quarters reported. This, combined with the negative EPS figures, is a major area of concern, indicating the company is not effectively generating profits from shareholder equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Albemarle Corp. is currently a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Recent positive price momentum.
    *   Favorable news related to lithium prices and analyst target price increases.
    *   "Buy" analyst consensus (although average target price is below current price).
    *   High expected return (long-term).

*   **Negatives:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High historical volatility (high MDD).
    *   Negative and inconsistent alpha.
    *   Concerningly *negative* EPS figures for recent quarters.
    *   Negative or very low ROE, indicating poor profitability relative to equity.
    *   Analyst average target price below current price, suggesting potential overvaluation.

**Conclusion:**

While recent price action and analyst sentiment might seem encouraging, the underlying financial performance (negative EPS, low ROE) raises significant concerns. The high historical volatility and underperformance compared to the S&P 500 should also be considered. The extremely high "expected return" should be treated with skepticism until the company demonstrates a sustained improvement in profitability. Before making any investment decisions, investors should conduct thorough due diligence and carefully consider the company's financial statements. Investors may want to consider awaiting improvements to the company's financials before investing.
