## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading producer of lithium and other specialty chemicals.  The provided data shows ALB's cumulative return of 21.38% significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 120.73% over the unspecified period. The difference is -99.3%, placing it at the 6.2 percentile of the historical range of the relative performance spread (max: 228.8, min: -121.0).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $109.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $105.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $106.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $99.37

The price is currently trading above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. However, the relatively small difference between the price and the 20-day MA indicates limited momentum.  The last-market price of $109.71 doesn't indicate a significant recent surge or plummet, although more granular data would clarify the daily movements.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.97 (slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.54 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.6 (downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This is a stated expected return and requires additional context to be meaningful.)  The provided 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) needs further clarification and justification.  This metric requires a complete understanding of the underlying model used for the prediction.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported earnings reveal a significant drop in both EPS and revenue in Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024 and previous years.  There's a dramatic shift from profitability in Q1 2024 and Q3 2023 to significant losses in Q2, Q3, and Q4 2024. This volatility highlights substantial changes in profitability, potentially linked to market conditions affecting lithium prices and demand. The duplicated data entry for 2024-11-06 needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data shows significant fluctuations in profitability and equity.  Profit margins swung from positive to deeply negative within a year.  Equity also experienced substantial decreases in some quarters.  These wild swings suggest significant sensitivity to external market forces and the inherent volatility of the commodity market.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

The prompt lacks information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions. This crucial information is necessary for a comprehensive analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ALB's performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent periods, showing high volatility in both earnings and share price.  The recent quarterly results paint a concerning picture of reduced revenue and substantial losses.  While the technical indicators provide a mixed signal, the fundamentally weak earnings and lack of positive news suggest a cautious outlook.  The missing market outlook and analyst opinions prevent a complete assessment of the current market sentiment.  The provided long-term expected return of 0% requires more information and context to be meaningful.  Further investigation into the drivers of recent losses and future market projections is critical before making any investment decisions.
