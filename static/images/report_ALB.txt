## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.  The provided data shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying reasons for this divergence.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ALB's cumulative return (7.84%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return (82.57%).  The provided divergence metrics (-74.7, 0.0) indicate ALB's substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, placing it at the lowest percentile based on historical data.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance over time.  While periods of high CAGR (e.g., 2019-2021, 2020-2022) demonstrate significant outperformance (high alpha), other periods show considerable underperformance, even negative returns.  The high beta values (often above 8) suggest ALB is highly sensitive to overall market movements.  The fluctuating Beta suggests that the company's sensitivity to market risk has been inconsistent over time.  This volatility necessitates a careful risk assessment.

* **Closing Price:** 58.17
* **Last Market Price:** 60.3 (1.65 increase from previous close)
* **5-day MA:** 54.90
* **20-day MA:** 60.36
* **60-day MA:** 72.02

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average but significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend.  The last market price shows a sudden jump (+1.65), which warrants further investigation for potential news or events driving this change.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **MRI:** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.60 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** 0.2892 (Positive, but relatively low)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.5 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 14488.4% (This extraordinarily high value requires careful examination and likely reflects a significant error in calculation or a misunderstanding of the data's meaning.  This figure needs further clarification and validation).

The last market price increase of 1.65 might indicate a brief upward bounce, but the overall indicators suggest caution. The extremely high expected return needs to be investigated.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-04-30 | 0     | $1.08B      |
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45 | $1.35B      |
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96 | $1.43B      |

| 2025-04-30 | -0.08 | $1.36B      |


The recent earnings show significant volatility and losses in several quarters.  The large negative EPS in Q4 2024 (-9.45) is particularly concerning and needs further investigation. The revenue remains relatively stable, but the lack of profitability is a major red flag.

| 2024-06-30 | $11.22B | -1.68%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.53B | 0.02%   |


The financial statements reveal significant swings in profitability.  While Q1 2025 shows improved profit margin, the previous quarters show substantial losses. ROE is also inconsistent, reflecting the overall financial instability.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

ALB's performance significantly underperforms the S&P 500, highlighting substantial risk.  While periods of strong growth have occurred, the recent financial results are concerning, showing significant losses and volatile profitability. The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity. The high expected return needs further investigation and validation.  Before investing, a thorough understanding of the factors driving the recent negative earnings and the causes of the extreme price volatility is crucial.  Further analysis is needed to determine whether the recent price jump is sustainable and whether the current valuation is justified.  A long-term investment approach might be considered only after a more in-depth analysis addresses the underlying risks.
