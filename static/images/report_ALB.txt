**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive News:**
    *   UBS suggests a lithium deficit could boost ALB stock.
    *   Albemarle shares rallied 81% in 3 months.
    *   Lithium is becoming an AI play, benefiting Albemarle.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.42 (~Buy)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 23
*   **Target Price:** Average: 124.84, High: 200.00, Low: 75.00

*   **Analysis:**  The analyst consensus is "Buy," indicating a generally positive outlook. However, the average target price (124.84) is *below* the current market price (148.51), suggesting that analysts, on average, believe the stock is currently overvalued. The wide range between the high and low target prices (75-200) reflects significant uncertainty in future price movements.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -1.72  | 1.31 B$    |
| 2025-08-04 | -0.16  | 1.33 B$    |
| 2025-04-30 | 0      | 1.08 B$    |
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45  | 1.35 B$    |
| 2025-11-05 | -9.45  | 1.35 B$    |

*   **Analysis:**  The recent earnings reports are concerning. EPS (Earnings Per Share) has been negative for the last five quarters. While revenue has generally been around $1.3B, the inability to translate that into positive earnings is a significant red flag. The large negative EPS in 2024-11-06 and 2025-11-05 is particularly worrisome.

**6. Financial Information (Revenue, Profitability, Capital)**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $1.31B | 8.99%          |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.33B | 14.80%          |
| 2025-03-31 | $1.08B | 14.51%          |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.23B | 11.22%          |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.35B | -7.68%          |

**Capital and Profitability:**

|--------------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $10.00B | -1.61%    |
| 2025-06-30 | $10.24B | 0.22%     |

| 2024-12-31 | $9.96B  | 0.76%     |
| 2024-09-30 | $10.24B | -10.44%   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue:** Revenue has been relatively stable.
    *   **Profit Margin:** The profit margin has been inconsistent. Although there are positive profit margins, the negative profit margin in the quarter ending 2024-09-30 is concerning.
    *   **Equity:** Equity has remained relatively stable around $10 billion.
    *   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE has been weak, with negative values in two of the last five quarters, suggesting the company is not efficiently generating profits from shareholders' investments.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility, as reflected in the high MDD and fluctuating Alpha values.
*   **Recent Bullish Momentum:** Recent price action is bullish, with the price above key SMAs, a positive PPO, and positive recent relative divergence.  News sentiment is also largely positive.
*   **Earnings Concerns:**  Consistently negative EPS and fluctuating/sometimes negative profit margins and ROE are major concerns. This indicates underlying issues with profitability.
*   **Analyst Discrepancy:** While analysts have a "Buy" consensus, the average target price is below the current market price, suggesting potential overvaluation.
*   **Lithium Dependence:** Albemarle's performance is heavily tied to lithium prices and the overall demand for lithium in batteries, especially due to AI sector, making it susceptible to fluctuations in that market.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Despite recent bullish momentum and positive news, the consistently negative earnings and profitability concerns warrant caution. The analyst target price discrepancy further suggests potential overvaluation. While the short-term outlook may be positive, the long-term investment decision should be carefully evaluated.
