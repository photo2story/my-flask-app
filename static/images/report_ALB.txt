## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Analysis

**0. Executive Summary**

Albemarle Corp. is a specialty chemicals company with a focus on lithium, bromine, and catalysts.  Current analysis suggests a cautious approach due to recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500, mixed analyst sentiment, and negative earnings, although some see potential upside.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Accumulated Return:**
    *   ALB: -10.47%
    *   VOO: 97.05%
*   **Disparity:**
    *   Current: -107.5
    *   Relative Disparity: 4.2 (meaning ALB is currently near the bottom end of its historical underperformance range relative to VOO).

**Analysis:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The large negative accumulated return difference indicates substantial divergence.  The relative disparity suggests this underperformance is near its historical worst, potentially indicating an oversold condition or deeply rooted issues.

**Analysis:** The table reveals a volatile history for ALB. The CAGR is highly variable, with periods of significant growth and substantial decline. MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, indicating significant risk. Alpha is mostly positive in earlier periods but becomes strongly negative in recent years, showing underperformance compared to a risk-free asset. Beta fluctuates, indicating the stock's correlation with the market is inconsistent. The declining Cap(B) (presumably Market Cap) suggests a decrease in the company's valuation. The negative alpha and beta in recent years are concerning.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 92.74
*   **Previous Close:** 95.29
*   **Change:** -2.68
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 95.754
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 88.476
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 81.422

**Analysis:** The stock price is below its 5-day moving average but above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages. The recent price drop (change of -2.68) suggests negative momentum. The price moving averages suggest that ALB is in an upward trend in the short term, as the 5-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average, which is above the 60-day moving average.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5 (Low Investment)
*   **RSI:** 70.42 (Approaching Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.4562
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Disparity Change:** -0.1 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 699.7%

**Analysis:** The MRI of 0.5 suggests a generally low investment recommendation, indicating some risk. The RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback. The recent decline in relative disparity reinforces the short-term downward trend. The extremely high expected return (699.7%) is unusual and requires further scrutiny. It may be based on overly optimistic assumptions or a recovery from a severely undervalued state. The Hybrid Signal seems overly optimistic given the other indicators and may be based on a different dataset or model.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Several articles highlight the stock's decline ("Albemarle (ALB) Stock Sinks As Market Gains").
*   **Analyst Activity:** Mixed signals with Deutsche Bank adjusting the price target *up* to $95 (from $74) while RBC boosts their price target to $117 (from $80), keeping an "Outperform" rating.
*   **Lithium Market Focus:** Articles discuss the impact of geopolitical tensions and Trump Administration policies on lithium stocks.
*   **Valuation Concerns:** One article focuses on Albemarle's valuation in light of geopolitical factors.

**Analysis:** The news flow is mixed. While some analysts are raising price targets, the overall sentiment seems cautious due to market underperformance and external factors impacting the lithium market. The conflicting analyst opinions highlight the uncertainty surrounding the stock.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.72)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 92.24 / High: 200.00 / Low: 58.00

**Analysis:** The consensus "Hold" rating reflects the mixed signals. The wide range in target prices (58.00 to 200.00) indicates significant disagreement among analysts regarding the stock's future potential.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue    |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-08-04 | -0.16 | 1.33 B$    |
| 2025-04-30 | 0     | 1.08 B$    |
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45 | 1.35 B$    |
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96 | 1.43 B$    |
| 2025-08-04 | -1.96 | 1.43 B$    |

**Analysis:** The company has been reporting negative or near-zero EPS in recent quarters. While revenue has fluctuated, it hasn't translated into profitability. The large negative EPS in 2024-11-06 is a concern. The recurrence of the same EPS and revenue figures for 2024-07-31 and 2025-08-04 is likely a data entry error and should be verified.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $1.33B    | 14.80%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $1.08B    | 14.51%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $1.23B    | 11.22%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $1.35B    | -7.68%        |
| 2024-06-30   | $1.43B    | -0.74%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-06-30   | $10.24B   | 0.22%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $10.03B   | 0.41%     |
| 2024-12-31   | $9.96B    | 0.76%     |
| 2024-09-30   | $10.24B   | -10.44%    |
| 2024-06-30   | $11.22B   | -1.68%    |

**Analysis:** Recent quarters show improving profit margins, but there were losses in mid-2024. Equity has fluctuated, and ROE is generally low, with negative values earlier in the period. The low ROE suggests the company isn't generating strong returns on its equity. The profit margins for 2025 look high compared to the negative or near-zero EPS figures reported earlier. This suggests there might be accounting differences or one-time items affecting the numbers.

**7. Overall Assessment**

Albemarle presents a mixed picture.  The company's stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Recent earnings have been poor, with negative EPS. Analyst opinions are divided. While there are positive catalysts, the current financials suggest caution.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Lithium Market Dynamics:** The future of the lithium market is critical.  Geopolitical factors and government policies will significantly impact Albemarle's performance.
*   **Earnings Turnaround:**  The company needs to demonstrate a clear path to profitability.
*   **High Expected Return:** The high expected return seems unrealistic in light of the recent performance.  A more conservative estimate is warranted.
*   **Market Sentiment:**  The negative news flow and consensus "Hold" rating suggest market skepticism.

**Recommendation:**

A cautious approach is warranted. Given the recent underperformance, negative earnings, and mixed analyst sentiment, it would be best to wait for signs of a turnaround before considering a significant investment. Further research into the lithium market and Albemarle's specific strategies is essential.
