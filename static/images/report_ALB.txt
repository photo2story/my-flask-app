2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Albemarle Corp. (ALB) based on the provided data.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (ALB vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Company Overview:** Albemarle Corp. is a specialty chemicals manufacturing company with a focus on lithium, bromine specialties, and catalysts.
*   **Cumulative Return:**
    *   ALB: 26.52%
    *   VOO (S&P 500): 91.40%
*   **Divergence:** -78.6 (Relative Divergence: 17.9)
*   **Analysis:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative divergence indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns, with ALB lagging considerably.

*   **Cap(B):** Market cap in billions of dollars, which shows fluctuations over the years.
*   **Overall:** The Alpha/Beta analysis paints a concerning picture, particularly in recent periods. High volatility (Beta), large potential losses (MDD), and underperformance relative to risk (negative Alpha) are significant red flags.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The analyst consensus is "Buy," but the average target price (124.84) is below the current price (141.44). This suggests analysts, on average, believe the stock is currently overvalued. The wide range in target prices (75 to 200) suggests significant uncertainty among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜         | EPS    | 매출         |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -1.72  | 1.31 B$     |
| 2025-08-04 | -0.16  | 1.33 B$     |
| 2025-04-30 | 0      | 1.08 B$     |
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45  | 1.35 B$     |
| 2025-11-05 | -9.45  | 1.35 B$     |

*   **Analysis:** The EPS figures are concerning. Albemarle has reported negative EPS in all recent quarters, some substantially so (-9.45). While revenue has generally been above $1 billion, it hasn't translated into profitability. The recent -1.72 EPS, while better than -9.45, still shows that the company is operating at a loss. This clearly is negatively impactful.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has fluctuated but generally remains above $1 billion. Profit margins have been inconsistent, with a negative margin in 2024-09-30. The recent margins are positive but not extremely high, particularly when compared to the volatility of the stock.
    *   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has remained relatively stable around $10 billion. ROE (Return on Equity) has been volatile, with negative values in the most recent and distant quarter. The generally low and sometimes negative ROE, coupled with the revenue numbers, indicates that Albemarle is not efficiently generating profits from its equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** High beta and maximum drawdown indicate substantial volatility and potential risk.
*   **Negative Alpha:** Negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to its risk profile.
*   **Downtrend:** Recent price action and PPO indicate a downtrend.
*   **Mixed Signals:** News is mixed, with positive mentions of future lithium demand but also negative headlines and analyst downgrades.
*   **Negative Earnings:** Recent earnings are negative, raising concerns about profitability.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analysts have a "Buy" consensus, but the average target price is below the current price, indicating potential overvaluation.
*   **Financials:** Revenue is strong, but profitability is inconsistent, and ROE is low and sometimes negative.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, an investment in ALB appears risky. The underperformance compared to the S&P 500, high volatility, negative earnings, and mixed news are significant concerns. While the analyst consensus is "Buy," the average target price suggests potential overvaluation. A medium investment recommendation due to the MRI is in contrast to other indicators that lean towards a higher risk level. Further in-depth analysis of the lithium market, Albemarle's competitive position, and cost structure is necessary before considering an investment. The high degree of divergence from the S\&P 500 suggests that this stock requires high risk tolerance and a strong conviction in the lithium market rebound.
