## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Investment Review

This report analyzes Albemarle Corp (ALB), a leading producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Albemarle's cumulative return (10.01%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.91%) over the period analyzed.  The difference is a substantial -110.9 percentage points. The relative divergence of -110.9 places ALB at the 2.9th percentile of its historical range against VOO. This indicates significant underperformance compared to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $99.37
* **5-day Moving Average:** $104.03
* **20-day Moving Average:** $106.13
* **60-day Moving Average:** $100.29

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (38.43):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so.
* **PPO (-1.06):** Suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-1.4):** Shows a recent decline in relative performance against the market.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided data suggests no expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) at this time. This should be considered in light of the company's significant underperformance.  The lack of a positive expected return might warrant additional investigation given the long term timeframe.

Given the closing price of $99.39 is close to the 60 day moving average, there's no evidence of a recent sharp price movement (either a rapid increase or a rapid decrease).  The current price is near the lower end of the recent price range.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data reveals a concerning trend:

* **Quarterly Revenue:** Revenue shows significant volatility, with a sharp drop from $2.31B in Q3 2023 to $1.35B in Q3 2024.
* **EPS:** EPS has swung drastically between significant profits ($2.58) and substantial losses (-$9.45) in consecutive quarters.  This highlights an inconsistent performance and potential business vulnerability.
* **Profitability:** Profit margins fluctuated wildly, shifting from positive in Q1 2024 to significantly negative in several subsequent quarters.  This volatility underscores the need for deeper analysis into underlying business conditions and market dynamics.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  The provided financial data mirrors the conclusions of the earnings analysis. Revenue is inconsistent, and profit margins are volatile and largely negative in recent quarters, signaling a problematic trend.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity levels have also seen fluctuations, and Return on Equity (ROE) has shifted from positive to significantly negative in recent quarters, further supporting the concerns about profitability and overall financial health.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  The provided data does not include recent earnings news (within the last 2 days), market outlook, or analyst opinions.  This critical information gap hinders a complete analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle (ALB) is currently exhibiting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, coupled with volatile and largely negative recent earnings and financial data. The stock price shows a bearish trend, supported by technical indicators.  The lack of recent news and a more in-depth market analysis prevents a more conclusive assessment, but the current picture is negative.  A significant improvement in profitability, revenue consistency, and overall market sentiment is needed before considering a long-term investment in ALB. The provided expected return of 0% reflects this current negative outlook.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent financial performance downturn is warranted before any investment decision.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the presented information, a cautious approach is recommended.  Further due diligence is crucial, including:

* **Analyzing the specific reasons behind the significant drops in revenue and EPS.** Market forces, internal issues, and strategic decisions require examination.
