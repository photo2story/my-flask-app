The high RSI suggests the stock is overbought, potentially indicating a near-term pullback.

ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and its recent earnings report highlights challenges within the lithium market. The stock is currently overbought according to the RSI, while other technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downtrend.

While ALB operates in a growing industry with significant long-term potential, its recent performance and market challenges suggest a cautious approach. Investors should consider monitoring the stock closely, especially during periods of volatility.  The overbought condition and potential near-term correction warrant further evaluation before taking any significant positions.
