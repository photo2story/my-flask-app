**6. Overall Analysis:**

ALB is currently experiencing a severe downturn.  The substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative earnings, shrinking revenue, and declining profitability paint a grim picture. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions,  the negative momentum (PPO) and strong downtrend outweigh this indicator.  The extremely high projected long-term return is highly suspect and should not be relied upon.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the drastic drop in earnings and to assess the long-term viability of the company.  Caution is advised before any investment in ALB at this time.  A deeper dive into the company's specific challenges and future outlook is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The potential data entry error also needs to be resolved.
