This report provides an analysis of **ALB (Albemarle Corporation)**, a global leader in the production and marketing of lithium and bromine, as well as a variety of other specialty chemicals. 

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed, with a cumulative return of -0.53% compared to VOO's 89.66%. This translates to a divergence of -90.19%, placing it within the bottom 3.66% of historical divergence values.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.25
* **5-day Moving Average:** $89.56
* **20-day Moving Average:** $83.55
* **60-day Moving Average:** $93.23

The current price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term bullish momentum. However, it sits below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 70.77
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.85
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.96 (short-term decline)
* **Expected Return:** 229.66% (maximum 5-year expected return on current investment)

The high RSI value indicates that the stock is currently overbought, suggesting potential for a correction. The positive PPO value suggests bullish momentum, but the negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence implies a recent decline in relative performance. The Expected Return indicates a potentially high future growth, although it is important to remember that this is based on assumptions and may not materialize.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue |
|------------|-------|---------|
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96 | 1.43 B$ |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.08 | 1.36 B$ |
| 2023-11-01 | 2.58  | 2.31 B$ |
| 2023-08-02 | 5.54  | 2.37 B$ |
| 2024-07-31 | 5.54  | 2.37 B$ |

The most recent earnings report for Q2 2024 showed a significant decline in EPS, falling below analyst expectations. This suggests challenges within the company's current operations and may contribute to the observed underperformance. Further analysis of the earnings report and company guidance is necessary to assess future prospects.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

ALB is currently facing challenges in its stock performance and recent earnings, with its stock price significantly lagging behind the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest both short-term bullish momentum and potential for a correction. While the Expected Return is high, it is based on assumptions and may not reflect the actual outcome. 

Overall, the company's future performance is uncertain, and further analysis of its financials, industry trends, and competitor landscape is necessary for a comprehensive investment decision.
