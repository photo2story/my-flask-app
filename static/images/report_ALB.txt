* **Closing Price:** $55.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $53.78
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $61.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $72.48

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase of $1.59 (from the previous close) indicates a short-term upward movement, but the overall trend seems bearish given the position relative to the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)

* **PPO:** -0.42 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.1 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** 14505.8% (This exceptionally high figure needs further clarification on its calculation methodology and assumptions to be meaningfully interpreted.)  A 14505.8% expected return over a long period (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 needs further validation and is highly improbable without additional context.  This requires significant scrutiny.
