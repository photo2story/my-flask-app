**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -1.72 | 1.31 B$     |
| 2025-08-04 | -0.16 | 1.33 B$     |

| 2025-11-05 | -9.45 | 1.35 B$     |

*   **Analysis:**  The recent EPS figures are concerning. The company has reported negative EPS in recent quarters. The last earnings report (2025-11-05) had a severely negative EPS, though revenue was decent. The earlier duplicate earning is suspect, however we should not ignore the earning with eps of -9.45.

    *   **ROE:** The recent negative ROE values reflect poor profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Albemarle (ALB) is facing several challenges:

*   **Underperformance:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the expected return is zero.
*   **Volatility:** High MDD and Beta indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Earnings & Profitability:** Recent negative EPS and ROE, along with fluctuating revenue and profit margins, are concerning.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analyst consensus is a "Buy," but the average target price is below the current price.
*   **News & Events:** While there is some positive news regarding long-term lithium demand, there are also negative headlines about operational disruptions and rating downgrades.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, **caution** is warranted. While the Hybrid Signal suggests a strong buy, the other indicators are conflicting and are not very optimistic. The zero expected return, negative recent earnings, and negative ROE are major red flags. The analyst consensus "Buy" is undermined by the average target price being below the current market price and significant uncertainty among analysts. Close monitoring of the lithium market, the company's financial performance, and any further news events is essential before making an investment decision. Waiting for more concrete signs of a turnaround is advisable.
