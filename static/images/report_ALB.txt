**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜        | EPS   | 매출      |
|-------------|-------|-----------|

    *   Analyst target price, on average, is lower than the current stock price
*   **Positives:**
    *   Recent positive price momentum, supported by moving averages.
    *   Positive news sentiment driven by potential lithium demand and analyst upgrades.
    *   Medium investment recommendation from MRI.
    *   High expected return (although this should be viewed cautiously given the company's recent performance).
    *   Analyst consensus leans toward "Buy."

**Conclusion:**

While ALB has experienced a recent price rally and benefits from positive industry trends (lithium demand), its financial performance (negative EPS, fluctuating profit margins, negative ROE) and historical underperformance are major concerns. The high expected return should be tempered with the reality of the company's financial struggles. Investors should proceed with caution and conduct further due diligence to understand the underlying causes of the company's financial difficulties and the sustainability of the recent positive momentum.
