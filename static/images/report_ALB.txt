*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis Table:**

    | Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|---------|-------|--------|------|--------|

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis Interpretation:**

    *   **Beta:** The Beta is consistently above 1, rising to 1.8 recently, indicating that ALB's price is more volatile than the market.  It tends to amplify market movements, both positive and negative. In recent years (2021-2025), the beta has increased, meaning ALB became more sensitive.
    *   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are mostly negative, especially in recent periods. This suggests that ALB has consistently underperformed its expected return based on its Beta and the market's performance.  In short, it's underperforming *even considering* its higher volatility.
    *   **CAGR & MDD:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows strong growth in 2018-2022, but significant negative growth in recent periods. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is also very high in the recent periods, indicating substantial risk.
    *   **Cap(B):** The Market Capitalization has fluctuated, but has shrunk a lot in the latest periods.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

    *   Lithium Deficit Could Boost Albemarle Stock (UBS)
    *   Albemarle Stock Jumps to a Fresh High as Lithium Prices Spike
    *   Strong Lithium Production Outlook
    *   How To Earn $500 A Month From Albemarle Stock
*   **Negative Sentiment:**
    *   WA Fires Trigger Evacuation Near Lithium Refinery
*   **Neutral:**
    *   Albemarle Corporation $ALB Stock Holdings Lifted by Cwm LLC

*   **Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. There are positive drivers related to lithium prices and production. However, the WA fires represent a real operational risk, and investors should monitor these developments carefully.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:**  Not Provided
*   **Target Price:** The average target price is $124.84, which is **below** the current price of $143.93. This suggests analysts, on average, believe the stock is currently overvalued. The wide range of target prices ($75.00 - $200.00) indicates a lack of strong consensus.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜        | EPS   | 매출        |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-11-05  | -1.72 | 1.31 B$     |
| 2025-08-04  | -0.16 | 1.33 B$     |
| 2025-04-30  | 0     | 1.08 B$     |
| 2024-11-06  | -9.45 | 1.35 B$     |
| 2025-11-05  | -9.45 | 1.35 B$     |

*   **Analysis:**

    *   The recent EPS (Earnings Per Share) figures are negative, especially -9.45. While revenue has been relatively stable, profitability is clearly a concern. The revenue decrease down to 1.08B$ is a sign that the business is doing poorly. The fact that 2024-11-06 and 2025-11-05 have the same entries seems wrong.

*   **Sentiment:** News sentiment is mixed. Positive news focuses on lithium demand and production, but negative news regarding operational risks (WA fires) exists.
*   **Technicals:**  The stock is trading above its 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The RSI is approaching overbought territory.
*   **Analyst Outlook:** Analysts have mixed views, and their average target price is **below** the current price, suggesting potential overvaluation.
*   **Risk:**  The MRI is at 0.8, indicating medium risk, but the high Beta, MDD, and negative Alpha suggest a higher-than-average risk profile.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is "Safe" with a 90% purchase strategy.
*   **Expected return:** The expected return from this point is high, and may be unrealistic.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Albemarle Corp faces significant challenges despite the positive long-term outlook for lithium. The company is underperforming the market, exhibiting high volatility, and struggling with profitability. The analyst target price being below the current price, combined with a high beta and recent negative financial performance, suggests that caution is warranted. While positive developments in the lithium market could provide upside, investors should carefully weigh the risks before investing in ALB. It's crucial to monitor the operational situation (WA fires) and the company's progress in improving its profitability. The expected return is a bit optimistic given the context of the other data.
