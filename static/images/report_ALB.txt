**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.  The company's recent performance shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **ALB Cumulative Return:** -10.92%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 104.98%
* **Return Difference:** -115.9% (This indicates ALB significantly underperformed VOO.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 5.0% (This means ALB's underperformance sits at the 5th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500.)


The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility in ALB's performance over the years.  While some periods show exceptionally high growth (e.g., 2019-2021), others exhibit substantial losses (e.g., 2022-2025).  The Alpha and Beta values also fluctuate, suggesting a non-consistent relationship with the market (Beta representing market sensitivity and Alpha representing excess return over the market).  Note that the negative CAGRs for 2022-2025 are unusually high and should be investigated further.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $78.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $75.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $82.27

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downward trend. However, it's above its 20-day moving average, suggesting some short-term support. The price is significantly below its 60-day moving average, indicating a more pronounced longer-term downtrend. The recent price change of $0.69 (from $77.03 to $77.56) indicates a modest upward movement.  It's not a significant 'jump' but a small positive change.

* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1107.8% (This extraordinarily high figure needs further investigation and context.  It's likely an error or based on unrealistic assumptions.)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45  | $1.35 B      |
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96  | $1.43 B      |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.08  | $1.36 B      |
| 2023-11-01 | 2.58   | $2.31 B      |
| 2024-11-06 | 2.58   | $2.31 B      | *(Duplicate entry â€“ potential data error)*

The recent earnings data shows significant volatility and a concerning trend of negative EPS in the last three quarters (July, May, and November 2024), indicating substantial losses.  The duplicated entry for November 6, 2024 needs clarification. This negative trend requires further investigation into underlying factors.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.23B | 11.22%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.35B | -7.68%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.43B | -0.74%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.36B | 2.86%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.36B | -29.88%      |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.96B | 0.76% |
| 2024-09-30 | $10.24B | -10.44% |
| 2024-06-30 | $11.22B | -1.68% |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.53B | 0.02% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.41B | -6.56% |

Both revenue and profitability show significant fluctuations.  Negative profit margins in several quarters are a major concern.  The ROE (Return on Equity) also reflects significant volatility and negative values in several quarters, indicating poor returns on shareholder investment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, showing substantial volatility in both returns and financial performance. Recent earnings reports reveal alarming negative EPS and fluctuating profit margins. The very high projected long-term return (1107.8%) is highly suspect and requires further investigation.  The technical indicators suggest a potential short-term upward trend, but the overall picture paints a cautious outlook.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent negative earnings and the unusually high expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data strongly suggests that ALB is currently facing serious headwinds.
