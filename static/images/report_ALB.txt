Albemarle Corporation is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.  Comparing ALB's cumulative return (-0.88%) to the S&P 500's (VOO) return (120.68%) shows a significant underperformance of -121.56 percentage points as of the last data point.  The provided data indicates ALB's performance has lagged substantially behind the broader market.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided CAGR figures show significant volatility in ALB's performance over the years, ranging from substantial gains to significant losses.

* **Expected Return (7821.6%):** This exceptionally high figure needs further clarification.  It's crucial to understand the calculation methodology and assumptions behind this projection before considering its validity.

This indicates a dramatic shift in the company's financial performance in the final months of the year. Revenue also shows significant variability, with a significant drop in recent quarters.
