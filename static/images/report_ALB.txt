## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

ALB's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While specific timeframes aren't provided for the cumulative return calculation, the current relative divergence suggests ALB is substantially lagging the market.  Recent price action shows ALB trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  Furthermore, low RSI and negative PPO values suggest oversold conditions.  Earnings have been volatile, with recent quarters showing significant losses, contrasting with stronger previous periods.  Financial information shows fluctuating profitability and return on equity.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a specialty chemicals company focused on lithium.

* **Cumulative Return:** ALB: 1.61%, VOO: 55.98%
* **Return Difference:** ALB significantly underperformed VOO by approximately 54.37 percentage points.  This large gap highlights substantial underperformance. The provided relative divergence (currently -56.0, indicating -56% from the maximum historical difference between ALB and VOO performance) further underscores this underperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals highly volatile performance.  Positive Alphas in several periods indicate outperformance relative to the market benchmark during those specific years, but the significant negative CAGR in recent periods (-53%, -204%, -348%) demonstrates considerable risk and substantial losses.  The high Beta values show strong sensitivity to market movements.  Overall, this data indicates high risk and volatility, which despite periods of outperformance, have recently resulted in extreme underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $52.73
* **5-Day MA:** $64.36
* **20-Day MA:** $72.78
* **60-Day MA:** $79.07

The closing price is significantly below all three moving averages, strongly suggesting a downtrend. The recent price drop (-9.25) reflects significant negative momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk) – indicating substantial market risk.
* **RSI:** 6.92 (Extremely oversold) – suggesting potential for a bounce, but also indicating a very weak market condition.
* **PPO:** -2.87 (Negative and below -2, indicating strong bearish momentum) – reinforces the downtrend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.3 (Short-term upward movement) – implies a minor short-term positive shift, but insignificant considering the overall bearish trend.
* **Expected Return:** 5621.0% – This exceptionally high figure requires further clarification.  It's likely an extrapolation based on past performance, ignoring present risk and the extreme recent downtrend. This should be treated with extreme caution. The claim of significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over two years or more should be viewed as highly speculative given the current market position and recent performance. The large drop in price (change of -9.25) suggests a potential market event impacting the share price.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45  | $1.35 B      |
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96  | $1.43 B      |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.08  | $1.36 B      |
| 2023-11-01 | 2.58   | $2.31 B      |
| 2024-11-06 | 2.58   | $2.31 B      | *(Possible Data Entry Error: Duplicate Entry)*


The most recent earnings show substantial losses, a significant deterioration from previous quarters.  The large negative EPS figures signal serious financial concerns.  There appears to be a duplicate entry for November 6th, 2024, which needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.23B | 11.22%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.35B | -7.68%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.43B | -0.74%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.36B | 2.86%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.36B | -29.88%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE    |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.96B | 0.76%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $10.24B | -10.44% |
| 2024-06-30 | $11.22B | -1.68% |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.53B | 0.02%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.41B  | -6.56% |

Profitability is highly inconsistent, swinging between significant losses and modest gains.  Return on Equity (ROE) also demonstrates considerable volatility.  The recent improvement in profitability (2024-12-31) needs further investigation to ascertain if it represents a sustainable trend reversal.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ALB is currently experiencing a significant downturn.  The stock is severely underperforming the S&P 500, showing considerable volatility and high risk. Negative earnings, low technical indicators, and a significantly bearish price trend paint a concerning picture.  While the long-term expected return is extremely high, it appears unrealistic given current market conditions and recent financial performance.  The claim needs validation with a robust model considering the current negative trends.  Further investigation is required to determine the reasons behind the recent substantial losses and the sustainability of any potential recovery.  Caution is strongly advised before investing in ALB at this time.  The data suggests that the significant negative price movement has yet to fully play out, and further losses are a substantial possibility.
