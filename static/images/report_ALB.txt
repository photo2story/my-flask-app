**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜        | EPS    | 매출       |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -1.72  | 1.31 B$    |
| 2025-08-04 | -0.16  | 1.33 B$    |
| 2025-04-30 | 0      | 1.08 B$    |

| 2025-11-05 | -9.45  | 1.35 B$    |

**Analysis:**

Recent EPS (Earnings Per Share) figures are negative. While revenue has been relatively stable, the lack of profitability is concerning. The negative EPS suggests problems with cost management, lower margins, or other factors affecting the bottom line. The discrepancy of the earnings date (2024-11-06 and 2025-11-05) may indicate duplication.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue is fluctuating but generally stable around $1.3 billion.

*   **Equity:** Equity is relatively stable around $10 billion.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** The ROE is also highly variable, mirroring the profit margin trends. The recent negative ROE is a red flag.

Albemarle Corp (ALB) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Underperformance:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility and risk, as demonstrated by its high MDD.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Recent news includes both positive earnings reactions and institutional selling.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analysts have a neutral "Hold" consensus, and the target price range is wide.
*   **Profitability Concerns:** Recent earnings and financial data reveal negative EPS, fluctuating revenue, and negative ROE, raising concerns about profitability.
*   **Short-Term Momentum:** While recent price action suggests short-term upward momentum, the approaching overbought RSI indicates a potential pullback.
*   **High Expected Return:** A very high expected return may be overly optimistic and should be viewed with caution.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, investing in Albemarle Corp at this time appears risky. While there's short-term upward momentum, the underlying financial performance and analyst sentiment are cause for concern. The company needs to demonstrate sustained profitability and address its underperformance relative to the broader market before it can be considered a strong investment opportunity.
