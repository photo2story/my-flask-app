| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE      |

**Analysis:**

Equity has remained relatively stable around $10 billion. The ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated, with recent quarters showing near-zero or slightly negative returns. The negative ROE in 2024-09-30 is a significant concern, indicating poor profitability relative to equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) presents a mixed investment picture.

*   **Underperformance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period and recent years' alpha/beta analyses are not encouraging.
*   **Recent Positive Momentum:** The stock exhibits short-term upward momentum, as indicated by the SMAs, RSI, and recent divergence change.
*   **Positive News Catalysts:** Recent news highlights potential positive catalysts, including lithium deficits, institutional buying, and analyst upgrades.
*   **High Volatility:**  The high MDD values indicate that investors should be prepared for significant price swings.
*   **Mixed Financial Performance:** Revenue has been relatively stable, but EPS and ROE have been inconsistent, with recent negative values.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:**  Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating, but the wide range in target prices suggests uncertainty. The average target price is *below* the current price.
*   **Overbought Condition:** The high RSI suggests that the stock may be overbought in the short term.
*   **Model Recommendation Caution:** The high MRI suggests a model recommendation; however, the volatile market of lithium makes relying on the model alone risky.

**Overall:**

While there are positive catalysts and short-term upward momentum, Albemarle's recent underperformance, negative earnings, and high volatility warrant caution. The stock may be overbought in the short term. Furthermore, the analyst target prices suggest limited upside potential. The high expected return (58.4%) should be viewed cautiously, given the inconsistent financial performance and recent struggles. The company needs to demonstrate consistent profitability and improve its ROE to justify a strong bullish outlook.
