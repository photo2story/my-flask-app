*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Note the wide swings in CAGR, from positive triple-digit gains to steep losses.  Recent years (2022-2025) have been particularly poor.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The high MDD figures (ranging from 68% to 81.9%) indicate significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the investment's performance relative to the market (S&P 500). The negative Alpha values for recent periods (especially 2022-2025) indicate significant underperformance compared to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta around 0-0.2 suggests the stock has been less volatile than the overall market, but this is less relevant given the strong negative alpha in recent years, and beta has significantly increased recently (0.5 and 0.3).  The very negative beta (-0.9) in the most recent period is notable.

## 3. Indicators Analysis

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 62.26 (Approaching overbought territory, but not there yet)
*   **PPO:** -0.16 (Indicates the price is slightly below its moving average, but close)
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (7 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)" - Suggests a strong buy signal based on the algorithm.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.0 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 85.7% (over 2 years compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**  The MRI suggests a medium level of risk, and the hybrid signal indicates a buying opportunity.  The rising RSI indicates increasing buying pressure. The positive change in relative divergence further supports a short-term upward trend. The high expected return (compared to the S&P 500) is optimistic but should be viewed cautiously in light of ALB's historical volatility and recent underperformance. The large price change reflects the recent news.

## 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Positive Headlines:** Several headlines indicate positive sentiment, including rising lithium prices, analyst target increases (to $150), and institutional buying.
*   **Neutral Headlines:** Some headlines are more neutral, simply reporting price changes or analyst ratings.

**Analysis:**  The news flow appears to be mostly positive, focusing on factors that could boost ALB's stock price. The analyst target increases and institutional buying provide further validation. It is important to check the lithium price forecast and do your own analysis, not just depend on news.

## 6. Financial Information

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |

| 2025-09-30 | $1.31B  | 8.99%         |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.33B  | 14.80%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $1.08B  | 14.51%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.23B  | 11.22%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.35B  | -7.68%        |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE      |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $10.00B   | -1.61%   |
| 2025-06-30 | $10.24B   | 0.22%    |

| 2024-09-30 | $10.24B   | -10.44%  |

**Analysis:**  While revenue has been generally consistent, profitability (Profit Margin and ROE) has been highly volatile. The negative ROE in recent quarters is concerning and aligns with the negative EPS figures. The drastic profit margin change from -7.68% to 11.22% requires more in-depth analysis.

## 7. Comprehensive Analysis

**Summary:**

*   **Underperformance:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and historical data shows a trend of high volatility and periods of substantial underperformance (negative Alpha).
*   **Recent Uptrend:** The stock is currently in a short-term uptrend, supported by moving average analysis and a recent increase in price, and the hybrid signal indicator.
*   **Positive News:** Recent news flow is largely positive, driven by rising lithium prices and analyst target increases.
*   **Analyst Discrepancy:** While the analyst consensus is "Buy," the average target price is below the current price, suggesting potential overvaluation.
*   **Earnings Concerns:** Recent earnings reports show negative EPS and volatile profitability, which are significant warning signs.
*   **Volatile Financials:** The financial data reveals inconsistent profit margins and ROE, reflecting underlying business challenges.
*   **Lithium Price:** The performance of the stock is linked to lithium prices so it is important to forecast the lithium prices for a concrete decision.

**Overall Recommendation:**

While the recent positive price movement and bullish news might be tempting, the underlying financial performance and historical volatility warrant caution. **A long-term investment in ALB at the current price is risky.**

**Before investing, further research is needed to:**

*   **Investigate the reasons for the recent negative EPS and volatile profitability.**
*   **Analyze the long-term outlook for lithium prices and demand.**
*   **Understand the company's strategy for addressing its financial challenges.**
*   **Factor in personal risk tolerance given the high MDD and Beta (in some periods).**

A short-term trade based on the current uptrend might be considered, but with strict risk management.
