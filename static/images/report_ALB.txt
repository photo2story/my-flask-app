## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine, serving the energy storage, specialty chemicals, and other industries.

The cumulative return of ALB from the unspecified start date to the end date is 10.01%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 120.91% over the same period.  The difference is a -110.9% underperformance.  The relative underperformance, considering historical volatility, places ALB at the 2.9th percentile relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantially lower return than the benchmark index.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $99.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $104.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $106.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $100.29

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (38.43):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (-1.06):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-1.4):** Shows a recent downward trend in relative strength.

The current price of $99.38 is below the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, reflecting a recent decline.  A significant rebound isn't indicated by these indicators. The expected return of 0.0% over the long-term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 suggests that even with a long-term investment, outperformance is unlikely unless significant changes occur within the company or market conditions change substantially.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The most recent quarterly results show a sharp decline in revenue and profitability compared to previous quarters:

* **Revenue Trend:**  Revenue declined significantly from $2.31B in Q3 2023 to $1.35B in Q3 2024.
* **EPS Trend:** EPS plummeted from $2.58 in Q3 2023 to -$9.45 in Q3 2024, indicating significant losses.  This represents a substantial drop in profitability.
* **Significant Changes:** The dramatic shift from profitability to significant losses in the last two quarters is a major concern. There is no information provided on expectations, so a comparison to them is not possible.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial information reveals a deteriorating financial position for Albemarle:

* **Revenue & Profitability:**  Profit margins have swung dramatically from positive to heavily negative within a short period. This suggests significant challenges in managing costs or pricing.
* **Capital & Profitability:** A declining equity value accompanied by a heavily negative ROE paints a picture of decreasing profitability and shareholder value.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle is currently experiencing significant financial difficulties.  The sharp decline in revenue, the substantial move from profitability to significant losses as evidenced by EPS, and the negative trends in key financial metrics like profit margins and ROE point to substantial challenges.  The stock's underperformance compared to the S&P 500, coupled with negative technical indicators, suggests a bearish outlook.  The lack of information regarding expectations prevents full analysis of whether the recent performance exceeded or failed to meet analysts' forecasts.  Further research is needed to assess the long-term viability of Albemarle given the severe downturn in recent earnings. Any investment decision should consider these substantial risks.
