**6. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is currently experiencing a period of significant underperformance compared to the broader market (S&P 500).  The negative EPS figures, declining profit margins, and negative ROE indicate significant financial headwinds.  While the RSI suggests the stock isn't extremely oversold, the negative PPO and downward price trend paint a bearish picture in the short term.  The projected long-term expected return of 7167% is highly improbable and needs serious scrutiny regarding its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions. Before any investment decision, thorough investigation of the reasons behind the company's recent financial struggles and clarification on the contradictory data points are necessary. The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entries) further emphasize the need for careful analysis and validation of the provided information.
