**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a global leader in the production and sale of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.  Over the analyzed period, ALB significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a -74.7% difference in cumulative returns.  This substantial underperformance is further highlighted by the provided alpha and beta values.  While alpha values fluctuate between 0.1 and 2.1 indicating periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market,  the consistently high beta values (ranging from 8.4 to 16.6, except for 2017-2019 and 2022-2024) reveal ALB's significant volatility and high sensitivity to market movements. The extremely high negative CAGR values in the last three periods (2018-2020, 2022-2024, and 2023-2025) strongly indicate a period of substantial loss.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 103.0%   | 7.7%    | 0.1   | 13.7  |        |
| 2016-2018  | 15.0%    | 58.1%   | -6.0% | 0.1   |        |
| 2017-2019  | -43.0%   | 58.1%   | -77.0%| 0.6   |        |
| 2018-2020  | 108.0%   | 62.9%   | 78.0% | 0.9   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 282.0%   | 62.9%   | 221.0%| 1.0   |        |
| 2020-2022  | 251.0%   | 75.6%   | 242.0%| 1.0   |        |
| 2021-2023  | -53.0%   | 77.6%   | -73.0%| 0.7   |        |
| 2022-2024  | -211.0%  | 77.6%   | -232.0%| 0.8   |        |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

ALB's current price is below both its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average reinforces this bearish sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI (40.60) is nearing oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term buying opportunity. However, the PPO (0.29) suggests a weaker bullish momentum. The negative recent relative divergence (-0.5) points towards a recent short-term decline. The MRI of 0.41 suggests medium risk.  The extraordinarily high expected return of 14488.4%  seems unrealistic and likely reflects an error in the provided data.  Further investigation into the calculation methodology is needed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data show fluctuating revenue but consistently negative EPS figures except for the last quarter (2025-04-30). The substantial losses need to be investigated further, possibly due to factors such as raw material costs, market demand changes, or competition.


| Date        | EPS     | Revenue    |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| 2025-04-30  | 0       | 1.08 B$     |
| 2024-11-06  | -9.45   | 1.35 B$     |
| 2024-07-31  | -1.96   | 1.43 B$     |
| 2024-05-01  | -0.08   | 1.36 B$     |
| 2025-04-30  | -0.08   | 1.36 B$     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing data is a significant limitation for a thorough evaluation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ALB's substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500, high beta, recent negative earnings, and missing key financial data paint a concerning picture. While the RSI suggests potential short-term buying opportunities, the negative trend indicated by moving averages, negative EPS, and the high risk associated with high beta needs careful consideration. The extremely high projected return is likely erroneous and should be disregarded.  Further investigation into the underlying causes of the negative EPS and missing financial data are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data provided indicates high risk and the extremely high reported potential return should be critically scrutinized.
