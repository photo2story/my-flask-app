**7. Overall Assessment**

Albemarle (ALB) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negatives:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, recent negative EPS and volatile profitability, analyst "Hold" consensus, and concerns about the long-term outlook (negative CAGR and Alpha in recent years).
*   **Positives:** Recent upward price movement, high MRI score, positive PPO, and potential for long-term outperformance (though the high "Expected Return" should be viewed cautiously). Recent news suggests increased investor interest in the lithium sector.

**Conclusion:**

While the MRI suggests a relatively safe investment and the technical indicators show some positive short-term momentum, the historical underperformance, negative earnings, and analyst sentiment warrant caution. The potential for future growth in the lithium sector is a factor to consider, but further due diligence is recommended before making an investment decision. The very high expected return should be treated with significant skepticism until the company demonstrates a sustained turnaround in financial performance.
