**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB), a leading producer of lithium and other specialty chemicals, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for ALB is -4.74%, while the S&P 500 shows a cumulative return of 121.09%.  This represents a substantial divergence of -125.8 percentage points.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $85.65
* **5-day Moving Average:** $87.07
* **20-day Moving Average:** $89.69
* **60-day Moving Average:** $97.20

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price change of -$0.73 reflects a slight downward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.69 (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, indicating bearish momentum but not oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.35 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-)  (Short-term downward trend)

The significant negative price change (-$0.73) from the previous close suggests a downward trend, but is not a rapid decline. The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of 7197.2% against the S&P 500 seems exceptionally high and likely unrealistic.  Further investigation is needed to understand the basis for this projection. It's crucial to treat this number with significant skepticism.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There are substantial losses in Q3 and Q2 of 2024, contrasting with profitability in Q1 2024 and previous quarters.  The significant negative EPS in the last two quarters (-$9.45 and -$1.96) warrants a closer look at the underlying causes impacting profitability.  The discrepancy between the two entries for 2024-11-06 needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial statements reveal inconsistent profitability. While Q1 2024 showed a positive profit margin, subsequent quarters have shown significant losses. ROE also fluctuates between positive and negative values, reflecting the volatile profitability.  The substantial drop in equity from Q1 2024 to Q4 2023 is also noteworthy and requires further investigation.


| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity   | ROE      |
|------------|---------|---------------|----------|----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.35B  | -7.68%        | $10.24B  | -10.44%  |

| 2023-12-31 | $2.36B  | -29.88%       | $9.41B   | -6.56%   |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.31B  | 2.38%         | $9.90B   | 3.06%    |


**7. Overall Summary:**

ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting a substantial negative divergence. Recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The company's recent earnings reports show considerable volatility and significant losses in the last two quarters.  Financial statements reveal inconsistent profitability and fluctuations in equity. The projected long-term expected return is unrealistic and needs further justification.  A thorough investigation into the causes of the recent losses and the basis for the high expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Investors should exercise caution given the current performance and financial instability.
