**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |
|------------|-------|------------|

*   **Analysis:** The recent earnings data shows inconsistent profitability. While revenue has been relatively stable, the Earnings Per Share (EPS) has been fluctuating. The negative EPS values in several quarters raise concerns about the company's profitability. The -9.45 EPS reported in 2024-11-06 and 2025-11-05 is particularly alarming, followed by increases into the end of 2025.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $1.31B    | 8.99%         |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.33B    | 14.80%        |

| 2024-09-30 | $1.35B    | -7.68%        |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has been relatively consistent around $1.3 billion, but the profit margin has fluctuated significantly. The negative profit margin in Q3 2024 is a red flag, while more recent quarters show improving but still variable profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE       |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $10.00B   | -1.61%    |
| 2025-06-30 | $10.24B   | 0.22%     |

| 2024-09-30 | $10.24B   | -10.44%   |

*   **Analysis:** Equity has remained relatively stable around $10 billion. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) has been low and even negative in some quarters, indicating that the company is not effectively generating profits from its equity. The negative ROE in Q3 2024 and Q3 2025 (-10.44% and -1.61% respectively) is concerning.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Performance:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with high volatility and recent negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark.
*   **Technicals:** The stock is in a short-term uptrend, approaching overbought territory, with a possible buy signal forming.
*   **Sentiment:** News sentiment is mixed, with positive news about lithium prices offset by neutral ratings. Analyst consensus is generally positive, but with wide target price ranges.
*   **Financials:** Recent earnings show inconsistent profitability and negative EPS in several quarters. Revenue has been relatively stable, but profit margins and ROE have fluctuated significantly, with negative values in some quarters.
*   **Overall:** While there are some positive signs, such as rising lithium prices and analyst optimism, the inconsistent profitability, high volatility, and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 suggest caution. The high expected return should be viewed skeptically, given the company's recent struggles. The data paints a picture of a company with significant potential, but also significant risks. Further due diligence is recommended.
