The provided data shows an  absolute return difference of approximately -115.69%.  The relative divergence (0.2) indicates ALB's performance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in performance, ranging from substantial gains to significant losses year-over-year, highlighting the cyclical nature of the lithium market and ALB's dependence on it.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $89.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $100.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $100.06

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (31.07):** Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-1.89):**  Shows negative momentum, aligning with the price action below moving averages.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-2.3):** Indicates a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided data suggests no significant expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment, at least based on the metrics currently available.  This requires further investigation, particularly considering the volatile nature of ALB's historical performance.  

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows significant volatility:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates between $1.35B and $2.36B, indicating substantial swings in quarterly performance.  There is no clear upward trend.
* **EPS:** Shows large swings between significant profits and considerable losses.  The most recent quarter (2024-11-06) reported a substantial loss of -$9.45, a dramatic decline from the previous quarter's -$1.96 and the quarter before that's -$0.08. This highlights the risk inherent in ALB's business model and its exposure to commodity price volatility.  The repetition of the $2.58 EPS and $2.31B revenue figures suggests an error in the data set.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  The data reveals significant fluctuations in both revenue and profit margins, ranging from positive to significantly negative values.  This points to the considerable challenges ALB faces in maintaining consistent profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity levels fluctuate, and the Return on Equity (ROE) shows a similar volatile pattern, mirroring the instability observed in revenue and profit margins.  The negative ROE in recent quarters points to negative returns on shareholder capital.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions were provided to accompany the financial data.  An absence of recent news could indicate a period of relative quiet or a lack of readily available information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) shows a history of significant performance volatility, linked to the cyclical nature of the lithium market. While the stock is currently trading in oversold territory (RSI), the recent sharp decline in earnings (EPS) and the negative momentum (PPO) raise concerns. The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the lack of a clear upward trend in revenue or profit margins are major red flags.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent EPS plunge and the current market outlook are necessary before making any investment decision. The provided expected return of 0% underscores the need for thorough due diligence, particularly concerning the risks associated with this highly volatile sector.

**8. Conclusion:**

Based solely on the provided data, ALB presents a high-risk investment.  The significant underperformance versus the S&P 500, coupled with volatile earnings and negative momentum, warrants extreme caution.  Additional research into current market conditions, competitor analysis, and future growth prospects is crucial before considering any investment.  The apparent data error concerning duplicate EPS and Revenue figures should be clarified before drawing definitive conclusions.
