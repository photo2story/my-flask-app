Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine, serving various industries.

* **Cumulative Return Comparison:** ALB shows a cumulative return of -36.3%, while VOO achieved 85.4%.  The divergence is substantial (-121.7 points), placing ALB at the 1.5th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO (based on provided min/max).

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $66.5
* **Previous Close:** $72.25
* **Change:** -$7.96 (significant daily drop)
* **5-day MA:** $70.96
* **20-day MA:** $74.77
* **60-day MA:** $80.15

The price is below all three moving averages, reinforcing the downtrend.  The significant daily drop (-7.96) indicates a potential short-term bearish trend or market reaction to news.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 29.30 (Suggests oversold conditions, but should be interpreted cautiously in conjunction with other indicators)
* **PPO:** -0.85 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Divergence:** -0.5 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 3834.6% (This extremely high figure needs further explanation and context.  A 3834.6% return over 2+ years is highly unrealistic and requires clarification on the methodology used to derive this prediction).

The significant daily price drop needs further investigation to determine the underlying cause (e.g., news, earnings release, broader market trends).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There are substantial losses in several quarters (Q2 2024, Q3 2024, and Q4 2024), followed by a period of profitability in 2023.  This inconsistency requires further analysis to understand the underlying drivers.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45   | $1.35 B      |

| 2024-05-01 | -0.08   | $1.36 B      |
| 2023-11-01 | 2.58    | $2.31 B      |
| 2024-11-06 | 2.58    | $2.31 B      | *(Note: This appears to be a duplicate entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals declining revenue and significant profitability issues. Negative profit margins are prevalent in recent quarters, with a significant negative margin in Q4 2023. Return on Equity (ROE) is also volatile, reflecting the overall inconsistency in performance.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.23B | 11.22% |

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

ALB's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  While some technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, the underlying financial data reveals considerable volatility and profitability issues.  The extremely high projected return figure needs substantial clarification.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent earnings volatility and the rationale behind the projected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high beta suggests significant market risk.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence, including examining news and industry trends, before considering an investment in ALB.
