**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $86.53
* **5-day Moving Average:** $88.37
* **20-day Moving Average:** $91.34
* **60-day Moving Average:** $98.14

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 37.93 (Suggests the stock is potentially oversold, but not a definitive buy signal)

The price of $86.53 is below the moving averages, indicating a potential further downward trend.  The expected return of 4622.6% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is exceptionally high and should be treated with significant skepticism. This figure likely reflects the potential upside in a bull market scenario for lithium and related industries, but  it lacks context regarding risk and variability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ALB is currently experiencing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with alarming negative trends in recent earnings and financial statements. While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the negative PPO and the substantial decline in profitability raise serious concerns. The projected long-term return should be viewed with extreme caution, as it doesn't account for the current negative momentum and financial struggles. Further investigation into the causes of the recent decline in revenue and profitability is crucial before considering any investment.  The data provided suggests a high-risk investment at this time.
