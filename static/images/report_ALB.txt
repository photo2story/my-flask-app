## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.

Comparing ALB's cumulative return (-1.28%) to the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (122.16%) reveals a significant underperformance. The difference is a staggering 123.4%.  The provided relative divergence metric of 0.0 indicates ALB's performance is at its lowest point relative to the S&P 500 within the historical data range.  The CAGR data shows significant volatility, with periods of substantial gains and losses. The high Beta values (mostly above 8.0) suggest ALB's price is highly sensitive to overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $88.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $92.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $97.81

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  The price has recently experienced a decline (-1.16% from the previous close).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.89 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.43 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -2.9% (Short-term downward trend)

The negative price change (-1.16%) from the previous close, while not drastic, contributes to the short-term downward trend indicated by the relative divergence. The high expected return of 7316.6% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 suggests significant potential upside, but it should be viewed cautiously given the current underperformance and high volatility. This high expected return likely reflects the potential long-term growth in the lithium market, offsetting the high risks associated with ALB's high beta and recent underperformance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |

| 2024-11-06 | 2.58    | $2.31B       | *(Note: This appears to be a duplicate entry)*

Recent earnings show significant volatility, swinging from strong profitability to substantial losses. The substantial negative EPS in the last two quarters (-9.45 and -1.96) is highly concerning and warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.  The repeated entry for 2024-11-06 needs clarification.

**Capital and Profitability:**

|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $10.24B  | -10.44%     |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ALB has shown significant underperformance against the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility both in price and earnings. Recent quarters have revealed substantial losses, negatively impacting profit margins and ROE. While the long-term expected return is exceptionally high, the current state of the company calls for caution.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent losses is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high Beta suggests significant market risk.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential long-term growth in the lithium market against the considerable short-term risks.
