*   **Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests short-term positive momentum.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return (58.4%) is attractive but should be considered in the context of the company's volatility and risk profile.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:** Several recent news articles are positive, including UBS suggesting a lithium deficit could boost Albemarle stock, analysts lifting targets due to spiking lithium prices, and Albemarle leading the S&P 500 as lithium becomes an AI play.
*   **Institutional Investment:** Vontobel Holding Ltd. increasing its stake signals confidence from an institutional investor.

**Analysis:**

The news flow is largely positive, focusing on lithium market dynamics, analyst upgrades, and institutional investment. This positive sentiment could be contributing to the recent upward momentum in the stock price. The link to AI is interesting as it suggests a potential new growth driver for lithium demand.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.42)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 124.84 / High: 200.00 / Low: 75.00
*   **Rating Changes:** No specific recent changes are provided in the data.

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is currently a "Buy," suggesting that analysts generally believe the stock is undervalued. However, the wide range in target prices (75.00 to 200.00) indicates uncertainty and differing opinions on the stock's future performance. The current price of 150 is above the average target price.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출      |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | -1.72   | 1.31 B$   |
| 2025-08-04 | -0.16   | 1.33 B$   |
| 2025-04-30 | 0       | 1.08 B$   |
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45   | 1.35 B$   |
| 2025-11-05 | -9.45   | 1.35 B$   |

**Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows mixed results. Revenue has fluctuated, and Earnings Per Share (EPS) has been negative in most recent quarters. This suggests potential concerns about profitability despite relatively strong revenue. The repetition of the 2024-11-06 results for 2025-11-05 is likely an error.

**6. Financial Information: Revenue, Profitability and Capital**

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has been generally stable, fluctuating around $1.3 billion per quarter, but the most recent quarter saw a dip.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have been volatile, with a significant negative margin in Q3 2024 and fluctuating positive margins in subsequent quarters. The decrease in profit margin in the latest quarter is worth noting.
*   **Equity:** Equity has remained relatively stable.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) has also been volatile, mirroring the profit margin fluctuations. The negative ROE in recent quarters is a concern.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

Albemarle (ALB) presents a mixed picture. While recent news and short-term technical indicators are positive, several factors suggest caution.

*   **Underperformance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the longer term.
*   **High Volatility:** High MDD indicates significant risk.
*   **Mixed Financials:** Revenue is relatively stable, but profitability and ROE have been volatile and recently negative.
*   **Overbought:** The RSI suggests the stock may be overbought in the short term.
*   **Positive Catalysts:** Positive news flow related to lithium demand and institutional investment could support further price appreciation.
*   **Analyst Opinion:** The analyst consensus is "Buy," but the wide range in target prices reflects uncertainty.
*   **Lithium Market:** The future of the lithium market will be crucial for ALB's success.

**In summary:** ALB is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The positive momentum and potential catalysts in the lithium market are attractive, but investors should be aware of the company's volatility, underperformance relative to the broader market, and recent mixed financial results. A potential investment should be carefully considered in light of an investor's risk tolerance and investment horizon.
