**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 21.6 -  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -1.55 - Suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.3 - Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 7748.4% - This exceptionally high figure requires further clarification on the calculation methodology and assumptions.  It is likely an outlier and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  It is crucial to understand the basis for this projection before considering its validity.  A more conservative approach would involve assessing the historical and projected growth rates of ALB and comparing them against that of the S&P 500.  A high-growth potential scenario (above average growth for ALB exceeding that of the S&P 500) is implied but needs deeper backing.
* **Price Level:** The current price of $88.29 is significantly below recent averages. While oversold conditions suggest potential for a bounce, the overall trend appears bearish, and a significant upward movement would suggest a considerable market correction.

* **EPS:**  A dramatic shift from positive EPS in Q4 2023 ($2.58) to negative EPS in subsequent quarters.  This reflects a substantial deterioration in profitability.
* **Profitability:**  The profit margins show substantial negative values, highlighting significant losses in recent quarters.  A clear downward trend in profitability is obvious.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*No information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided.*  This is a critical missing element for a complete analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ALB is currently experiencing a significant downturn.  The stock price is below its moving averages, technical indicators are bearish, and recent earnings have shown a dramatic decline in revenue and profitability.  The substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, along with the highly volatile historical performance, highlights significant risk.  The extraordinarily high projected return of 7748.4% is highly suspect and should be disregarded until its calculation methodology is clarified and validated.  Further analysis, including information on recent news, analyst opinions, and market outlook, is essential for a comprehensive assessment of the investment potential.  Given the current bearish trends and recent financial performance, investing in ALB requires high risk tolerance.
