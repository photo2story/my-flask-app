**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data shows a zero percent expected return relative to the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  This likely reflects the significant underperformance relative to the market and requires further investigation to justify the projection. Given the substantial negative divergence between the stock price and performance of the S&P 500, the 0.0% is likely not a realistic expectation unless there's a significant shift in the company's fundamentals.

Revenue also decreased, from $2.31B in Q4 2023 to $1.35B in Q3 2024. This significant EPS decline and revenue decrease is a major negative factor.  The reported EPS and revenue figures show a clear downward trend.

Similarly, ROE dropped significantly from a positive 3.06% in Q3 2023 to a negative -10.44% in Q3 2024.
