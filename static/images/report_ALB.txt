**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The table reveals fluctuating alpha and beta values, indicating ALB's performance sensitivity to market movements (beta) and its ability to outperform the market (alpha) varies across different periods.  Noteworthy is the consistently high beta (significantly above 1) across most periods, highlighting ALB's higher volatility compared to the broader market.  The negative CAGR values in the later periods (-43%, -211%, -363%) highlight the significant downturn experienced by ALB recently, possibly related to market corrections in the lithium sector.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

ALB has experienced a severe downturn, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Negative earnings, high volatility (as indicated by high beta and MDD), and deteriorating financial health are key concerns.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions,  the prolonged downtrend and weak fundamentals raise serious questions about the stock's prospects.  The extremely high "expected return" needs substantial clarification.  Before considering any investment, a thorough investigation into the reasons behind the company's recent poor performance and a careful evaluation of the risks are crucial. The provided "expected return" of 14573.3% is unrealistic without a detailed explanation of its calculation methodology.  Further investigation into the company's future outlook, including industry trends and competitive landscape, is necessary.
