## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

ALB's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO).  Recent price action shows a downward trend, with the price below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages.  RSI suggests oversold conditions, while negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.  Earnings show significant volatility, with recent quarters experiencing losses.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine.  ALB's cumulative return of 5.48% is drastically underperforming the S&P 500's 76.18% return. The difference is -70.7%, placing it at the 5th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals substantial volatility in performance across different time periods. While some periods show high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others demonstrate significant negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The high beta values (especially in earlier periods) suggest that ALB's returns are highly sensitive to market movements. The increasingly negative CAGR and growing negative Alpha in the most recent periods are concerning.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $52.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $54.71
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $64.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $74.19

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $0.65 (from $52.57) is a relatively small change compared to the overall downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 28.86 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.76 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** 14535.0%  This exceptionally high number needs further clarification regarding its calculation and underlying assumptions.  It's likely an error or misinterpretation.  A 14535% return is unrealistic.

The combination of an oversold RSI and a negative PPO suggests potential for a bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish.  The small recent price increase is insufficient to signal a significant reversal. The extremely high expected return requires verification.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45   | $1.35 B       |
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96   | $1.43 B       |

| 2023-11-01 | 2.58    | $2.31 B       |
| 2024-11-06 | 2.58    | $2.31 B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*

Earnings show a significant deterioration from positive EPS in late 2023 to substantial losses in the recent quarters of 2024. Revenue has remained relatively stable, but the drastic decline in profitability is a major concern. The duplicate entry suggests data quality issues in the source.

The financial statements confirm a dramatic downturn in profitability throughout 2024.  While revenue has been relatively consistent, profit margins have swung sharply from positive to significantly negative.  ROE is also considerably depressed.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ALB is currently experiencing a significant downturn.  While past performance has shown periods of high growth, the recent trend is strongly negative, with considerable losses and significantly underperformance against the S&P 500.  The high beta indicates sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Technical indicators point to an oversold condition but do not signal an imminent reversal of the downward trend.  The financial statements paint a clear picture of declining profitability.  The extremely high projected return is highly suspect and requires re-evaluation.  Before considering investment, a thorough review of the underlying factors driving the recent performance decline is crucial, paying close attention to industry dynamics and ALB's strategic response. The data inconsistencies present in the provided data also need to be resolved before any conclusive analysis can be performed.
