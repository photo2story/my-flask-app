**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 143.93
*   **Previous Close:** 141.44
*   **Change:** 1.76
*   **5-day SMA:** 144.39
*   **20-day SMA:** 137.41
*   **60-day SMA:** 116.09

**Analysis:**

The current price is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the 5-day SMA is slightly above the current close, possibly indicating a minor short-term pullback or consolidation. The positive change from the previous close is small, suggesting moderate momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 63.53 (Approaching overbought territory but not there yet)
*   **PPO:** -0.72 (Slightly below zero, indicating a potential for upward movement)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (3 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -0.6 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 16.5% (Long-term outlook)

**Analysis:**

The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is approaching the overbought level, suggesting the price may be due for a pullback. The PPO is slightly negative, which could signal a buying opportunity if it starts to turn positive. The hybrid signal is providing a buy signal, based on risk assessment, despite the other indicators. The negative short-term divergence suggests caution. The 16.5% expected return is a potentially positive signal, but needs to be balanced against the other factors.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive News:** The news headlines are largely positive, focusing on:
    *   Potential lithium deficit boosting the stock
    *   Rising lithium prices and analysts raising targets
    *   Increased holdings by investment firms
    *   Strong lithium production outlook
    *   Lithium becoming an AI play
    *   Potential for income generation from the stock

**Analysis:**

Recent news sentiment appears strongly positive, likely driving the recent stock price increase. The focus on lithium demand driven by AI and EV adoption is a key bullish factor.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Not provided with a clear rating.
*   **Target Price:** Average: $124.84, High: $200.00, Low: $75.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not provided.

**Analysis:**

The analyst target price is significantly lower than the current price. This divergence suggests analysts may believe the stock is overvalued in the short term or that the recent positive news is already priced in. The wide range between the high and low target prices highlights uncertainty about the stock's future performance. The missing recent rating changes means we cannot assess current analyst conviction.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | -1.72 | 1.31 B$   |
| 2025-08-04 | -0.16 | 1.33 B$   |
| 2025-04-30 | 0     | 1.08 B$   |
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45 | 1.35 B$   |
| 2025-11-05 | -9.45 | 1.35 B$   |

**Analysis:**

The EPS (Earnings Per Share) has been volatile and mostly negative recently. While revenue has been relatively consistent (around $1.3B, except for a drop in 2025-04-30), the lack of profitability is a concern. The most recent EPS is significantly negative.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $1.31B   | 8.99%         |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.33B   | 14.80%         |
| 2025-03-31   | $1.08B   | 14.51%         |
| 2024-12-31   | $1.23B   | 11.22%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $1.35B   | -7.68%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE       |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $10.00B  | -1.61%    |
| 2025-06-30   | $10.24B  | 0.22%     |

| 2024-09-30   | $10.24B  | -10.44%   |

**Analysis:**

The revenue data confirms the consistency mentioned above. The profit margin has fluctuated significantly, even being negative in one quarter, which can be a point of concern. The ROE (Return on Equity) has also been volatile and mainly negative. This implies difficulty in generating profits from shareholder equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

ALB presents a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:** Recent positive news related to lithium demand, a medium MRI score, a potentially attractive expected return, and a buy signal from the hybrid model. Short term moving average trends are positive.
*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, recent negative earnings, volatile financials, high beta, increasing MDD, negative Alpha, and analyst target prices below the current price, and potentially overbought RSI. Recent divergence change is negative.

**Conclusion:**

ALB appears to be experiencing a short-term boost driven by positive news surrounding the lithium market. However, underlying financial performance and analyst expectations suggest caution. The stock is riskier than the overall market. A potential investor should carefully weigh the growth potential of the lithium market against ALB's volatile financials and significant underperformance. Given the negative recent earnings and lower analyst targets, it might be prudent to wait for more concrete signs of improvement in financial performance before considering a long-term investment, despite the positive outlook for lithium and the recent positive news sentiment.
