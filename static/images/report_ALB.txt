## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.  As of the last data point, ALB's cumulative return is 21.14%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 123.86%.  The difference is -102.72%, placing it at the 6th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates ALB has lagged significantly behind the broader market over the period considered. The provided CAGR data shows high volatility in performance over different periods, ranging from substantial gains to significant losses, highlighting the cyclical nature of the business.

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential medium-term support.  The relatively close proximity of the 20-day and 60-day moving averages might signal a period of consolidation or indecision in the market's assessment of ALB's future performance.

The closing price of $103.55 is not significantly different enough from the closing price to indicate a sharp upward or downward movement.  Additional context or a longer time frame would provide greater clarity.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows a highly volatile performance with significant fluctuations in both EPS and revenue. Recent quarters (2024) exhibit significant losses, contrasting sharply with profitability in the previous year (2023).  The last reported EPS of -9.45 is substantially negative, indicating a significant loss. This needs further investigation, analyzing the specific reasons behind the dramatic fall in profitability to understand the short and long-term prospects of the company.  A comparison of the actual results with analyst expectations is crucial for a complete evaluation.  The dramatic change from positive EPS in 2023 to heavily negative EPS in 2024 calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying causes.

**5. Quarterly Financial Data Analysis (Revenue and Profitability):**

The provided data reveals a fluctuating pattern in revenue and profitability. While there are quarters with positive profit margins (e.g., Q1 2024), other periods show significant losses (e.g., Q4 2023, Q3 & Q4 2024).  ROE also displays significant volatility, transitioning from positive values to substantial negative values within a short timeframe, highlighting the need for a comprehensive analysis of the business operations and underlying market dynamics affecting profitability.

**6. Capital and Profitability:**

The equity fluctuates slightly, suggesting overall stability. The ROE shows a marked fluctuation. Such volatility in ROE, often associated with cyclical industries, needs closer examination of the specific drivers influencing its swings. This requires delving deeper into the company's financial statements to understand the contributing factors to these fluctuations and to provide more context for interpreting the trends and their potential impact on future performance.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires access to real-time news sources like Shacknews and Finbold to provide relevant information on recent earnings news, analyst opinions, and market outlook.  Without access, I cannot fulfill this request.)

**8. Overall Analysis:**

ALB exhibits substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the specified period. While some short-term technical indicators hint at potential upward momentum, the recent negative earnings significantly temper any optimism.  The substantial volatility in both profitability and ROE underscores the cyclical nature of the business. A deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent significant losses, alongside an evaluation of analyst expectations, is essential before forming a comprehensive investment opinion.  The 0% expected long-term return relative to the S&P 500, based on the current information, does not favor a long-term investment unless a thorough analysis reveals reasons for this outlook to change dramatically.
