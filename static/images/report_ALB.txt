## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB), a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return for ALB is -4.03%, while VOO shows a 119.94% return. This represents a massive divergence of -123.97%.  The provided relative divergence of 0.4 indicates ALB's performance is near the lower end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  The historical alpha and beta values fluctuate considerably, suggesting high volatility and varying sensitivity to market movements.  The consistently low alpha across different periods also implies ALB hasn't consistently outperformed the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $86.28
* **5-day Moving Average:** $87.90
* **20-day Moving Average:** $89.71
* **60-day Moving Average:** $97.34

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the previous close suggests a modest increase rather than a significant surge or plunge.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (43.41):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 50), suggesting potential for a price rebound, but not definitively bullish.
* **PPO (-0.23):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (0.3):** Positive change suggests a short-term upward trend.  However, this must be considered in conjunction with the negative PPO and overall downtrend suggested by the moving averages.

The stated expected return of 7184.1% is exceptionally high and seems unrealistic without further justification or explanation of the underlying model and assumptions.  It's crucial to treat this figure with extreme skepticism.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility and a recent decline in profitability.  The two entries for 2024-11-06 are duplicated and inconsistent.  Q3 2024 shows a substantial loss (-$9.45 EPS), contrasting sharply with a profit in Q1 2024. This suggests possible underlying challenges impacting the company's performance.  Further investigation into the reasons for the dramatic swings in EPS is necessary.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data reveals significant fluctuations in profitability and equity. Profit margins have swung from positive to negative repeatedly, highlighting financial instability.  Similarly, Return on Equity (ROE) has seen dramatic changes, fluctuating between strong positive and significant negative values. This instability points to considerable risk for investors.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp is currently experiencing significant financial challenges, reflected in declining earnings, negative profit margins, and a substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound, the negative PPO and position below moving averages suggest a prevailing downtrend.  The exceptionally high projected return should be disregarded given its implausibility.  The company's financial instability presents considerable risk.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the reasons behind the erratic financial performance and a thorough review of the company's long-term prospects, is crucial before considering any investment.  The currently available data does not support a bullish outlook.
