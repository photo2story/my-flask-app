**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha and beta values show significant volatility and inconsistency in ALB's performance relative to the market (presumably represented by the index used for the beta calculation).  High beta values (e.g., 13.8) indicate high sensitivity to market movements, while the fluctuating alpha suggests periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market's benchmark.  Note that negative CAGR values in some periods indicate significant losses. The extremely large negative CAGRs in the final three years are especially concerning.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($57.44) is below both the 5-day ($57.85) and 20-day ($56.64) moving averages, suggesting a recent pullback.  However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average ($68.38), indicating a more substantial downward trend over the longer term.  The last market close shows a slight increase ($0.85).


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (64.42):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but is approaching the overbought territory.
* **PPO (1.15):** A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence (+0.1):** Shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (14024.8%):** This extraordinarily high figure needs clarification.  The methodology for calculating this expected return is crucial and needs to be examined. Without knowing the calculation process, this number is not credible.  Further, a 2-year timeframe is not "long-term" in the context of investing.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility and recent losses.  Revenue remains relatively consistent but EPS has significantly declined into negative territory.  This warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.

| Date       | EPS       | Revenue     |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-04-30 | $0        | $1.08 B     |

| 2025-04-30 | -$0.08    | $1.36 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals a concerning trend. While revenue is relatively stable, profit margins have fluctuated dramatically, turning sharply negative in Q3 2024. Equity has decreased, and ROE shows inconsistency, with significant negative values.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $1.08B     | 14.51%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.23B     | 11.22%        |

| 2024-12-31 | $9.96B     | 0.76%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $10.24B    | -10.44%       |

| 2024-03-31 | $11.53B    | 0.02%        |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) shows significant volatility and underperformance against the S&P 500.  Recent financial results indicate declining profitability and inconsistent returns. While the recent slight price increase and positive PPO suggest some short-term bullish momentum, the larger trend is bearish.  The extremely negative CAGRs, particularly in the recent years, are a major red flag.  The exceptionally high "expected return" requires thorough examination of its calculation methodology before being considered.  A thorough investigation into the reasons behind the dramatic decrease in EPS and profit margins is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Given the current data, ALB appears to be a high-risk investment with significant downside potential.
