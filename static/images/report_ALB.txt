## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Report

**0. Overview:** Albemarle Corporation is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Albemarle (ALB) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While ALB showed a cumulative return of 10.20%, VOO achieved a return of 71.02%. The difference is -60.8%, placing it at the 3.6th percentile of the historical range of differences (min -73.9%, max 294.2%).  This indicates ALB's performance was substantially below the market benchmark.

The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta data highlights significant volatility in ALB's performance relative to the market (Beta).  While periods of extremely high CAGR exist (e.g., 2019-2021, 2020-2022), these are punctuated by periods of substantial negative returns.  The high Beta values suggest ALB's returns are highly sensitive to market movements, often exceeding the market's volatility. The Alpha values fluctuate, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return.  The substantial market cap fluctuations further emphasize the inherent volatility associated with this stock.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $58.51
* **Last Day Change:** -$12.02 (a significant drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $68.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $79.64

The stock price is currently trading significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a strong downward trend.  The recent large negative change (-12.02) suggests a potential sharp price correction or market reaction to negative news.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk) This indicates elevated risk associated with the market.
* **RSI:** 8.29 (Extremely oversold)  A very low RSI suggests the stock is heavily oversold and may be due for a rebound, though it does not guarantee a price increase.
* **PPO:** -1.81 (Bearish) A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.9 (Short-term upward momentum). While the Relative Divergence shows a short-term positive momentum, the RSI and PPO indicators contradict this.

The sharp drop in price ('change': -12.02) indicates a significant negative event impacting the stock, potentially driving this divergence.

* **Expected Return:** 3701.8% This incredibly high projected return should be treated with significant skepticism.  It's crucial to understand the underlying model and assumptions used for this prediction, as such a high number is highly unrealistic and likely based on optimistic, potentially unfounded scenarios.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals significant volatility and recent losses.  While Q4 2023 showed positive EPS, subsequent quarters have shown substantial losses, accompanied by fluctuating revenue.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle (ALB) shows significant underperformance against the S&P 500, coupled with high volatility and substantial financial challenges. The recent sharp price drop, low RSI, negative PPO, and the significant negative earnings in recent quarters paint a bearish picture. While the high projected return is intriguing, it's unrealistic and should be disregarded without a thorough understanding of the methodology behind it.  The high risk indicated by the MRI adds further caution.  A deep dive into the reasons for the recent negative earnings and revenue decline is essential before considering any investment. The current situation strongly suggests ALB is a high-risk investment at this time. Further investigation into the underlying causes for the recent financial performance downturn is crucial before making any investment decisions.
