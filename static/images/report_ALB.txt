**2. Recent Price Movement:**

ALB's recent price action shows a downtrend. The current price (80.46) is significantly below all three moving averages (5-day: 84.50, 20-day: 89.35, 60-day: 96.64), suggesting bearish momentum. The recent price drop of -4.43% reinforces this bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (28.31):**  Indicates oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a bounce, but not necessarily a reversal of the downtrend.
* **PPO (-0.82):** Negative value signifies bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (-0.9):**  Confirms the short-term bearish trend.

The substantial projected long-term expected return (7136.6%) needs further clarification.  This extremely high figure requires a detailed explanation of the underlying assumptions and methodology, especially given the recent poor performance.  It's crucial to understand how this estimate accounts for the high volatility and risk associated with ALB.
