**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

ALB's recent performance is concerning. It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with negative alpha values in recent years. While recent news suggests potential positive catalysts related to lithium demand, the company is currently loss-making, shows fluctuating profitability and negative ROE. Analyst ratings are mixed, with a "Buy" consensus but an average target price below the current market price and a wide range in price targets, reflecting high uncertainty. The technical indicators present a mixed picture. The short-term moving averages suggest a possible upward trend, but the overall financial performance and recent earnings data raise significant concerns. The board member resignation adds another layer of uncertainty. *Therefore, based on this data, investing in ALB would be considered high risk.* Potential investors should thoroughly research the company's turnaround plans and the lithium market dynamics before making any decisions. The very high 'Expected Return' should be taken with a grain of salt, as this is a model-based prediction and historical performance indicates that ALB's volatility may yield negative returns over long time periods.
