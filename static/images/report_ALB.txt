## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and bromine-based specialty chemicals.  As of the last data point, ALB's cumulative return (27.40%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (129.75%).  The difference is a substantial -102.4%, placing it at the 6.1st percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.

The consistently negative alpha suggests that ALB has underperformed its expected return based on its beta (market risk).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $109.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $108.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $105.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $98.11

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day and 20-day averages suggests a relatively stable trend in the last few weeks.  However, the significant difference between the 60-day average and the current price implies a sharper upward trend over a longer timeframe. The last market price (101.92) was significantly lower than the current closing price, indicating a recent, substantial price increase.  This could be due to positive market sentiment or a specific event (this should be further investigated).

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (59.74):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO (-0.0094):**  Slightly negative, suggesting a weak short-term momentum. The negative PPO is consistent with the negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, further indicating a short term decline.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (NaN):**  The missing data prevents a clear interpretation of recent relative strength changes.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** This indicates that, based on available data, there’s no expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  Given the historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the lack of notable recent positive catalysts, a conservative outlook is warranted.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's a dramatic drop in EPS and revenue from Q3 2023 to Q3 2024, followed by a slight increase in Q2 2024. There are also significant losses in both EPS and revenue recorded in Q4 2024.   Profitability is highly variable, swinging between significant profits and losses across quarters.  Without access to analyst expectations, it's impossible to determine whether these results beat or missed expectations. The repetition of the 2023-11-01 data suggests a possible reporting error. This inconsistency necessitates a review of the source data to ensure accuracy.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data confirms the volatility observed in the earnings.  Revenue fluctuates considerably across quarters.  Profit margins are highly variable, shifting between substantial profits and significant losses.  Equity also exhibits variability, reflecting the company's volatile financial performance.  ROE is significantly negative in several quarters, indicating the company’s difficulties in generating returns on invested equity. The data clearly shows periods of strong profitability followed by substantial losses.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This crucial contextual information is missing and would significantly impact the overall analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp has shown significant volatility and underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Recent price movements suggest a short-term uptrend, but the overall picture is one of instability.  The inconsistent earnings and financial data, combined with the missing news and analyst opinions, prevent a definitive conclusion on its investment potential.  The negative alpha and significant swings in profitability raise concerns about consistent long-term performance.  Further investigation is needed, particularly clarifying the earnings data inconsistencies and incorporating up-to-date market analysis and analyst opinions.  The current data suggests a high-risk investment with uncertain long-term prospects, despite the recent price increase.  A thorough review of the fundamentals and market context is crucial before making any investment decisions.
