**Analysis of Alpha and Beta:** The high beta values indicate ALB's price movements are highly sensitive to overall market fluctuations.  The fluctuating alpha suggests inconsistent outperformance relative to the market.  The recent negative CAGRs and substantial negative alphas suggest significant underperformance compared to the market in the last few years.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

The stock price has recently shown a downward trend.  The price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating bearish momentum in the short to medium term.  The small negative change in the last day (-0.28) does not indicate a significant sudden drop.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (48.43):**  Indicates the stock is nearing oversold territory, but not yet significantly so.  Further decline could push it into oversold conditions.
* **PPO (-0.34):** Negative PPO confirms the bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-0.6):**  Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):**  A value of 0.4382 suggests low risk, suggesting the market may be less volatile in the current period than in past periods.
* **Expected Return (3218.7%):** This extraordinarily high expected return needs further investigation and clarification on the methodology used to arrive at this figure. It seems unrealistic and should be treated with extreme caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45   | 1.35 B$       |
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96   | 1.43 B$       |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.08   | 1.36 B$       |
| 2023-11-01 | 2.58    | 2.31 B$       |
| 2024-11-06 | 2.58    | 2.31 B$       | *(Note: Duplicate entry)*

**Analysis:** The recent earnings show a significant decline in profitability, with substantial EPS losses in the last three quarters. There appears to be a data duplication for November 6, 2024 which needs clarification.  Revenue has remained relatively stable but profits have drastically fallen.  This substantial decline in profitability needs further investigation.

| 2023-12-31 | $9.41B | -6.56% |

**Analysis:**  The financial data reveals a concerning trend of declining profitability and fluctuating equity.  Profit margins have swung dramatically between positive and negative values, indicating significant volatility and potentially underlying operational challenges.  ROE has also been largely negative recently, suggesting a problem with return on shareholder investment.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period, showing a substantial negative return difference. Recent earnings show a sharp decline in profitability despite relatively stable revenues. Technical indicators point towards bearish momentum, although the RSI suggests the stock is not extremely oversold.  The exceptionally high expected return needs further scrutiny.  The company's high beta suggests significant sensitivity to market movements.  Overall, the financial and performance data paint a picture of a company facing challenges, requiring further investigation to understand the reasons behind the recent performance decline and to determine if the current valuation reflects these challenges accurately.  The extremely high projected long-term return requires clarification of the model used to make that prediction.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.
