* **20-Day Moving Average:** $80.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $89.54

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price increase from the previous close ($77.53 to $78.97) indicates a short-term upward movement, though this might be a temporary bounce within a broader downtrend.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 2031.8% (This exceptionally high figure needs further clarification regarding its calculation and assumptions. A 2031.8% return significantly exceeds reasonable expectations and needs detailed justification).  The significant price change from the previous close (1.86%) suggests a potential market reaction to recent news or events; this requires further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ALB's performance is currently significantly lagging the S&P 500.  While short-term indicators suggest a potential upward bounce, the underlying financial data reveals serious concerns regarding profitability and overall financial health.  The recent sharp decline in earnings is especially troubling.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return requires substantial clarification.  Before considering any investment, a thorough analysis of the factors driving the recent earnings decline and a more realistic assessment of future prospects are crucial.  The high volatility and negative alphas suggest that ALB is a risky investment, and investors should proceed with caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent poor performance, including industry-specific factors and company-specific news, is needed before making any investment decision.
