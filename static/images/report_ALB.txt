Here's a comprehensive analysis of Albemarle Corp (ALB) based on the provided data:

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** Albemarle Corp is a specialty chemicals manufacturing company specializing in lithium, bromine specialties, and catalysts.
*   **Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**
    *   ALB Cumulative Return: 20.20%
    *   VOO Cumulative Return: 100.36%
    *   Divergence: -76.5
    *   Relative Divergence: 14.2
*   **Analysis:** ALB has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial divergence in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 14.2 suggests this underperformance is closer to the historical minimum divergence than the maximum.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**
    *   The Alpha values are largely negative, especially recently indicating that ALB is underperforming relative to its expected return based on its beta.
    *   Beta fluctuates; overall showing it behaves similarly to the market but occasionally has inverse correlation (-0.1, -0.9), suggesting it sometimes moves against the market trends. The recent betas (0.5 and 0.3) show a positive correlation but not extremely strong, indicating moderate responsiveness to market movements.
    *   CAGR shows high volatility, with significant gains and losses over different periods. Recent performance is trending negative.
    *   MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, reflecting the stock's volatile nature and potential for significant losses.
    *   Capitalization has decreased.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $124.72
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $124.87, Previous Close: $128.14, Change: -$2.55
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: $127.2575
    *   20-day SMA: $113.5065
    *   60-day SMA: $96.833
*   **Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day SMA, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, the 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA. This moving average configuration typically indicates an uptrend but it may be weakening as it has fallen for 3 days. The negative change from the previous close further confirms the recent downside.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 70.12 (Approaching overbought conditions)
*   **PPO:** 0.3961 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 1.3 (+) Short term rise
*   **Expected Return:** 118.1% (Excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The high MRI suggests a potentially favorable time for investment, but this should be tempered with other indicators.
    *   The RSI near 70 suggests the stock is approaching overbought conditions, potentially indicating a pullback is due.
    *   The positive PPO indicates upward momentum, but its value is relatively low.
    *   The hybrid signal suggests buying based on the MRI, but it also notes that the holding is very safe.
    *   The large negative change between price and previous close suggests volatility and price instability.
    *   The exceptionally high expected return (118.1%) should be viewed with caution, as it might be based on overly optimistic projections or a rebound from a recent downturn.

    *   Analyst actions: Price target upgrades and downgrades, suggesting mixed opinions.
    *   Institutional activity: Quantbot Technologies LP acquiring shares.
    *   Lithium as an AI play: Connecting Albemarle to the AI trend through lithium demand.
*   **Analysis:** The news indicates a mixed sentiment surrounding Albemarle. Analyst upgrades and institutional investment are positive, but downgrades and concerns about a global slowdown introduce uncertainty. The connection to the lithium/AI theme could be a long-term growth driver.

*   **Target Price:** Average: $107.14, High: $200.00, Low: $58.00

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -1.72 | 1.31 B$      |
| 2025-08-04 | -0.16 | 1.33 B$      |
| 2025-04-30 | 0     | 1.08 B$      |

| 2025-11-05 | -9.45 | 1.35 B$      |

*   **Analysis:** ALB's recent earnings have been mixed. There are multiple instances of the same date/revenue, which indicates an error, however, given that the EPS is negative in three of the last four quarters, and the most recent EPS is heavily negative at -9.45, with revenues fluctuating, this indicates potential challenges in maintaining profitability.

**6) Financial Information:**

| 2025-09-30   | $1.31B    | 8.99%         |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.33B    | 14.80%        |

|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $10.00B   | -1.61%    |
| 2025-06-30   | $10.24B   | 0.22%     |

| 2024-09-30   | $10.24B   | -10.44%   |

*   **Analysis:** The company's revenue has fluctuated over the last five quarters. While profit margins have generally been positive, the negative margin in 2024-09-30 is a concern. The negative ROE in two of the last five quarters indicates that the company has not been effectively using equity to generate profits.

The negative earnings, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and volatile stock price suggest caution.
