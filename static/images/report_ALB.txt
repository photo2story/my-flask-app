## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Albemarle Corp (ALB) is a leading global producer of lithium and other specialty chemicals.

The cumulative return for ALB is -1.28%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 52.12%.  This represents a significant underperformance of ALB compared to the S&P 500, with a difference of **-53.30%**. The provided relative divergence of -53.4 indicates ALB's performance is considerably below the S&P 500, placing it at the lower end of historical performance relative to the index. The provided CAGR data highlights significant volatility and negative returns over the past few years. This drastic difference is alarming and warrants further investigation.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | 170.0% | 21.6%  | 172.0% | 1.0   | 24.9   |
| 2021-2023  | -62.0% | 25.1%  | -71.0% | 1.0   | 16.7   |
| 2022-2024  | -184.0%| 25.1%  | -207.0%| 1.0   | 10.1   |
| 2023-2025  | -231.0%| 25.1%  | -273.0%| 1.0   | 10.4   |

The high volatility is evident, with significant swings in CAGR and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The consistently high alpha values may be misleading due to the overall negative CAGR in recent years.  The Beta of approximately 1 indicates a similar volatility to the market, though the recent performance drastically diverges.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $88.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $92.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $97.81

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price drop of $1.16 (from $89.80) further supports this bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.89 (Slightly above the neutral 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.43 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.1% (Short-term bearish trend)

The price drop of $1.16 is significant but doesn't necessarily indicate a "crash" scenario. The combination of RSI and PPO indicates a relatively neutral to mildly bullish trend, but the negative divergence and the price being below moving averages present conflicting signals.  The incredibly high projected return of 8208.5% is unrealistic and likely based on an extremely optimistic and unsupported model.  The probability of achieving this level of return compared to the S&P 500 over two years is extremely low.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45  | $1.35 B      |
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96  | $1.43 B      |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.08  | $1.36 B      |
| 2023-11-01 | 2.58   | $2.31 B      |
| 2024-11-06 | 2.58   | $2.31 B      | *(Possible data entry error: Duplicate entry)*


The most recent earnings show a significant decline in EPS and revenue. The massive negative EPS in the November 2024 quarter is extremely concerning and requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.  The duplicate entry for November 2024 needs clarification.  This data clearly points towards a significant downturn in the company's performance.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.35B | -7.68%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.43B | -0.74%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.36B | 2.86%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.36B | -29.88%      |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.31B | 2.38%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE          |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $10.24B | -10.44%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $11.22B | -1.68%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.53B | 0.02%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.41B  | -6.56%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $9.90B  | 3.06%        |

Both revenue and profitability metrics show a significant decline in recent quarters.  Negative profit margins and a negative Return on Equity (ROE) are particularly worrying.  The financial health of the company appears to be deteriorating rapidly.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ALB is currently experiencing a severe downturn.  The negative earnings, declining revenue, negative profit margins, and significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 paint a bleak picture. While some technical indicators show hints of bullish momentum, the fundamental issues are far more significant and overshadow any positive technical signals.  The projected 8208.5% return is highly improbable and should be disregarded.  A thorough investigation into the reasons behind the recent drastic decline in earnings and revenue is crucial before considering any investment. The high volatility also increases the risk.  Given the current state of affairs, ALB appears to be a high-risk investment with a significant downside potential.
