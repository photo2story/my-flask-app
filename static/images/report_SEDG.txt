**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimizers, inverters, and energy management solutions.  Over the period analyzed, SEDG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for SEDG is -73.23%, while VOO shows a 124.38% return. This results in a substantial divergence of -297.61 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -197.61, placing it at the 7th percentile of the historical range (-198.51 to 1031.53), further underscores this underperformance.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals high volatility and significant beta values (mostly above 1), indicating substantial sensitivity to market movements.  While past CAGR figures were impressive in some periods, the recent performance (-69.9% and -96.2% CAGR in the last two years) demonstrates significant downturn.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures consistently highlight the considerable risk associated with investing in SEDG.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** $10.87
* **5-day Moving Average:** $11.13
* **20-day Moving Average:** $14.56
* **60-day Moving Average:** $18.34

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The distance from the 60-day MA indicates a considerable decline from recent highs.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (26.57):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce. However, this alone is not a buy signal.
* **PPO (-3.01):**  Negative value confirms a bearish trend.
* **Relative Strength (20-day change):** A positive change of 0.07 suggests a recent minor upward movement, but it's too early to confirm a trend reversal.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  Given the recent performance, the projected long-term (2+ years) return relative to the S&P 500 is currently neutral.  This should be viewed cautiously, as it's an estimate based on limited data and current conditions.  The current price of $10.87 does not represent a significant or sudden price jump.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows significant losses in recent quarters.  Revenue has decreased, and the company is reporting substantial net losses.  The significant negative EPS figures in the last few quarters indicate a severe financial downturn.  The lack of forecast data for the latest quarter makes it impossible to assess whether the performance met expectations or not.

**5. Financial Information Analysis (Revenue & Profitability, Capital & Profitability):**

The financial statements reveal a dramatic shift from profitability to significant losses in recent quarters.  The extremely negative profit margins (-269.19% in Q3 2024) are alarming and indicate major operational challenges. The negative Return on Equity (ROE) figures across the last several quarters, especially the -126.03% in Q3 2024, signal serious concerns regarding capital efficiency and profitability.  This suggests a need for significant operational restructuring and improved management.
