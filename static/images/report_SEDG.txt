**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |

**Analysis:** This table reveals a dramatic shift in SEDG's performance.  The early periods (2015-2021) showed extremely high growth (CAGR) and significant alpha generation, indicating outperformance relative to its benchmark, albeit with high maximum drawdowns (MDD).  However, the last three periods (2021-2025) show catastrophic declines, with massively negative CAGR and alpha.  The beta values suggest a moderate correlation with the market (S&P 500) during the decline, meaning it's been moving in the same direction as the market but with amplified negative returns.  The market capitalization has also decreased sharply, reflecting the stock's plummeting value.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Last Price:** 25.34
*   **Last Market:** Price: 27.54, Previous Close: 23.6, Change: 16.69
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 21.49
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 19.66
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 16.82

**Analysis:** The recent price of 25.34 is above all the moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. The Last Market data showing a price of 27.54 and a significant change of 16.69 indicates a strong recent upward surge. The price is above the 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term bullish trend. The large change from the previous close suggests a significant event or catalyst driving the price increase.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.0579 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 59.84 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 2.14
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (Very Safe - MRI:0.07)
*   **Recent Relative Deviation Change (20-day):** 0.3 (Positive - Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 21570.7% (Projected long-term excess return vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a low-risk environment, which may be misleading given the company's recent financial struggles. The RSI is nearing the overbought level, indicating the recent price surge might be unsustainable in the very short term. The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is positive, confirming the upward momentum. The hybrid signal is a "Buy," but this should be viewed cautiously in light of other concerning indicators. The positive change in relative deviation suggests short-term improvement. The exceptionally high expected return should be treated with extreme skepticism, given the recent performance and financial data.  Such a high projected return is unlikely and suggests potential inaccuracies in the model.

| 2024-03-31 | $2.24B  | -7.02%     |

**Analysis:** The financial data confirms the concerning trends seen in the earnings reports. While there was a slight positive profit margin in the most recent quarter (2025-03-31), the previous quarters show extremely negative profit margins. The Return on Equity (ROE) is also consistently negative and, at times, drastically so, indicating poor capital allocation and significant losses. The decreasing equity also reflects the financial strain on the company.

### 7. Overall Analysis

SolarEdge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) is currently facing significant challenges. The company has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, with negative earnings, declining profitability, and shrinking equity. While there has been a recent price surge and some short-term positive indicators, the underlying financial data paints a concerning picture.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Severe Underperformance:** SEDG has significantly lagged the market.
*   **Financial Distress:** Negative earnings, poor profitability, and declining equity are major red flags.
*   **High Volatility:** The stock is experiencing significant price swings.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While some technical indicators suggest short-term upward momentum, the fundamental data remains weak.
*   **Risk Considerations:** Despite the low MRI, the overall risk profile appears high due to the company's financial difficulties.

**Recommendation:**

Given the negative financial trends, high volatility, and significant underperformance, a cautious approach is warranted. The recent price surge should be viewed with skepticism. Further investigation into the causes of the financial distress and the company's plans for recovery is essential before considering any investment. The extraordinarily high projected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism.
