## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.  Over the period reviewed, SEDG experienced a cumulative return of -65.37%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 116.28%.  The difference in cumulative returns is -182.2%, placing it at the 9th percentile (0.9 on a 0-1 scale) of past performance divergence relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates SEDG's substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data shows periods of significant growth followed by drastic declines in recent years.  The high beta values (particularly in 2018-2020 and 2019-2021) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $14.77
* **Last Market Price:** $14.83
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.76

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it sits below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential bearish trend in the medium term.  The Last Market Price being only slightly above the closing price suggests minimal movement in the immediate aftermath of the market close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.59 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.22 (Positive; suggests bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +0.9 (Short-term upward trend)

Given that the RSI is near the neutral zone, PPO is slightly positive and the short-term trend is positive, the market indicates a mixed outlook. The significant negative cumulative return over the period significantly impacts the expected return. With a current expected return of 0.0%,  long-term (2+ years) investment in SEDG with a dollar-cost averaging strategy would likely underperform the S&P 500 based on historical performance. Any substantial price increase beyond the provided last market price of $14.83 would suggest a rapid positive shift in market sentiment but should be viewed cautiously considering the long-term underperformance.
