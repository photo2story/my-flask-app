**Analysis:**

*   **Past Performance:** From 2017-2022, SEDG exhibited strong growth (high CAGR) and significant outperformance relative to the market (high Alpha).
*   **Recent Performance:**  Since 2021, the company has experienced a dramatic reversal, with deeply negative CAGRs and Alphas, indicating substantial underperformance. This is coupled with high MDD (Maximum Drawdown), highlighting significant volatility.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are relatively low, suggesting SEDG's price movements were not strongly correlated with the broader market, particularly in the earlier periods. Beta increased to 0.5-0.6 recently, indicating increased market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **Current Price:** 34.42
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 33.44, Previous Close: 34.42, Change: -2.85%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 33.84
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 30.83
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 26.38

**Analysis:** The stock price has recently decreased and is trading above all three moving averages, which might suggest upward trend but needs confirmation (given the recent drop). The recent price decrease of -2.85% from the previous close indicates selling pressure.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 65.68 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.2111 (Positive, but relatively small)

*   **Recent Change in Relative Divergence (20 days):** 0.3 (+) - Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return:** 13952.2% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests relatively low market risk.
*   **RSI:** Suggests the stock is approaching overbought conditions, which *could* lead to a pullback.
*   **PPO:** Indicates positive momentum, but the magnitude is not particularly strong.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests a cautious buy signal.
*   **Recent Change in Relative Divergence:** Supports a recent upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extremely high expected return figure should be viewed with *extreme* skepticism. It's likely based on an algorithm that is extrapolating from a very volatile period and potentially doesn't account for fundamental changes in the company or industry.

**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis):**

SolarEdge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) presents a highly risky investment opportunity based on the provided data.

*   **Negative Performance:** The company has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and recent performance metrics (CAGR, Alpha) are deeply negative.
*   **Financial Distress:**  Consistent negative EPS, fluctuating revenue, and negative ROE point to serious financial challenges.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analyst opinions are generally neutral to negative, with a wide range of price targets indicating uncertainty and the low target of $7 suggesting significant downside risk.
*   **News & Events:** Recent news highlights the stock's downward pressure and a lack of positive catalysts.
*   **Technical Indicators:** While some technical indicators (recent change in relative divergence, trading above moving averages) suggest a potential short-term rebound, the overall fundamental picture is weak.

**Conclusion:** While the Market Risk Indicator is relatively low, the fundamental and market sentiment surrounding SolarEdge suggests it is a high-risk investment. The extremely high "expected return" should not be taken at face value given the company's current financial situation and negative trends. Further, recent news articles indicate significant market concerns about the company's current trajectory. A potential investor should proceed with extreme caution, conduct thorough due diligence, and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in SEDG.
