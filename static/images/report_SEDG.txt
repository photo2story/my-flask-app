* **EPS:**  EPS has been consistently negative in the reported quarters, with substantial losses in the last two quarters ($-21.13 and $-2.31).  The massive negative EPS in the November 2024 quarter represents a dramatic downturn.  There appears to be a duplicated data entry for 2024-11-07.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial statements paint a picture of a company struggling with profitability and potentially facing liquidity challenges:

* **Revenue and Profitability:** The sharp drop in revenue from Q3 2023 to subsequent quarters is alarming, paired with deeply negative profit margins.  The exceptionally high negative profit margin in Q3 2024 (-269.19%) is a severe outlier and needs further investigation for its potential cause.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative Return on Equity (ROE) indicates the company is not generating returns for its shareholders.  While equity remains relatively high, the consistently negative ROE and declining revenue suggest a concerning trend.

SEDG is currently experiencing significant challenges.  The stock has severely underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting a strong downtrend indicated by its price relative to its moving averages.
