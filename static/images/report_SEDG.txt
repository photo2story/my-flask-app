*   **Expected Return (%):** -1967.7 (Very negative, suggesting poor long-term prospects based on current data)

**Analysis:**

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B  | -128.69%  |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been increasing and the profit margin has improved in recent quarters but the figures were negative in 2024. Equity is decreasing, and the ROE (Return on Equity) is negative and volatile, indicating inefficient use of shareholder equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

SolarEdge (SEDG) is facing significant challenges. While earlier years showed strong growth, recent performance has been very poor, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. The stock is in a clear downtrend, and indicators like RSI and PPO confirm the bearish sentiment.

The negative expected return highlights the risks. While the company shows some improvements in the most recent quarter for revenue and profit margin, the consistent negative earnings, decreasing equity, and negative ROE are major red flags. The analyst ratings are neutral, but the wide target price range indicates uncertainty. The recent news is mixed, offering little clarity.

**In conclusion, based on the provided data, SolarEdge is a high-risk investment with significant headwinds. A very cautious approach is warranted.**
