*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.3 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2217.4

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests high investment recommendation, despite the stock's negative performance. This could indicate that the model sees a high chance of recovery or undervaluation. This may be related to the consensus estimate that the stock is underpriced.

*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being positive may point towards oversold conditions, and that the price is starting to change.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal indicates "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash," this means that the model expects a high chance of recovery.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** A negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days confirms the recent downtrend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is alarming and indicates a very pessimistic outlook for the stock.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

The news headlines present a mixed picture:

*   Several articles discuss the stock "plunging" or trading down (Yahoo Finance, Nov 13 & Nov 3).
*   Some articles highlight potential "winners" and positive aspects of the company (TradingView, Dec 29; Finviz, Dec 22).
*   A fund opened a new position (Quiver Quantitative, Nov 12).
*   One article discusses why the stock was "soaring" on a particular day (Yahoo Finance, Oct 9).

**Analysis:** The news flow suggests a volatile situation with conflicting narratives. The negative headlines likely contributed to the recent decline, while positive news or fund activity provided temporary support. The mention of "soaring" on one specific day highlights the unpredictable nature of the stock currently.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions (Consensus / Targets / Recent Changes):**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 3.30)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 32.65 / 44.00 / 17.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus of "Hold" suggests that analysts, on average, are neutral on the stock's near-term prospects. The average target price ($32.65) is slightly higher than the current price, indicating some potential upside, but the wide range between the high and low targets reflects significant uncertainty. Lack of recent rating changes suggests analysts haven't reacted strongly to recent data, or that they may just be slow to react.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜        | EPS   | 매출       |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-11-06  | -0.84 | 0.34 B$    |
| 2025-08-07  | -2.13 | 0.29 B$    |
| 2025-05-08  | -1.7  | 0.22 B$    |
| 2024-11-07  | -21.13| 0.24 B$    |
| 2025-11-06  | -21.58| 0.24 B$    |

**Analysis:** The earnings data shows consistently negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) and fluctuating revenues. The large negative EPS figures in late 2024 and early 2025 are particularly concerning and likely contributed to the stock's decline. While recent EPS figures are still negative, they are showing signs of improvement, with revenue growing from 0.22B$ to 0.34B$.

**6) Financial Information:**

| 2024-09-30   | $0.96B    | -128.69%   |

**Analysis:** The revenue and profitability data shows a significant turnaround in recent quarters after a drastic decrease in late 2024. Despite the positive profit margin and revenue data, the equity is declining and the Return on Equity (ROE) is negative. This means that the company is facing challenges translating increased sales into profitability for shareholders.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

SolarEdge is currently in a difficult situation. The stock has significantly underperformed the market, driven by negative earnings and poor profitability in recent periods. Recent financial information suggests a potential turnaround, but equity values are declining and there's still negative ROE. The news flow is mixed, and analyst opinions are neutral.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **High Risk:** The negative expected return and recent performance indicate a high-risk investment.
*   **Potential Turnaround:** Recent revenue and profit margin suggest a potential recovery, but it is not reflected in EPS or ROE.
*   **Volatility:** The high MDD and news headlines confirm significant volatility.
*   **Uncertainty:** The wide range in analyst target prices highlights the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future.
*   **Monitor Closely:** Investors should closely monitor future earnings reports and news flow to assess whether the potential turnaround is sustainable.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, a cautious approach is warranted. While there are some signs of a potential turnaround, the risks are substantial. Considering that MRI indicates a high investment opportunity, proceed with caution and monitor future earnings reports and news flow to assess whether the potential turnaround is sustainable. This is a stock best suited for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.
