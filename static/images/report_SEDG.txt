## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG), a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions, has experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) in recent periods. While exhibiting periods of high growth, the company's recent financial performance shows concerning trends.  Further analysis is needed to determine future prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Solaredge Technologies (SEDG) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return difference between SEDG and VOO as of the last data point is a staggering -153.0 percentage points. This means SEDG's return is 153% lower than VOO's return (VOO: 81.83%, SEDG: -71.18%).  The relative divergence (2.0) indicates that this underperformance is near the lower bound of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility and inconsistent performance.  High Beta values (mostly above 1) suggest SEDG is more volatile than the market.  While periods of extremely high CAGR are present, recent years demonstrate massive negative returns.  This underscores the risk associated with this investment.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.56
* **5-day Moving Average:** $12.27
* **20-day Moving Average:** $13.66
* **60-day Moving Average:** $15.23

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  The recent 7.21% increase suggests a short-term upward bounce, but the trend remains bearish.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.66 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.74 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -0.7 (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, >2 years):** 13881.5%  This extremely high expected return needs careful consideration.  It's likely based on assumptions that may not materialize.  The massive underperformance relative to the S&P 500 casts doubt on its reliability.  The sharp price increase of 7.21%  from the previous close should be considered in this analysis. While a sudden jump like this *could* be a positive sign, more data is needed for confirmation; it could simply be a temporary fluctuation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13 | $0.26 B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31  | $0.27 B      |

| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08  | $0.73 B      |

There is a significant and concerning decline in profitability and seemingly duplicate data for November 2024. The large negative EPS figures indicate substantial losses. Revenue is erratic and shows no clear upward trend.

The financial data reveals significant negative profit margins and, in some quarters, extremely high negative ROEs. This indicates serious financial difficulties.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's performance is deeply concerning.  While past periods showed impressive growth, the current trajectory is sharply negative.  The company's recent financial results reveal substantial losses and inconsistent revenue.  The high negative cumulative return compared to the S&P 500 and the negative technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook.  The projected long-term return should be viewed with extreme skepticism given the current financial performance and market trends.  Before considering any investment, thorough due diligence, including examining the reasons behind the recent financial downturn and future growth prospects, is crucial.  The current situation presents substantial risk.
