## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), SEDG has significantly underperformed.  The cumulative return difference between SEDG and VOO as of the last data point is -186.7%, a stark contrast to VOO's 120.42% gain.  This places SEDG's relative performance in the 5th percentile based on historical data's minimum (-192.7%) and maximum (987.3%) ranges.

The provided CAGR data showcases high volatility. While periods of extraordinary growth (e.g., 843% CAGR from 2018-2020) existed, the recent performance (particularly -694% CAGR from 2021-2023 and -619% from 2022-2024) indicates substantial losses.  The high beta values (generally above 1, reaching as high as 18) consistently indicate significant sensitivity to overall market movements.  Alpha values remain consistently low, suggesting limited outperformance relative to the market benchmark (S&P 500).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $14.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $16.12

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, it remains below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.84 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.93 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** 0.0 (-), indicating a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0%  This indicates that, based on the provided data, no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term.  This assessment likely needs significant adjustments considering the company's extreme volatility and high risk profile.

The current price ($14.37) is not exceptionally high or low given the recent trends;  no signs of extreme price jumps (급반등/급하락) are evident from the supplied data.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent quarterly results show a significant deterioration in profitability. Revenue has generally declined (with the exception of a high in 2023 Q3), and the company has consistently reported net losses. The most recent quarter (2024 Q3) shows a massive negative profit margin (-269.19%), indicating substantial losses relative to revenue.  This sharp decline is significantly worse than previous quarters' negative profit margins.  A notable issue is that the 2024 Q3 and 2024 Q4 reports are identical.  This strongly suggests a potential data reporting error and warrants further investigation.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data confirms a significant downturn in the company's performance.  Revenue has fallen substantially from Q3 2023, to Q4 2024. While equity remains relatively high, the ROE consistently shows large negative values. The extremely negative profit margin in 2024 Q3 is particularly alarming and needs clarification given the identically reported Q4 2024 figures.  The negative ROE suggests that the company is not generating returns on its equity investment.  This requires more detailed analysis than can be performed from the provided data alone.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information is provided on recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions. This is crucial information to incorporate into a complete investment assessment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG shows considerable risk. While past periods of exceptional growth are evident, the recent financial performance, reflected in significant negative CAGRs, substantially negative profit margins, and a consistently negative ROE, paints a concerning picture.  The extremely high beta highlights the company’s sensitivity to market volatility. The lack of positive alpha signals limited outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  The missing or inaccurate earnings data raises serious concerns about data reliability.  Any investment decision must account for this exceptionally high-risk profile and the need for further investigation into the reported financials. The absence of recent news and analyst opinions significantly limits the comprehensiveness of this analysis.  Further due diligence is absolutely necessary before considering an investment.


**8. Recommendation:**

Given the substantial negative performance, volatile price movements,  significantly negative financial metrics, and missing/erroneous data points, a **strong caution** is advised before investing in SEDG.  More information is needed from dependable sources to assess the validity of the data and form a more informed investment strategy.  The high risk involved necessitates thorough research and careful consideration of your risk tolerance.
