This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but further price action is needed to confirm a sustained reversal. The recent price increase (2.13%) indicates a potential issue, possibly a short-term rebound or reaction to news.

*   **Expected Return:** 11615.8% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Indicates a relatively low level of market risk, which might be misleading given the company-specific challenges.
*   **RSI:**  A value of 35.96 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:**  A negative PPO (-2.21) suggests the stock is in a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal is advising caution, recommending holding a significant cash position (70%) and selling a small portion of holdings, based on the low MRI.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** This indicates a short-term uptick relative to the S&P 500, but the overall divergence remains very negative.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return (11615.8%) should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  It likely reflects a statistical anomaly or a model that is overestimating potential recovery based on the current depressed price.

**Analysis:** The financial data paints a concerning picture. While revenue has fluctuated, the profit margins are consistently negative, and dramatically so in some quarters. This suggests serious issues with cost control or pricing. The Equity has been declining sharply. The negative ROE further confirms the company is not generating profits from its equity.
