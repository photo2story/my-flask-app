## Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.  This report analyzes SEDG's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and evaluating its financial health and future prospects.  The analysis indicates significant underperformance compared to the market, coupled with concerning recent financial results.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SEDG's cumulative return of -68.8% significantly underperforms the S&P 500's return of 119.5%.  The divergence (-188.3) places it at the 4th percentile of its historical range (relative divergence of 0.4).

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals high volatility and inconsistent performance. While exhibiting periods of exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate),  the recent years (2021-2025) show drastically negative CAGRs and high maximum drawdowns (MDDs). The increasing Beta suggests a heightened sensitivity to market movements, especially in recent periods.  This high Beta, coupled with negative returns, showcases substantial risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.10
* **5-day Moving Average:** $13.38
* **20-day Moving Average:** $14.34
* **60-day Moving Average:** $13.91

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop of approximately 1.6% from the previous close further reinforces this observation.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (36.7):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so.
* **PPO (-1.04):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Divergence (-0.1):**  Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (38594.1%):** This extremely high figure requires further investigation and context to be meaningful.  Such high percentage returns over a two-year period would be highly unlikely and raise significant questions about the calculation methodology. The calculation needs scrutiny before any reliance on this figure.

The sharp recent price drop (-1.6%) reflects negative market sentiment and the overall negative trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals significant losses in recent quarters. Revenue has been relatively stable, but the consistent negative EPS is a major concern. There's also a discrepancy in the data provided, with the 2024-11-07 data appearing twice.  This needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13  | $0.26B        |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31   | $0.27B        |
| 2024-05-09 | -2.75   | $0.20B        |
| 2023-11-06 | -1.08   | $0.73B        |
| 2024-11-07 | -1.08   | $0.73B        |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data highlights significant profitability issues.  The extremely negative profit margins in Q3 and Q4 2024 are alarming, indicating serious operational challenges.  Similarly, the negative Return on Equity (ROE) throughout the period, reaching -126% in Q3 2024, demonstrates substantial concerns about shareholder value.  The significant drop in equity from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 requires further investigation.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.26B  | -269.19%      |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.27B  | -4.13%        |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG is currently experiencing significant challenges.  Its substantial underperformance against the S&P 500, coupled with alarming negative profit margins and ROE, points to a concerning financial situation.  The high Beta indicates heightened market risk. While the RSI suggests a potential oversold condition,  the negative PPO and recent price action suggest a continuation of the downtrend is more likely.  The extraordinarily high projected long-term return needs thorough validation.  Further investigation into the discrepancies within the provided data and a comprehensive analysis of the company's operational and strategic issues are necessary before forming any investment decision.  Caution is strongly advised.
