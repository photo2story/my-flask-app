**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜        | EPS    | 매출      |
| :---------- | :----- | :-------- |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.84  | 0.34 B$   |

**Analysis:** SolarEdge's recent earnings have been consistently negative, with large EPS losses. While revenue has fluctuated, it hasn't been enough to offset the losses.  The repeating date `2025-11-06` with different EPS values needs to be investigated for data accuracy. The drastic drop in EPS from 2024-11-07 (-21.13) to the most recent quarters indicates a significant deterioration in profitability.
