From 2018-2022, the company had very high CAGR and alpha values, but performance has significantly deteriorated in recent years (2021-2025).

*   **Previous Close:** 36.42

*   **60-day Moving Average:** 36.24

*   **Analysis:**  The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The price is hovering right around the 60-day moving average. The small negative price change suggests a limited impact on the day.

**3. Technical Indicators & Signals**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 44.82 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 1.3 (+) (Short-term increase)

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is neutral. The PPO is slightly bearish. The Hybrid Signal suggests a "Buy" recommendation. The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term uptick in performance compared to the S&P 500, but this needs to be viewed in the context of its overall underperformance.
