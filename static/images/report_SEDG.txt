| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 82.0%    | 15.0%    | 56.0% | 0.1   | 2.2   |
| 2016-2018  | 32.0%    | 20.6%    | 14.0% | -0.2  | 2.0   |
| 2017-2019  | 289.0%   | 20.6%    | 258.0% | 0.3   | 5.5   |
| 2018-2020  | 843.0%   | 34.1%    | 816.0% | 0.1   | 18.5  |
| 2019-2021  | 597.0%   | 34.1%    | 526.0% | 0.1   | 16.3  |
| 2020-2022  | 342.0%   | 34.1%    | 334.0% | 0.1   | 16.4  |
| 2021-2023  | -694.0%  | 41.2%    | -718.0% | 0.8   | 5.4   |
| 2022-2024  | -621.0%  | 48.0%    | -654.0% | 0.8   | 0.8   |
| 2023-2025  | -744.0%  | 48.0%    | -806.0% | 1.1   | 0.9   |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $14.85
* **5-day Moving Average:** $14.00
* **20-day Moving Average:** $13.82
* **60-day Moving Average:** $13.83

The price is above the 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend.  However, the significant price drop leading up to this point must be considered. The last market data shows a significant daily price increase of 11.74%.  This warrants further investigation into the cause of this sharp price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 51.22 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.48 (Slightly positive; suggesting a potential upward trend)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.1 (Short-term downward trend)

The relatively high expected return of 37492% should be treated with extreme caution.  This figure is unrealistic and likely results from flawed calculations or an inappropriate model, especially considering the current negative performance and financial indicators.  The sharp price increase needs to be investigated further for underlying causes.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13 | $0.26B        |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31  | $0.27B        |
| 2024-05-09 | -$2.75  | $0.20B        |
| 2023-11-06 | -$1.08  | $0.73B        |
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08  | $0.73B        |

The recent earnings show consistently negative EPS,  with a significant deterioration in the last quarter (2024-11-07). Revenue is inconsistent, showing both decreases and increases between quarters. This raises major concerns about the company's profitability and financial stability. There seems to be a duplication of the data for the 2024-11-07 entry.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B       | -269.19%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27B       | -4.13%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.20B       | -12.81%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.32B       | -17.85%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.73B       | 19.69%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity       | ROE           |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B       | -126.03%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B       | -6.21%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.24B       | -7.02%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.41B       | -6.73%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.49B       | -2.46%        |

The financial data reveals significant issues. Negative profit margins, particularly the extraordinarily large negative margin in Q3 2024 (-269.19%), and negative ROE indicate severe financial distress.  Revenue volatility compounds these concerns.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG is experiencing significant challenges.  While the recent price increase and positive short-term technical indicators might suggest a short-term recovery, the underlying financial performance is extremely weak.  The consistently negative EPS and profit margins, coupled with the substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, paint a concerning picture.  The extremely high expected return is unreliable and should be disregarded.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the recent price jump and the overall financial decline.  A long-term investment in SEDG at this time carries substantial risk.  Thorough due diligence is crucial before any investment decision.  Considering the current financial state, it's advisable to exercise extreme caution and possibly reconsider investment in SEDG.
