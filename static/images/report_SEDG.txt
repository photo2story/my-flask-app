*   The Alpha and Beta analysis show a significant deterioration in performance in recent years (2021-2025). Alpha is strongly negative, indicating underperformance relative to the market.  Beta is trending upwards, suggesting increased correlation (and sensitivity) to market movements, but in a negative way. CAGR is also increasingly negative.  This suggests SEDG is underperforming, and its stock price is more sensitive to market downturns.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** $28.97
*   **Recent Close:** $29.49 (Change: -1.76): This suggests a minor recent downward movement.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day MA: $30.27
    *   20-day MA: $32.05
    *   60-day MA: $27.15

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it's slightly above the 60-day moving average.
*   The recent price drop of -1.76 reinforces this short-term negative trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Hybrid Signal**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3233 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 26.93 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -2.45 (Negative Momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_60%_Sell 59.9% of holdings (895 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 60% on 2025-09-09)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -1.2 (Negative - Short Term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 13726.2% (Long-Term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI indicates that the stock may be oversold, potentially signaling a possible short-term rebound.
*   The negative PPO suggests negative momentum in the medium term.
*   The hybrid signal recommends selling a significant portion of holdings and increasing cash position, indicating a cautious outlook.
*   The "recent divergence change" confirms a short-term negative trend.
*   The high expected return figure is interesting, and should be treated with caution. This likely assumes the stock will recover from its current depressed state. Given the recent trends, this might be overly optimistic.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Headlines:**  Most recent news articles indicate negative sentiment and concerns about SEDG's performance ("SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) Sees a More Significant Dip Than Broader Market," "Why SolarEdge (SEDG) Shares Are Plunging Today").
*   **Analyst Downgrades/Price Target Cuts:** Guggenheim's action of raising the price target to $7 while maintaining a "Sell" rating is very concerning. This suggests they foresee further downside but a limited potential upside.

**Analysis:**

*   The news flow is overwhelmingly negative, which likely contributes to the stock's poor performance.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 3.45)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: $22.78, High: $41.00, Low: $7.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not specified, but given the overall sentiment, potential downgrades should be investigated.

**Analysis:**

*   The "Hold" consensus is misleading. The significant gap between the high and low target prices ($7 vs $41) indicates considerable uncertainty and disagreement among analysts. The average target price of $22.78 is *below* the current price, suggesting analysts, on average, expect further price declines.

| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B   | -6.21%   |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue is volatile. Profit margins have been severely negative in recent quarters (especially Q3 and Q4 2024).
*   Equity has been declining significantly.
*   ROE is deeply negative, reflecting the company's inability to generate profits on shareholder equity.

**7. Overall Assessment and Recommendation**

SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) is currently facing significant challenges.

*   **Negative Performance:** It is substantially underperforming the S&P 500.
*   **Financial Deterioration:**  Earnings, revenue, profit margins, and ROE have all deteriorated. Equity is decreasing.
*   **Negative Sentiment:** News headlines and analyst opinions are predominantly negative.
*   **Technical Signals:** While RSI suggests a potential oversold bounce, the overall technical picture is weak.

**Recommendation:**

Given the negative trends, financial performance, and market sentiment, a **"Sell"** or at least a **"Strong Underweight"** rating is warranted.  The high "expected return" should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  The company needs to demonstrate a clear path to profitability and reverse the negative trends in its financials.  Until then, significant caution is advised. The hybrid signal recommending a 60% cash position seems prudent.  Further, the very wide range of analyst price targets is evidence of significant uncertainty about the company's future prospects.
