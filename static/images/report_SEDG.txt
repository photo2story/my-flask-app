*   **Recent Struggles:** Since 2021, the company's performance has deteriorated dramatically. CAGR and Alpha have become significantly negative, indicating substantial underperformance.
*   **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** Consistently high MDD values indicate significant volatility and risk.

**Analysis:**

The current price is below all the SMAs, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is the closest to the current price, while the 20-day SMA is the highest, reinforcing this downtrend. The positive change from previous close may indicate a very short term upward momentum.

*   **RSI:** 19.67 (Oversold)

*   **Expected Return (%):** -1025.7% (Long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The high MRI score suggests, according to this metric, a relatively safe investment.
*   **RSI:** The extremely low RSI indicates that the stock is heavily oversold, potentially suggesting a possible reversal.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO value reinforces the downtrend indicated by the SMA analysis.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** A buy signal with 0% cash allocation is based on the MRI, but this should be viewed with caution given other indicators.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Confirms the recent downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a MAJOR red flag, indicating significant projected losses if held long-term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative News:** Recent headlines focus on a significant stock decline (9.9%) due to an approaching tax credit deadline. This likely contributes to the recent downward price movement and negative sentiment.
*   **Fund Activity:** Handelsbanken Fonder AB opened a new position, but this seems to be outweighed by negative factors and overall price decline.
*   **Price-Sensitive Allocations:** Indication from news outlet related to potential role of price-sensitive allocations.

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Recent news headlines highlight concerns about tax credit deadlines and stock declines.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Technical indicators such as RSI point to the stock being oversold, but a high MRI should be viewed with skepticism. SMA and PPO show a strong down trend.

*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major warning sign.

**Conclusion:**

While the oversold RSI might suggest a potential short-term bounce, the overall picture is concerning. The negative financial performance, negative news flow, and significantly negative expected return indicate that this stock carries substantial risk. Investment is NOT recommended at this time without a clear turnaround strategy and evidence of improved financial performance.
