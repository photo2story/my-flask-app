## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Stock Analysis Report 

**1.  Performance vs. S&P 500** 

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG), a leading provider of solar energy solutions, has outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative returns. SEDG has a cumulative return of 189.13% while VOO has a cumulative return of 132.85%. This results in a 56.28% difference in returns. Although this indicates SEDG’s superior performance, it's important to note that the relative divergence is at the 9.72 percentile, meaning it’s above the average performance but not significantly extraordinary compared to historical performance.

**Analyzing the Alpha and Beta Table:**

* SEDG exhibits high volatility with a beta ranging from 0.6 to 2.3, suggesting a greater sensitivity to market movements than the S&P 500. 
* The company experienced periods of significant outperformance (alpha > 100%) in 2017, 2019, and 2020, showing its ability to generate strong returns exceeding market expectations. 
* However, periods of underperformance are also evident, with negative alpha and substantial maximum drawdowns (MDD) in 2016, 2021, 2023, and 2024. 

This suggests that SEDG offers potential for significant gains but also carries higher risk due to its cyclical nature and dependence on factors such as solar energy industry trends and economic conditions.

**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **Closing Price:** 18.87 (Last-market: 14.99)
* **5-day Moving Average:** 17.76
* **20-day Moving Average:** 17.57
* **60-day Moving Average:** 20.74

The recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, as the closing price is below all three moving averages. The 5-day moving average is slightly above the 20-day moving average, indicating a potential for a short-term bounce. However, the significant gap between the 60-day moving average and the current price suggests a longer-term downtrend.  The last market price of 14.99 implies a recent jump, indicating a potential short-term bullish move.

**3. Technical Indicators**

* **RSI:** 51.49 - This suggests that SEDG is neither overbought nor oversold.  
* **PPO:** 1.87 - This indicates a bullish momentum, as the PPO is above zero.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.24 (-) - This suggests a short-term downtrend, as the relative divergence has declined over the last 20 days.
* **Expected Return:** 0.6% - This represents a modest expected return, suggesting potential for long-term growth but with limited outperformance compared to the S&P 500.
