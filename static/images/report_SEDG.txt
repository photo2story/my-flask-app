*   **Alpha:** The negative alpha in recent periods indicates that SEDG has underperformed relative to its risk (Beta).
*   **Beta:** A Beta consistently above 1 suggests SEDG's price is more volatile than the market.  The recent increase in Beta indicates even higher volatility.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures across all periods point to significant risk and price volatility.
*   **Capitalization:** Market capitalization has decreased sharply, indicating a loss of investor confidence.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 28.85
*   **Previous Close:** 29.02

*   **5-day SMA:** 29.65
*   **20-day SMA:** 30.049
*   **60-day SMA:** 34.6947

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all its Simple Moving Averages (SMA), indicating a downtrend. The relatively small change from the previous close doesn't negate the longer-term downward trend.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 37.58

*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the recent poor performance, the MRI suggests a *high* investment recommendation. This might be a contrarian signal or reflect an expectation of future improvement that isn't yet reflected in the price.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 37.58 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), suggesting a potential for a rebound.
*   **PPO:** The PPO value is positive, implying that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests buying, potentially due to the perceived safety based on the high MRI.
*   **Divergence Change:** A positive change in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The expected return of 0.0% is concerning, indicating no anticipated excess return compared to the S&P 500 in the long term.
