| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 82.0%    | 15.0%    | 56.0% | 0.1   | 2.2   |

| 2018-2020  | 843.0%   | 34.1%    | 816.0%| 0.1   | 18.8  |
| 2019-2021  | 597.0%   | 34.1%    | 526.0%| 0.1   | 16.6  |

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.10
* **Last Market Price:** $13.35
* **5-day Moving Average:** $13.38
* **20-day Moving Average:** $14.34
* **60-day Moving Average:** $13.91

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent slight increase in price from the previous close ($13.1 to $13.35) is minimal compared to the overall downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (36.74):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, but not necessarily a strong buy signal on its own.
* **PPO (-1.04):** Suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-0.1):** Shows a recent short-term weakening in price relative to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (38594.1%):** This exceptionally high expected return should be treated with extreme caution.  It likely reflects an overly optimistic projection based on the historical volatility and current low price, not a realistic forecast.  The methodology for this calculation needs to be carefully examined.  


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant losses in recent quarters. Revenue has also declined.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13  | $0.26B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31   | $0.27B      |
| 2024-05-09 | -$2.75   | $0.20B      |
| 2023-11-06 | -$1.08   | $0.73B      |
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08   | $0.73B      |

* **Analysis:**  The dramatic decrease in EPS in the most recent quarter (2024-11-07) is extremely concerning.  Revenue is also inconsistent and significantly down. This indicates serious financial trouble for the company.  The duplication of the 2023-11-06 data in the 2024-11-07 row needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information further highlights the company's profitability problems.  Negative profit margins and ROE are very worrying.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B   | -269.19%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27B   | -4.13%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.20B   | -12.81%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.32B   | -17.85%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.73B   | 19.69%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE          |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B   | -126.03%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B   | -6.21%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.24B   | -7.02%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.41B   | -6.73%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.49B   | -2.46%       |


* **Analysis:** The extremely negative profit margin in Q3 2024 is a major red flag.  The negative ROE across multiple quarters shows the company is not generating returns on its equity.  The volatility in equity values is also troubling.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG is currently experiencing significant financial distress, with substantial losses and declining revenue.  The stock's price has underperformed the S&P 500 dramatically, and technical indicators suggest further downward pressure. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative earnings, negative profit margins, and negative ROE raise serious concerns about the company's long-term viability.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return is likely unrealistic.  Investors should exercise extreme caution and thoroughly investigate the company's situation before considering any investment.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons for the significant losses and the reliability of the provided expected return figure.  Considering the provided data, a long-term investment in SEDG appears highly risky.
