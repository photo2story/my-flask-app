Over the analyzed period, SEDG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a cumulative return of -60.04% compared to VOO's 115.74%.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and inconsistent performance. While exhibiting periods of strong growth (e.g., 2017-2020),  the recent years (2021-2025) have experienced dramatic declines, marked by negative CAGR and substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  The increasing Beta values suggest increasing market sensitivity and risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $16.49
* **Last Market Price:** $14.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $18.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $15.915
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $14.7525

The recent price movement shows a sharp decline, with the last market price significantly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The price is slightly above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support at that level.  The large price drop from previous close highlights a significant negative event.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.68 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.72 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 25668.3% (This extremely high number requires careful scrutiny; it likely reflects a high degree of uncertainty and potential for significant error). The massive expected return needs to be viewed with extreme caution.  It is highly improbable.  Further clarification on the methodology used to calculate this figure is necessary. The sharp recent price drop casts significant doubt on such a high projected return.

The large negative change in the last market price (-10.24%) indicates a significant negative market event affecting SEDG. This warrants further investigation into the underlying cause.

The financial statements reveal severe profitability issues, with consistently negative profit margins and a sharply declining ROE in recent quarters.  Revenue is also showing signs of contraction.  This paints a concerning picture of the company's financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG has experienced a dramatic downturn, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Financial statements highlight serious concerns regarding profitability and revenue generation. Recent earnings show substantial losses, and technical indicators, while not definitively bearish, don't offer much optimism. The extremely high projected long-term return should be treated with extreme skepticism given the current financial state.  The projected return is highly unrealistic and unreliable.  Further investigation into the underlying causes of the recent price drop and financial difficulties is crucial before considering any investment in SEDG.  Currently, the data points towards a highly risky investment.
