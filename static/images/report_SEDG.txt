**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 72.0%   | 15.0%  | -0.1  | 2.2   |        |
| 2016-2018  | 10.0%   | 20.4%  | -0.1  | 2.1   |        |
| 2017-2019  | 235.0%  | 20.4%  | 0.2   | 5.7   |        |
| 2018-2020  | 793.0%  | 66.8%  | 0.1   | 19.1  |        |
| 2019-2021  | 582.0%  | 66.8%  | 0.1   | 16.8  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 317.0%  | 66.8%  | 0.1   | 16.9  |        |
| 2021-2023  | -666.0% | 57.9%  | 0.7   | 5.6   |        |
| 2022-2024  | -589.0% | 62.3%  | 0.7   | 0.8   |        |
| 2023-2025  | -656.0% | 71.9%  | 0.9   | 1.0   |        |


The high beta values (especially 2018-2022)  indicate high sensitivity to market movements.  The fluctuating alpha suggests inconsistent outperformance relative to the market. The drastic negative CAGR in the most recent periods is concerning.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $16.68
* **Last Market Price:** $16.95 (Slight increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $16.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $16.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.58

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average. This suggests some short-term upward momentum, but a longer-term trend that remains uncertain.  The recent price increase of 1.59% indicated a minor positive movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Low to Medium Risk) â€“ suggests relatively low market risk.
* **RSI:** 56.80 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.59 (Negative, indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 14964.5% (This exceptionally high figure needs further clarification and likely contains errors;  raw data may be misrepresented.)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture.  The MRI suggests low risk, but the negative PPO and a slight positive RSI hint at cautious optimism. The reported expected return needs to be validated.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS       | Revenue       |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13   | $0.26 B       |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31    | $0.27 B       |
| 2024-05-09 | -$2.75    | $0.20 B       |
| 2023-11-06 | -$1.08    | $0.73 B       |
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08    | $0.73 B       |


The most recent earnings show significant losses, especially in the November 2024 quarter.  There's an apparent duplication of data in the table.  Revenue is also quite volatile.  This negative earnings trend clearly reflects the significant stock price decline.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17 B    | -80.66%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26 B    | -269.19%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27 B    | -4.13%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.20 B    | -12.81%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.32 B    | -17.85%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE           |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.66 B    | -47.53%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96 B    | -126.03%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11 B    | -6.21%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.24 B    | -7.02%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.41 B    | -6.73%        |

The financial statements reveal significant losses and negative profit margins in recent quarters. The ROE is also substantially negative, indicating poor profitability.  This financial weakness strongly supports the observed stock price decline.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  Negative earnings, high volatility, and negative profit margins paint a concerning picture.  While the short-term price movement shows slight positive momentum, the underlying financial health and the substantially negative longer-term CAGR strongly suggest a bearish outlook.  The extremely high "Expected Return" needs to be critically reviewed and validated as it appears unrealistic.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent dramatic decline in revenue and profits is crucial for a complete analysis.  Investors should exercise caution.  Any investment decision should be based on thorough due diligence and a consideration of the significant risks involved.
