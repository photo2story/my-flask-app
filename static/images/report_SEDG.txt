## Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power inverters and related technologies.  Over the period analyzed, SEDG's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is a staggering -182.2%, representing a substantial underperformance.  The relative divergence of -0.9 indicates that SEDG's performance falls at the extremely low end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. While past CAGR figures show impressive growth in certain periods, the recent -700%+ CAGR highlights significant underperformance against the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $14.21
* **5-day Moving Average:** $14.43
* **20-day Moving Average:** $14.62
* **60-day Moving Average:** $14.43

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day and 60-day moving averages indicates some consolidation or potential support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.62 (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting a slightly bearish sentiment but not decisively oversold.)
* **PPO:** -0.46 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (Indicates a recent period of underperformance relative to the S&P 500.)
* **Expected Return:** 39365.4% (This exceptionally high figure requires further investigation.  It's crucial to understand the methodology and assumptions used to arrive at this estimate.  A drastically high number like this should be treated with extreme caution. It’s likely this refers to a scenario that’s highly unlikely to be realised.)

The current price of $14.21 doesn't indicate any extreme price movement (e.g., a sharp spike or drop) based on the provided data alone.  The combination of the technical indicators points towards a bearish outlook in the short term.  The expected return needs clarification regarding its calculation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a troubling trend:

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue      | Notes                                  |
|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13   | $0.26B       | Significant loss; Potentially Duplicate Entry |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31    | $0.27B       | Loss                                   |
| 2024-05-09 | -$2.75    | $0.20B       | Loss                                   |
| 2023-11-06 | -$1.08    | $0.73B       | Loss                                   |
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08    | $0.73B       | Loss; Potentially Duplicate Entry      |


There appears to be duplicate data entries for November 2024.  The significant losses in recent quarters, particularly the massive -$21.13 EPS in November 2024, are extremely concerning and warrant thorough investigation into the underlying reasons. Revenue has also dropped significantly.


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals severe profitability issues:

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B  | -269.19%     | Extremely High Loss                    |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27B  | -4.13%       | Loss                                   |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.20B  | -12.81%      | Loss                                   |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.32B  | -17.85%      | Loss                                   |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.73B  | 19.69%       | Profit                                  |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE          |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B  | -126.03%     | Extremely High Loss                    |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B  | -6.21%       | Loss                                   |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.24B  | -7.02%       | Loss                                   |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.41B  | -6.73%       | Loss                                   |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.49B  | -2.46%       | Loss                                   |

The significant negative profit margins and ROE figures in recent quarters paint a dire picture of the company's financial health.  The exceptionally high negative profit margin in Q3 2024 (-269.19%) warrants careful scrutiny.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's performance is alarming.  The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, coupled with sharply negative earnings, plummeting profit margins, and concerning ROE figures, paints a highly bearish picture.  The exceptionally high negative numbers suggest potential reporting errors or extraordinary circumstances that require further investigation.  The current price may reflect a market that is fully aware of these problems.  Before considering any investment, a thorough analysis of the factors driving the recent poor performance is essential.  Considering the highly negative financial situation, a long-term investment in SEDG, even with dollar-cost averaging, carries significant risks.
