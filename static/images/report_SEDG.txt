**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. is a provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.  SEDG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return of -63.48% compared to VOO's 108.56%. The large negative divergence (-172%) highlights this underperformance.  The provided alpha and beta values show high volatility and significant market sensitivity (high beta), particularly in recent years.  While exhibiting periods of high growth (e.g., 2017-2021), the recent negative CAGR values indicate a sharp downturn in performance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 82.0%    | 15.0%    | 0.1   | 2.2   |        |
| 2016-2018  | 32.0%    | 20.6%    | -0.2  | 2.1   |        |
| 2017-2019  | 289.0%   | 20.6%    | 0.3   | 5.6   |        |
| 2018-2020  | 843.0%   | 34.1%    | 0.1   | 18.8  |        |
| 2019-2021  | 597.0%   | 34.1%    | 0.1   | 16.5  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 342.0%   | 34.1%    | 0.1   | 16.6  |        |
| 2021-2023  | -694.0%  | 41.2%    | 0.8   | 5.5   |        |
| 2022-2024  | -621.0%  | 48.0%    | 0.8   | 0.8   |        |
| 2023-2025  | -743.0%  | 48.0%    | 1.1   | 0.9   |        |

The dramatic shift in CAGR and Beta from 2021 onwards requires detailed investigation. The substantial increase in Alpha in the last three years suggests the stock has significantly underperformed compared to what its beta would predict.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($14.84) is below both the 5-day ($16.38) and 20-day ($16.04) moving averages, indicating a downward trend in the short term.  However, it's slightly above the 60-day moving average ($14.73), suggesting potential support at this level.  The recent 5% price increase might signal a temporary rebound from a longer-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 54.96 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The negative PPO (-1.74) indicates bearish momentum.  The negative change in relative divergence (-0.1) confirms a recent short-term downward trend.  The extremely high expected return (19720.4%) is highly improbable and needs clarification on the assumptions and methodology used for this calculation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13   | $0.26B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31    | $0.27B      |
| 2024-05-09 | -2.75    | $0.20B      |
| 2023-11-06 | -1.08    | $0.73B      |
| 2024-11-07 | -1.08    | $0.73B      |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-07.  The data shows significant losses (negative EPS) and a considerable decline in revenue in the last few quarters, especially in Q4 2024. This strongly supports the negative performance observed in the stock price.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B     | -80.66%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B     | -269.19%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27B     | -4.13%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.20B     | -12.81%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.32B     | -17.85%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE          |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.66B     | -47.53%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B     | -126.03%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B     | -6.21%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.24B     | -7.02%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.41B     | -6.73%       |

The financial data reveals significant losses and negative profit margins in recent quarters, further explaining the stock's poor performance.  The volatility in equity and ROE also points to financial instability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG has experienced a substantial decline in performance, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Negative earnings, declining revenue, and negative profit margins paint a bleak picture of the company's current financial health. The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity, amplifying both gains and losses.  While past periods show impressive growth, the current trend is decisively negative.  The highly questionable projected long-term return necessitates further investigation into its calculation.  Before considering any investment, a thorough review of the company's strategic initiatives and long-term prospects is essential.  The data suggests significant risk associated with SEDG at present.
