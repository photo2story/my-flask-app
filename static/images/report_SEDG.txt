### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** \$36.24
*   **Previous Close:** \$37.96
*   **Change:** -4.53%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** \$37.27
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** \$34.75
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** \$30.74

**Analysis:** The price decrease of -4.53% and the current price being below the 5-day moving average suggests short-term downward momentum. The 20-day moving average is above the 60-day moving average, which *could* indicate a possible longer-term upward trend. However, the recent price drop warrants caution.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Hybrid Signal

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 63.14 (Neutral to slightly overbought)
*   **PPO:** -0.23 (Slightly Bearish)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash 0%, Buy 100% of cash (26 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment (\$1,000.00)
*   **Expected Return:** 1527.3% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500, if dollar-cost averaging)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.9 suggests a generally favorable investment environment based on broader market conditions.
*   **RSI:** The RSI indicates the stock is neither significantly overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO value indicates the stock's price is trending slightly downward relative to its moving averages.
*   **Relative Divergence:** The negative change in relative divergence aligns with the recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying the stock with all available cash, suggesting that the current price is a good entry point despite the recent struggles. This is coupled with a recommendation for dollar-cost averaging.
*   **Expected Return:**  The very high expected return should be viewed with caution. It represents a potential long-term outlook *if* SEDG can recover and outperform the S&P 500 significantly. Given recent performance, this is a highly optimistic projection.
*   **Change:** A significant price drop of -4.53% reflects a volatile issue that has to be reflected in the analysis.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Negative News:** The recent news headlines primarily focus on the stock trading down, falling amid market upticks, and being flagged as an unprofitable stock. This suggests current market sentiment is negative.
*   **Price Target Adjustment:** Deutsche Bank adjusted the price target *down* to \$28 from \$19, maintaining a "Hold" rating. This downward revision reflects concern.
*   **Potential Value:** One article suggests the stock is trading at a discount, but this should be considered alongside the other negative news.

### 4-2. Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean rating: 3.45)
*   **Target Price:** Average: \$23.94, High: \$41.00, Low: \$7.00
*   **Rating Changes:** No specific rating changes were listed, but the overall consensus leans towards "Hold."

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus of "Hold" reflects uncertainty. The wide range in target prices (from \$7 to \$41) indicates significant disagreement among analysts about the stock's future potential. The average target price is significantly *below* the current price.

### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-08-07 | -2.13  | 0.29 B\$   |
| 2025-05-08 | -1.7   | 0.22 B\$   |
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13 | 0.26 B\$   |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31  | 0.27 B\$   |
| 2025-08-07 | -2.31  | 0.27 B\$   |

**Analysis:** The EPS (Earnings Per Share) is consistently negative, indicating the company is currently unprofitable. Revenue has fluctuated, but not enough to offset the losses. The large negative EPS in 2024-11-07 is a significant concern. The double-listing of `2025-08-07` seems like a data error.
