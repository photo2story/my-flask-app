**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR shows a highly volatile performance.  While there were periods of substantial growth (2017-2021), recent periods (2021-2025) show significant negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD indicates significant risk, with drawdowns ranging from 65.9% to 86.7% in several periods. This suggests considerable downside volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing excess return relative to the market, is largely negative in recent years, confirming underperformance. The high positive alpha values in previous years couldn't offset recent negative values.
*   **Beta:** Beta, measuring volatility relative to the market, has increased in recent years (0.6 to 0.9), suggesting that SEDG's price movements are becoming more correlated with and more sensitive to overall market movements.  The recent high beta values suggest that SEDG's downside is being amplified.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has decreased from 16.7B to 1.4B recently, reflecting the poor performance.

*   **20-day Moving Average:** 26.6497
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 22.2675

**Analysis:**

The current price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, the price is above the 60-day moving average, which might indicate some longer-term support. The significant price change of -5.31% in the last trading session suggests strong negative momentum and potentially increased volatility.

*   **Expected Return:** 8049.6% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A low MRI suggests relatively low market risk currently, which is a positive sign.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 42.92 is near neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends a high cash position (69%) and suggests selling a small portion of holdings, indicating a cautious outlook.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** The recent positive change in relative disparity suggests a potential short-term upward movement.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (8049.6%) is likely an anomaly or a result of the calculation method given the recent performance and should be viewed with extreme skepticism. This could be based on a mean reversion assumption that may not hold true.
