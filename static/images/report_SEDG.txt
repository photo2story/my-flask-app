**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. is a provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.  The cumulative return of SEDG (-58.53%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which showed a 108.19% return.  The difference of -166.7% highlights a substantial underperformance.  The provided relative divergence measure suggests that this underperformance, while significant, is not unprecedented in the historical context of the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show high volatility and significant shifts in the company's beta (market risk exposure) over time.  High beta values (especially in 2018-2021) suggest high sensitivity to market movements, while the negative CAGR and highly negative alpha in the last three years indicate significant underperformance relative to the market. The recent decrease in beta suggests a reduced sensitivity to market movements, though it's still very low. This volatility could be a result of factors specific to the solar energy sector.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 82.0% | 15.0% | 56.0% | 0.1 | 2.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 32.0% | 20.6% | 14.0% | -0.2 | 2.1 |
| 2017-2019  | 289.0% | 20.6% | 258.0% | 0.3 | 5.6 |
| 2018-2020  | 843.0% | 34.1% | 816.0% | 0.1 | 18.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 597.0% | 34.1% | 526.0% | 0.1 | 16.5 |
| 2020-2022  | 342.0% | 34.1% | 334.0% | 0.1 | 16.6 |
| 2021-2023  | -694.0% | 41.2% | -718.0% | 0.8 | 5.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -621.0% | 48.0% | -654.0% | 0.8 | 0.8 |

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $16.85
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $15.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $16.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $14.88

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum, but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a longer-term downtrend. The recent 5.18% price increase indicates a significant short-term rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.79 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.31 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 15885.5% (This extremely high figure needs further clarification and justification. It's likely unrealistic without further details on the calculation methodology.)

The recent price surge (5.18%) might be a temporary bounce. The negative PPO reinforces the bearish momentum, despite the positive relative divergence.  The extremely high expected return requires additional context and validation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue    |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13   | $0.26B     |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31    | $0.27B     |
| 2024-05-09 | -$2.75    | $0.20B     |
| 2023-11-06 | -$1.08    | $0.73B     |
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08    | $0.73B     |

There's a significant discrepancy in the November 2024 data.  The dramatic drop in EPS in November 2024 is concerning and requires further investigation. Revenue has also fluctuated significantly, indicating operational instability. The negative EPS across all reported quarters demonstrates substantial losses.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG has severely underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  The company's financial health is troubling, showing significant losses and negative profit margins. While recent price action shows a short-term rebound, the underlying fundamentals suggest caution. The high volatility and negative alpha signal significant risk.  Before considering any investment, a thorough investigation into the reasons behind the substantial losses and the extremely high and potentially erroneous expected return figure is crucial.  The extremely negative EPS in Q4 2024 demands immediate attention and explanation.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
