## Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) Stock Review

**0. Overview & Key Figures:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.

* **Cumulative Return (SEDG):** -57.30%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 117.88%
* **Return Difference (SEDG vs. VOO):** -175.2% (Relative Divergence: 1.5)
* **Current Closing Price:** $17.62


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SEDG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return vastly inferior to the benchmark.  The -175.2% difference highlights a substantial underperformance. The relative divergence of 1.5 indicates that this underperformance is relatively low compared to the historical range of differences between SEDG and VOO.


The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and varying performance across different timeframes.  While periods of exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) are observed,  recent years (2021-2025) show dramatically negative CAGRs, indicating significant market downturn and potential issues within the company.  The consistently high Beta values (especially in 2018-2021) suggest high sensitivity to market movements, amplifying both gains and losses. The fluctuating alpha suggests that the stock's performance has not consistently outperformed the market after accounting for its beta.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $17.746
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.8335
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $14.4175

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a slight short-term bearish trend.  However, it sits above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential upward momentum in the medium to long term.  A recent price drop of -3.13% is notable.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 69.69 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 3.34 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, >2 years):** 24292.4% (This figure requires further clarification and validation.  Such a high expected return is highly improbable and warrants careful scrutiny of the calculation methodology. It is likely a miscalculation or misrepresentation).

The RSI suggests the stock is approaching overbought conditions, potentially indicating a short-term correction. The positive PPO reinforces the short-term upward momentum.  The high expected return needs further investigation and should be treated with skepticism. The large negative price change should be investigated and any significant market events impacting the price considered.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals significant losses in recent quarters.  Revenue has fluctuated, and there's a clear downward trend in profitability.  The substantial loss in the most recent quarter (2024-11-07) warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.  The apparent duplicate entry for 2024-11-07 needs clarification.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13 | $0.26 B |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31 | $0.27 B |

| 2024-11-07 | -1.08 | $0.73 B |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data confirms the negative trends observed in the earnings.  Profit margins are consistently negative, except for one quarter (2023-09-30), indicating significant financial distress. ROE (Return on Equity) is also largely negative, further highlighting the company's poor financial performance. The substantial drop in equity in recent quarters is cause for concern.  The data necessitates a thorough review of the company's financial health and its underlying business model.

|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B | -269.19% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's performance has been extremely poor, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Financial statements reveal serious concerns regarding profitability and equity.  While short-term indicators show some potential for a slight upward trend, the overall picture suggests substantial financial distress and high risk.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return is highly suspect and should be disregarded. A deep dive into the reasons for the significant losses and the recent negative trends in revenue and profitability is crucial before considering any investment.  Further investigation into the company’s strategic direction and operational efficiency is strongly recommended.  The current situation presents a high level of risk.
