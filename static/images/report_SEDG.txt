## Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) Stock Report

**0) Overview:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. is a leading provider of solar power optimizers, inverters, and energy storage solutions.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SEDG's cumulative return of -71.14% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 74.21%. The difference is a substantial -145.4%, placing it at the 2.7th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 (based on a relative divergence of -145.4, with a historical range from -174.1 to 905.7).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and significant beta values, particularly in recent years (2021-2025), suggesting high sensitivity to market movements.  The negative CAGR in the last three years (-631%, -639%, -701%) indicates severe underperformance. While periods of high positive CAGR and Alpha existed, recent performance has been drastically negative. The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values further highlight the significant risk associated with SEDG.  The shrinking market cap also points to investor concern.


**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.64
* **5-day Moving Average:** $12.90
* **20-day Moving Average:** $14.77
* **60-day Moving Average:** $15.35

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent 1.2% increase may be a temporary bounce.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.6 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions, but this should be interpreted cautiously given the long-term negative trend.)
* **PPO:** -1.81 (Negative value, confirming bearish momentum.)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +0.3 (Short-term upward trend, but insignificant given the larger bearish context.)
* **Expected Return:** 10388% - This incredibly high figure needs further clarification on its calculation methodology.  It's crucial to understand the assumptions and timeframe behind this prediction, as it appears unrealistic given the company's current performance and the negative CAGR displayed.  The claim of outperforming the S&P 500 by this magnitude over two years is highly improbable.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings reports reveal significant losses (negative EPS) and a decline in revenue in the latest quarters.  There's a discrepancy in the provided data (two entries for 2024-11-07). Data consistency needs to be improved for a more reliable analysis. The generally negative EPS figures corroborate the poor stock performance.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13  | $0.26B       |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31   | $0.27B       |
| 2024-05-09 | -2.75   | $0.20B       |
| 2023-11-06 | -1.08   | $0.73B       |
| 2024-11-07 | -1.08   | $0.73B       |


**5) Financial Information:**

The financial statements reveal significant issues with profitability.  Negative profit margins and Return on Equity (ROE) in several quarters indicate serious financial difficulties.  While the equity remains positive, the decreasing trend and alarmingly high negative ROE figures warrant concern.  Revenue fluctuations are also notable.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B   | -80.66%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B   | -269.19%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27B   | -4.13%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.20B   | -12.81%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.32B   | -17.85%       |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE          |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.66B   | -47.53%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B   | -126.03%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B   | -6.21%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.24B   | -7.02%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.41B   | -6.73%       |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

SEDG is currently experiencing significant financial and operational challenges. The stock's severe underperformance against the S&P 500, negative earnings, highly volatile Beta, shrinking market cap, and negative profit margins paint a bleak picture.  While oversold conditions (RSI below 40) might suggest a potential bounce, the fundamental issues need to be addressed before any significant recovery can be expected. The incredibly high projected return of 10388% is highly dubious and requires thorough verification.  Investing in SEDG carries substantial risk.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the poor performance and future business prospects is crucial before considering any investment.
