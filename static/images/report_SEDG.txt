Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy storage solutions.  The cumulative return of SEDG is -67.64%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 117.96%.

This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Table Analysis:** The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows periods of exceptional growth followed by a sharp decline in recent years (2021-2024). The high Beta values (especially 2018-2020) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The consistently low Alpha values suggest that the stock has not significantly outperformed its benchmark after accounting for market risk.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures further highlight the significant risk associated with SEDG.
