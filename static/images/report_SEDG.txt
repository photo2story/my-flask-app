**Analysis:**

*   The table clearly illustrates a drastic decline in performance, particularly in recent years.
*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has gone from extremely high positive values to significantly negative territory, reflecting severe losses for investors.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) consistently shows very high downside risk, with drawdowns exceeding 70-80% in most periods.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha, representing excess return relative to the market, is now heavily negative, indicating significant underperformance compared to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta values suggest that SEDG's volatility is generally in line with or slightly less volatile than the market, until it goes negative in the most recent period.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has fluctuated significantly.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 36.55
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 37.96, Previous Close: 38.62, Change: -1.71
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 37.46
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 34.03
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 30.03

**Analysis:** The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, but above the 20 and 60 day averages. The Last-market data shows a negative change which confirms a downtrend, but the fact that the price is above the 20 and 60 day averages suggests a potential for short-term upward movement. The price movement indicates that the stock might be trying to consolidate after a period of decline.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended - with a caveat)
*   **RSI:** 66.37
*   **PPO:** 0.82
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (712 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-19)
*   **20-Day Relative Spread Delta:** -0.1 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1726.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** While the MRI suggests "High Investment Recommended," this should be viewed cautiously given the other negative factors. The MRI might be lagging and not fully reflecting recent negative data.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 66.37 is approaching overbought territory, suggesting that the stock may be due for a pullback or consolidation.
*   **PPO:**  A PPO of 0.82 indicates that the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, which is a marginally bullish sign, but it's not a strong signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy" signal must be interpreted with caution. The high MRI value is misleading and doesn't align with the analyst consensus or financial performance.
*   **20-Day Relative Spread Delta:** The negative delta indicates that the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is worsening in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The extraordinarily high Expected Return is likely based on statistical models that may not accurately reflect the current deteriorating fundamentals of the company. It should be viewed with extreme skepticism.

**7. Overall Conclusion:**

SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) presents a high-risk investment opportunity. While technical indicators suggest a potential for short-term gains, the fundamental picture is weak. The company is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, has negative earnings, declining equity, and negative profit margins. Analyst sentiment is neutral, with price targets generally *below* the current price. The seemingly positive MRI signal is misleading and contradicted by other data.

**Recommendation:** Exercise *extreme caution* with SEDG. A speculative short-term trade might be possible, but a long-term investment is not advisable based on the current data. Further research and a turnaround in financial performance would be necessary before considering a long-term position. The substantial losses, negative profitability, and negative analyst expectations make this stock very risky.
