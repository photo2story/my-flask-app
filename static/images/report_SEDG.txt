Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimization solutions.  The cumulative return for SEDG is -65.57%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 112.04%.  This represents a significant divergence of -177.6 percentage points.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility and significant swings in SEDG's performance.  While exhibiting periods of exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate),  recent years have seen dramatically negative returns.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $14.46
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $15.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $14.61

The price is slightly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potentially bearish short-term trend. The 5-day moving average being significantly higher indicates recent price decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 56.59 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.57 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 30338.6% (This extremely high figure requires further investigation and context. Itâ€™s likely an error or misinterpretation of data.  The projection is highly unlikely).

The current price of $14.46 does not indicate a significant recent price spike (neither a sharp upturn nor downturn) based on the moving averages. The exceptionally high expected return needs clarification and validation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals significant losses in recent quarters.  Revenue has fluctuated, but profits have been consistently negative, raising concerns about the company's profitability.  The large discrepancy between Q3 2023 and subsequent quarters warrants further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13  | $0.26B      |

| 2024-05-09 | -2.75   | $0.20B      |
| 2023-11-06 | -1.08   | $0.73B      |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's performance has been highly volatile and significantly underperformed the S&P 500, particularly in the last two years.  The company is facing substantial challenges in profitability, as evidenced by consistently negative profit margins and ROE.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity. While there may be potential for growth in the long term given the nature of the solar industry, the current financial picture is alarming.  Any investment decision should be made with extreme caution and after thorough due diligence, considering the significant financial risks involved. The projected 2-year return is implausible and should be disregarded.  Additional data and analysis are needed to validate the provided figures.
