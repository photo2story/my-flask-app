**1. Performance Comparison and Analysis:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimization solutions.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).

| Metric                     | SEDG        | VOO         | Difference |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Cumulative Return (%)       | -69.78%     | 86.36%      | -156.1%    |
| Relative Divergence (100%) | 1.7         | N/A         | N/A         |

SEDG's cumulative return is drastically lower than VOO's, indicating significant underperformance. The relative divergence of 1.7 shows it's near the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  The Alpha and Beta values in the provided table fluctuate significantly, suggesting high volatility and inconsistent performance relative to the market.  Note that the CAGR values provided are extremely high in certain years and extremely negative in others and need further clarification as to whether this is yearly data, or rolling period calculations.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The Alpha and Beta values are highly volatile, ranging from significantly negative to positive, indicating that SEDG's performance is not consistently correlated with the market and shows that attempts to use Beta to understand market risk are insufficient. A beta of >1 shows this stock is more volatile than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $12.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.15

The recent price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The significant price increase of 4.47% from the previous close may signal a potential short-term reversal, but further observation is needed.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 16059.8% (This value seems unrealistic and requires further investigation and clarification on the calculation methodology).  This extremely high expected return is highly improbable and needs to be critically examined.


The price change of 4.47% suggests a significant positive price movement that requires clarification and further investigation.
