The equity has been declining rapidly along with ROE, reflecting the eroding profitability.

**7. Overall Analysis**

SolarEdge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) is facing significant challenges. While historically it has demonstrated periods of strong growth and outperformance, recent performance has been extremely poor, underperforming the S&P 500 substantially. Negative earnings reports, declining profitability, and eroding equity are major causes for concern. The technical indicators suggest a possible short-term uptrend, but the fundamental financial picture and recent news warrant caution. The extremely high "expected return" is likely an overestimation based on statistical models trying to compensate for prior underperformance and should be treated skeptically. Investors should closely monitor the company's financial performance, industry trends, and any significant news or announcements. The low MRI might indicate now is a good time to buy, however the recent financial information suggest otherwise.
