* **60-Day Moving Average:** $16.984

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The relatively large gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average highlights the recent significant price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 60.75  -  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.78 -  A positive value indicates upward momentum, although it's relatively low, possibly reflecting recent weakness.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 - Indicates a short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided expected return of 0% indicates no anticipated excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment. This is aligned with the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 shown in the initial data.
* **Current Price ($12.77) Consideration:**  The current price is below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages suggesting a potential downward trend, but the 20-day moving average is relatively close suggesting this is not an extreme downtrend.  There's no indication of a sudden jump (rapid rebound) or drop (rapid decline) based on the limited information.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows a sharp decline in profitability and revenue variability:


* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue has fluctuated significantly, with a significant drop from Q3 2023 ($0.73B) to subsequent quarters.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS has been consistently negative in recent quarters, indicating significant losses.  The substantial EPS drop from Q2 2024 (-$2.31) to Q3 2024 (-$21.13) is particularly concerning.
* **Notable Beats or Misses:** No expectations are provided, therefore it is impossible to evaluate the results against expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data reveals significant deterioration in profitability and potentially concerning capital changes:

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Profit margins are severely negative in the last two quarters, indicating substantial losses.  A very large negative profit margin (-269.19%) in Q3 2024 is extremely alarming.  The significant drop in revenue in recent quarters is likely a major driver for the poor profitability.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Return on Equity (ROE) is deeply negative across recent quarters, indicating a significant loss of shareholder value. The substantial drop in equity from Q2 2024 ($2.11B) to Q3 2024 ($0.96B) raises serious concerns regarding financial stability.

This section requires additional information.  The prompt only mentions "recent earnings news" but does not provide specific news items, market outlook or analyst opinions.  This section cannot be completed without that information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. Recent quarterly results reveal a drastic decline in profitability and revenue, highlighted by enormously negative profit margins and an alarming drop in equity.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term trend.  Without additional information regarding current market sentiment, recent news and analyst opinions,  a conclusive investment recommendation cannot be made. However, the severe financial distress and substantial underperformance raise serious concerns about the viability of SEDG as an investment at present.  The extremely negative EPS and profit margins indicate significant underlying problems that require a deeper investigation before any long-term investment consideration.
