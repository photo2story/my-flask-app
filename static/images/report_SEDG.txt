**Analysis:**

*   **High Volatility (MDD):** Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures are consistently high, indicating significant price volatility and potential risk.  MDD has been very high in recent years, consistently at or above 79%, meaning the stock has fallen close to 80% from its recent peak during those periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha was strongly positive in the 2017-2022 period, indicating outperformance relative to the market.  However, Alpha has been very negative in recent years (2021-2025), indicating substantial underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally low, suggesting the stock is not highly correlated with the overall market. Beta even becomes negative at the end of the period, suggesting an inverse relationship with the market (although the magnitude is small).
*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows very high growth in the 2017-2022 period, but very large negative growth in 2021-2025.
*   **Cap:** The market capitalization in billions of dollars indicates the company was larger in the 2018-2022 period, but has declined significantly in recent years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 28.47
*   **Previous Close:** 28.92
*   **Change:** -1.56
*   **5-day SMA:** 28.988
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.695
*   **60-day SMA:** 35.7597

**Analysis:**

The current close is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a recent downtrend. The 5-day SMA is closer to the current price, while the 60-day SMA is significantly higher, further reinforcing the downtrend. The recent price decrease of -1.56 indicates downward pressure on the stock.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 23.63
*   **PPO:** -0.702
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-06)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1776.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  While classified as "Medium Investment," remember that the MRI scale seems to favor investment, with "Very Risky" still being above 0.
*   **RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 23.63 indicates that the stock is currently *oversold*.  This *could* suggest a potential for a price rebound, but it also indicates strong selling pressure.
*   **PPO:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) of -0.702 is negative, further confirming the downtrend and indicating that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests buying 100% of available cash, indicating a potentially positive outlook based on the factors considered in the hybrid model, however, please note the date is very old and may not be relevant. This contrasts with the other negative indicators.
*   **Divergence Change:**  The 20-day relative divergence change suggests a potential short-term upward movement.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative Expected Return of -1776.6%  is an alarming figure, suggesting that long-term investment at the current price is predicted to result in very significant losses. It is highly unlikely this value is correctly calculated, but it highlights deep concern.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Analyst Opinions:** Recent news includes a new analyst forecast with a $31 price target, but also a Citigroup maintaining a "Sell" rating and lowering the price target to $29.00. MarketBeat also reports Citigroup lowering the price target to $29.
*   **Weak Shipments and Dilution Fears:** An article mentions a 5.7% drop due to weak shipments and dilution fears.
*   **Potential Benefit from Rising U.S. Solar Demand:** There's a positive article suggesting SolarEdge could benefit from rising U.S. solar demand.
*   **Dividend Discussion:** One article discusses whether SEDG stock will deliver consistent dividends.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed.  While there's some potential upside with rising solar demand, the negative analyst ratings, lowered price targets, and concerns about weak shipments and dilution are significant headwinds.  The discussion about dividends is likely prompted by financial uncertainty and potential difficulty in maintaining payouts.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions (consensus / targets / recent changes):**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean:** 3.30 (~Hold)
*   **Opinions:** 23
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 33.04 / 44.00 / 17.00

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is "Hold" with a mean rating of 3.30, suggesting a neutral sentiment. The average target price of $33.04 is slightly above the current price, indicating a moderate potential upside according to analysts. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices ($44.00 and $17.00, respectively) reflects significant uncertainty and disagreement among analysts. Recent rating changes are not available in the data provided.
