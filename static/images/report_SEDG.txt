## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

SEDG, Solaredge Technologies Inc., is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.  The company shows significant performance divergence compared to the S&P 500, exhibiting substantial losses recently.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **SEDG Cumulative Return:** -60.36%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 121.41%
* **Return Difference:** -181.8%  (This signifies SEDG underperformed VOO significantly. The relative divergence of 0.9 indicates the current underperformance is near the historical minimum.)

The provided CAGR data shows periods of exceptional growth followed by substantial losses in recent years.  The high beta values (particularly in 2018-2021) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. The consistently positive alpha in recent years suggests that even during negative periods, SEDG potentially outperformed the market's expectations by a certain margin.  However, this must be viewed cautiously given the highly negative returns in the most recent years.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $16.36
* **5-day Moving Average:** $14.42
* **20-day Moving Average:** $13.93
* **60-day Moving Average:** $13.93

The price is above all moving averages, suggesting potential upward momentum, although this needs further investigation considering the overall negative trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 64.06 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 1.48 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 37213.1% (This exceptionally high figure needs clarification and likely represents an error in the data provided. It is not realistic over a 2-year period and requires further investigation.)

The positive PPO and RSI, combined with a slightly positive relative divergence, hint at potential short-term upward movement.  However, the extremely high expected return is suspect and requires further scrutiny of the methodology and inputs.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13  | $0.26 B        |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31   | $0.27 B        |

| 2024-11-07 | -1.08   | $0.73 B        | *(Duplicate entry?)*

The recent earnings show significant losses, particularly in the November 2024 report.  Revenue has fluctuated, with a notable drop in Q2 2024.  The duplicated entry for November 2024 needs clarification.  Further analysis is required to understand the reasons behind these losses.  The absence of gross profit and total revenue data in the following section casts doubt on the accuracy of the provided earnings information.


**5. Financial Information:**

The statement "No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data available for SEDG" is concerning.  A thorough financial analysis is impossible without this critical information.  The provided earnings data needs verification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG has experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly in the last year. While some short-term technical indicators suggest potential upward momentum, the substantial and consistent losses in recent earnings, coupled with missing key financial data, paint a concerning picture. The highly volatile nature of the stock, as indicated by the high beta, adds to the risk.  The extremely high projected return figure needs immediate validation.  Before any investment decision, a thorough review of the company's financials and a deeper understanding of the reasons for the recent losses are crucial. The provided data is incomplete and raises serious concerns about its reliability.
