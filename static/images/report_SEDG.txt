2025-12-23 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down this comprehensive report on SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG).

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **SEDG Overview:** SolarEdge Technologies Inc. provides power optimizer, solar inverter, and monitoring solutions for photovoltaic arrays.
*   **SEDG Cumulative Return:** -74.23%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 101.68%
*   **Divergence:** -175.9 (Relative Divergence: 0.1)
*   **Analysis:** SEDG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, resulting in a large negative divergence.  The relative divergence being at 0.1 suggests the current divergence is very near the *minimum* divergence seen in the historical data.  This means the underperformance is as severe as it has been, historically, within the given data range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 65.0%   | 57.4%   | 40.0%   | 0.1    | 2.4    |
| 2016-2018  | 11.0%   | 72.4%   | -4.0%   | 0.1    | 2.2    |
| 2017-2019  | 155.0%  | 72.4%   | 133.0%  | 0.8    | 6.0    |
| 2018-2020  | 476.0%  | 80.0%   | 452.0%  | 0.8    | 20.3   |
| 2019-2021  | 262.0%  | 80.0%   | 215.0%  | 0.4    | 17.9   |
| 2020-2022  | 165.0%  | 80.0%   | 166.0%  | 0.5    | 18.0   |
| 2021-2023  | -474.0% | 79.3%   | -475.0% | 0.5    | 6.0    |
| 2022-2024  | -312.0% | 79.3%   | -332.0% | 0.3    | 0.9    |
| 2023-2025  | -363.0% | 82.5%   | -429.0% | -0.1   | 1.9    |

*   **Analysis:** The table paints a picture of extreme volatility.  While earlier periods (2015-2022) show very high CAGR and Alpha, recent periods (2021-2025) exhibit massive losses. Maximum Drawdown (MDD) remains consistently high, indicating significant risk. The Alpha figures reflect how much SEDG has outperformed (positive Alpha) or underperformed (negative Alpha) its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. Beta values fluctuated but were relatively low (close to 0) indicates low correlation with market, and even a negative beta for the most recent period. The market capitalization (Cap) has significantly decreased from 2020 to 2024.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 29.06
*   **Last-market:** price': 30.91, 'previousClose': 29.06, 'change': 6.37
*   **5-day SMA:** 28.894
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.4935
*   **60-day SMA:** 35.6123
*   **Analysis:** The price has recently increased (price': 30.91, 'previousClose': 29.06, 'change': 6.37), with the 5-day SMA below the 20-day SMA and the 20-day SMA below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term upward trend, but the overall trend based on the longer-term moving averages is still downward.

**3. Indicators Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 33.65 (Approaching oversold, but not quite there)
*   **PPO:** -0.4864 (Below zero suggests a downward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -1967.7% (Extremely negative expected return compared to S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:** The RSI suggests the stock *may* be approaching oversold territory, which *could* indicate a potential bounce. However, the negative PPO and significant negative expected return raise concerns.  The "Medium Investment" rating from the MRI needs to be taken with caution, given the other indicators. The 'Buy' signal based on hybrid Signal needs to be taken with caution, given the other indicators,

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines are a mixed bag:
    *   **Positive:** Morgan Stanley's Upgrade, Analyst Optimism (though reassessing valuation)
    *   **Neutral:** Wells Fargo Maintains Equal-Weight Recommendation
    *   **Negative:** Wells Fargo Lowers Price Target
    *   **General:** SolarEdge (SEDG) Stock Is Up, What You Need To Know
    *   **Earnings:** Q3 revenue reported (some positive aspects mentioned like margin improvement).
    *   **Price Target:** A new price target of $31 was given.

*   **Analysis:** The news is not overwhelmingly positive. While some analysts are expressing renewed optimism, there's also concern and downward revisions.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 3.30)
*   **Target Price:** Average: $32.65, High: $44.00, Low: $17.00
*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," but the wide range in target prices ($17 to $44) reflects a lack of conviction and significant uncertainty. The absence of recent rating changes suggests that analysts are waiting for more clarity before making significant adjustments to their recommendations.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출       |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.84    | 0.34 B$    |
| 2025-08-07 | -2.13    | 0.29 B$    |
| 2025-05-08 | -1.7     | 0.22 B$    |
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13   | 0.24 B$    |
| 2025-11-06 | -21.58   | 0.24 B$    |

*   **Analysis:** The earnings data shows consistent losses (negative EPS). While the most recent quarter shows a slightly improved EPS (-0.84) compared to previous quarters, the revenue has been fluctuating but remain almost same level. The EPS number listed on 2025-11-06 of -21.58 appears to be erroneous data, duplicated with 2024-11-07 data.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.34B   | 21.21%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.29B   | 11.10%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.22B   | 7.99%         |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B   | -80.66%       |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.24B   | -309.13%      |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE      |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.48B   | -10.43%  |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.51B   | -24.31%  |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.59B   | -16.58%  |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.66B   | -47.53%  |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.96B   | -128.69% |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has fluctuated, with the most recent quarter showing the highest revenue in the dataset. However, profitability is a major concern, with deeply negative profit margins in late 2024. While the profit margins have recovered into the positive territory in 2025, they may not be sufficient enough. Equity is declining, and Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating profits from shareholder investments.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Overall:** SolarEdge is currently facing significant challenges.  It has drastically underperformed the S&P 500. Recent stock performance has been poor, and the company is reporting losses.
*   **Financials:** Revenue is inconsistent. Profitability is weak. Equity is decreasing. ROE is negative.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The RSI *may* suggest a possible short-term bounce, but the overall trend is negative based on moving averages and the PPO. The 'Buy' signal based on hybrid Signal needs to be taken with caution, given the other indicators.
*   **News/Analyst Sentiment:** The news is mixed, and analyst consensus is "Hold" with a wide target price range, reflecting uncertainty.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** Based on this data, investing in SolarEdge appears very risky at this time. While the stock may be oversold and experience a short-term rebound, the fundamental financial challenges and negative earnings outlook suggest caution is warranted.  A long-term investment is not advisable based on the data provided.

In short, while there might be short-term trading opportunities, a long-term investment in SEDG appears highly speculative based on the information provided.
