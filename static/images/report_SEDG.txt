**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values indicate significant volatility and market sensitivity.  High beta values (2.1-18.8) in earlier years suggest SEDG's returns were highly correlated with and amplified market movements.  The drastically negative CAGR in recent years (-691% to -731%) and persistently high MDD indicate substantial risk and significant downside potential.  The increasing alpha values in recent years suggest the stock may be exhibiting outperformance compared to the market in such periods of significant decline, although these results require further investigation.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $17.03
* **Previous Close:** $17.12
* **Change:** -$0.09 (-0.53%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $17.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $16.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.33

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent downward pressure.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 68.93 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.12 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +0.1 (Short-term upward trend)

The RSI suggests the stock may be nearing overbought conditions, potentially indicating a short-term correction might be likely. The positive PPO supports the bullish momentum observed in the moving averages. The recent relative divergence is positive, aligning with the current price action. The large negative price change (-$0.09) is minor and does not suggest a sharp downward trend. The projected long-term expected return of 13967.4% is exceptionally high and requires careful scrutiny. It is highly improbable that this could occur.  Further analysis of the assumptions underlying this projection is needed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals consistent net losses in recent quarters.  Revenue fluctuates but shows no clear upward trend.  The significant losses, particularly in Q3 and Q4 2024, need careful attention.  Duplicate data entries for 2024-11-07 require clarification.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |

| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13   | $0.26B      |

| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08    | $0.73B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial statements show significant profitability issues in recent quarters.  The negative profit margins and ROE are alarming, indicating the company is currently not generating profits and experiencing losses in relation to its shareholder's equity. The large swings in equity values require investigation.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.17B     | -80.66%       |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.26B     | -269.19%      |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.27B     | -4.13%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.20B     | -12.81%       |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.32B     | -17.85%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE           |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.66B     | -47.53%       |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.96B     | -126.03%      |
| 2024-06-30  | $2.11B     | -6.21%        |

| 2023-12-31  | $2.41B     | -6.73%        |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, experiencing substantial losses and negative profit margins. While some technical indicators suggest short-term upward momentum, the fundamental financial picture is concerning.  The extremely high projected long-term return is unrealistic without further explanation and justification. The company's high beta in the past highlights its sensitivity to market movements, while recent high alpha values during a significant downturn warrant closer scrutiny.  Before any investment decision, a thorough review of the company's financial health, future prospects, and the validity of the extremely high expected return projection is strongly recommended.  The data inconsistencies, particularly the duplicate entries and volatile financial figures, raise serious concerns and require further investigation before any conclusive analysis can be made.
