## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG), a leading provider of solar power optimizers and inverters, has experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) in recent years.  While exhibiting periods of high growth, the company currently shows substantial negative returns and concerning financial metrics.  Further analysis is needed to determine future prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) is a leading provider of DC optimized inverter systems for the solar photovoltaic industry.

* **Cumulative Return Difference:** SEDG's cumulative return (-71.13%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return (83.04%), resulting in a substantial divergence of -154.2 (relative divergence of 1.8%). This places it near the lower bound of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided Alpha/Beta data shows high volatility and varying levels of beta (market sensitivity).  While periods of extremely high CAGR were observed (e.g., 787% from 2018-2020), these were followed by steep declines. The consistently high beta suggests SEDG's performance is strongly correlated with the broader market, amplified by periods of extreme volatility.  Recent negative alpha suggests underperformance compared to the market.

|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 68.0% | 62.3% | -0.1 | 2.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 18.0% | 66.2% | -0.0 | 2.1 |

| 2018-2020  | 787.0% | 86.8% | 0.3 | 18.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 657.0% | 86.8% | 0.2 | 16.6 |
| 2020-2022  | 414.0% | 86.8% | 0.3 | 16.7 |
| 2021-2023  | -631.0% | 72.1% | 0.7 | 5.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -639.0% | 74.9% | 0.7 | 0.8 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.22

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-to-medium-term trend.  The recent price increase (1.18%) might be a temporary bounce, but the overall trend remains negative.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 51.80 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.1794 (Positive, indicating potential bullish momentum, but weak)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.9 (Short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 15340.3% (This extremely high number requires further investigation and clarification on the calculation method. It likely represents a potential upside, assuming a reversal of current trends and return to previous high-growth periods. It should not be considered a reliable forecast).


The relatively low MRI and RSI suggest limited immediate risk. However, the negative divergence and current price trends caution against optimism in the short term.  The high expected return needs further context and should be viewed cautiously.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistently negative EPS, indicating significant losses. While revenue shows some variability, it doesn't compensate for the substantial losses.  There's a discrepancy in the provided data (two entries for 2024-11-07).  A consistent trend of negative EPS across several quarters indicates serious financial challenges.

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출       |
|------------|---------|------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13  | 0.26 B$    |

| 2024-11-07 | -1.08   | 0.73 B$    |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability data reveal a troubling financial picture.  Profit margins are consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating profits.  ROE is also significantly negative, suggesting poor return on invested capital. The recent quarter shows a dramatic deterioration in several key metrics. Further investigation is required to understand the underlying causes.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B   | -80.66%       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's performance is currently deeply concerning.  The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, coupled with consistently negative EPS and profit margins, points to substantial financial challenges. While past periods of high growth exist, the recent trends are overwhelmingly negative.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity, making the stock highly volatile.  Before considering any investment, a thorough understanding of the underlying causes of the negative performance and future outlook is crucial.  The extremely high projected return should be treated with extreme skepticism without further supporting data and analysis.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before any investment decisions.
