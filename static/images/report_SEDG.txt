**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Further analysis with complete and consistent data is necessary for a proper assessment.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of crucial financial data like Total Revenue and Gross Profit significantly hampers a thorough financial analysis.  This missing information prevents a robust assessment of the company's financial health and profitability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's recent performance has been significantly negative, underperforming the S&P 500 considerably. While historical data shows periods of substantial growth, the current trend is bearish, supported by the price action relative to moving averages and the negative EPS figures. The lack of comprehensive financial data and the unexplained extremely high expected return figure hinders a complete evaluation.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent decline in earnings and a comprehensive review of the financial statements are crucial before forming any investment conclusions.  The high beta also suggests considerable risk.  A cautious approach is recommended until more information becomes available.
