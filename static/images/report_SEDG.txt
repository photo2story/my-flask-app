## Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.  Recent performance has been significantly negative, underperforming the S&P 500 considerably.  While showing periods of strong growth in the past, the company currently faces financial challenges reflected in negative EPS and profit margins.  Further investigation is needed to assess the long-term viability and investment potential.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) shows a cumulative return of -67.84%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 89.44%. This represents a significant divergence of -157.3 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -1.9 indicates that SEDG's performance is in the lower percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and inconsistent performance across different periods. While experiencing extremely high CAGR in some years, recent performance (2021-2025) exhibits extremely negative CAGR, suggesting significant market risk.  The high Beta values (often exceeding 1) indicate high sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $16.68
* **5-day moving average:** $16.15
* **20-day moving average:** $16.44
* **60-day moving average:** $15.58

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent price increase.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the moving averages indicates a moderate upward trend.  The "Last-market" data shows a 3.12% increase from the previous close, indicating a recent price jump.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.79 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.5954 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 14964.5%  This exceptionally high figure needs further explanation and justification.  It's likely an error or misinterpretation of the data provided.  The exceptionally high expected return is not supported by the other data provided and should be treated with extreme skepticism.

The recent price increase ('change': 3.12%) suggests a potential short-term uptrend, but the negative PPO and moderate market risk suggest caution.  The high expected return requires clarification.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13  | $0.26B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31   | $0.27B      |

| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08   | $0.73B      | *(Note: Duplicate entry.  Presumably an error)*

The earnings data shows consistently negative EPS across recent quarters, indicating significant losses. Revenue fluctuates but shows a considerable decline in the last quarter (2024-11-07), which is further supported by the significantly negative EPS figure for the same period.  A data correction is needed to address the duplicate entry.

The financial statements highlight significant losses (negative profit margins and ROE) across recent quarters, with a particularly concerning decline in Q4 2024.  These figures strongly suggest underlying financial weakness.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's recent performance is severely underperforming the market, exhibiting substantial losses and negative growth.  While past performance showed periods of significant growth, the current financial situation is highly problematic. The high Beta indicates significant market risk. The exceptionally high stated expected return is not supported by the provided data and needs further investigation and clarification.  Before considering any investment, a thorough review of the company's business strategy, competitive landscape, and future outlook is crucial. The data provided strongly suggests a high level of risk.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the data (duplicate entry, wildly optimistic expected return) is necessary.
