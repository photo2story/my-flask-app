* **20-day Moving Average:** $15.12
* **60-day Moving Average:** $18.85

* **PPO (-3.28):** Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (0.03 +):**  A slight positive change in relative divergence over the last 20 days suggests a short-term upward trend. However, this needs confirmation.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The expected return of 0% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 suggests that, despite potential for a bounce, long-term outperformance is uncertain, particularly given the current financial performance.

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources such as Shacknews and Finbold.

While technical indicators suggest potential short-term bounces due to oversold conditions, the underlying financial weakness raises serious concerns about long-term prospects.  The stock's high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  The lack of positive long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 further dampens its attractiveness.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is essential before making any investment decisions.  Currently, the risk-reward profile appears heavily skewed towards risk.
