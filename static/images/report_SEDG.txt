**Analysis:** The table shows a dramatic shift in SEDG's performance. While earlier periods showed high CAGR and significant alpha, the recent years (2021-2025) are marked by substantial negative CAGR and negative alpha, indicating consistent underperformance against the market. The beta values have generally been low, suggesting that the stock's movements are less correlated with the market. The significant drop in market cap from 2020-2022 to 2022-2024 is also a cause for concern.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **Current Price:** $34.71
*   **Previous Close:** $34.11
*   **Change:** 1.76%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** $32.298
*   **20-day Moving Average:** $32.4082
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $28.2182

**Analysis:** The stock price is above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The positive change from the previous close reinforces this.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3324 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 55.32 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.2208 (Slightly Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash 66%, Sell 5.7% of holdings (35 shares) - Caution - MRI:0.33
*   **20-day Relative Spread Change:** -0.9 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 17771.2 (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The low MRI suggests a relatively stable market environment. The RSI is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The negative PPO hints at a slight bearish trend. The hybrid signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending a high cash position and selling a small portion of holdings.  The negative change in relative spread confirms the recent underperformance.

*The extremely high "Expected Return" figure (17771.2%) is likely an outlier or a result of the model extrapolating from a very depressed base. It should not be interpreted as a realistic projection of future returns.*

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. The positive headlines about shipments are encouraging, suggesting potential revenue growth. However, the analyst price target raise to $26, while seemingly positive, is significantly lower than the current price, which could be interpreted negatively. The article highlighting SEDG's underperformance is also concerning.

**Analysis:** The "Hold" consensus, combined with the wide range of target prices ($7 to $41), indicates significant uncertainty and disagreement among analysts about SEDG's future prospects.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜         | EPS    | 매출        |
| :----------- | :----- | :---------- |
| 2025-08-07 | -2.13  | 0.29 B$     |
| 2025-05-08 | -1.7   | 0.22 B$     |
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13 | 0.26 B$     |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31  | 0.27 B$     |
| 2025-08-07 | -2.31  | 0.27 B$     |

**Analysis:** The table shows consistently negative Earnings Per Share (EPS) and fluctuating revenue. The large negative EPS in 2024-11-07 indicates a particularly challenging quarter. The repeated date of 2025-08-07 with identical EPS and revenue suggests a potential data entry error or duplicate entry.

**6. Financial Information (Revenue, Profitability, Capital):**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
| :----------- | :------- | :------------ |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.29B   | 11.10%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.22B   | 7.99%         |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B   | -80.66%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B   | -269.19%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27B   | -4.13%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE      |
| :----------- | :------- | :------- |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.51B   | -24.31%  |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.59B   | -16.58%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.66B   | -47.53%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B   | -126.03% |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B   | -6.21%   |

**Analysis:**  Revenue has fluctuated, but the profit margins are deeply concerning. The negative profit margins in several quarters indicate significant losses. The Return on Equity (ROE) is also consistently negative, demonstrating that the company is not generating profits from its equity. The sharp decrease in Equity from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025 is another major red flag, suggesting significant capital erosion.

**7. Overall Assessment:**

Based on the provided data, SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) faces substantial challenges.

*   **Underperformance:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Earnings:**  Consistent negative EPS and ROE.
*   **Profitability Issues:**  Deeply negative profit margins in multiple quarters.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** "Hold" consensus with a wide range of target prices.
*   **Capital Erosion:**  Sharp decline in equity.
*   **Mixed News:** The shipment news is a positive sign, but is countered by negative coverage.
*   **Technical Signals:** Cautious hybrid signal to sell a small portion of holdings.

**Conclusion:** While the recent positive news regarding shipments might offer a glimmer of hope, the overall financial picture of SolarEdge is concerning. The negative trends in earnings, profitability, and equity suggest significant risks. A "Hold" rating seems appropriate, but further investigation and monitoring are crucial before making any investment decisions. The high expected return seems unrealistic given the current financials.
