## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG), a leading provider of solar inverters and power optimizers, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) recently. While exhibiting periods of high growth,  the company's stock price has experienced a steep decline in the latest period, showing substantial negative returns compared to the market benchmark. The following analysis delves into the performance, current market position, and potential future outlook.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return Comparison:** SEDG's cumulative return is -69.78%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's 86.36% return. This represents a substantial difference of -156.1 percentage points.  The relative divergence indicator of 1.7 suggests that the underperformance is relatively significant when compared to historical volatility in the difference between SEDG's and VOO's returns.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha and beta values show varying performance characteristics across different periods.  While showing periods with high positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, particularly from 2018-2021), the most recent periods (2021-2025) demonstrate consistently high positive beta (greater volatility than the market) and negative or extremely negative CAGR's(Compound Annual Growth Rates). This suggests significant market sensitivity and a recent sharp downturn, irrespective of market performance.  It's important to note that CAGR values for 2023-2025 are projections and subject to significant uncertainty.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 68.0%    | 62.3%    | -0.1  | 2.2   |        |
| 2016-2018  | 18.0%    | 66.2%    | -0.0  | 2.1   |        |
| 2017-2019  | 227.0%   | 66.2%    | 0.3   | 5.6   |        |
| 2018-2020  | 787.0%   | 86.8%    | 0.3   | 18.8  |        |

| 2021-2023  | -631.0%  | 72.1%    | 0.7   | 5.5   |        |
| 2022-2024  | -639.0%  | 74.9%    | 0.7   | 0.8   |        |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $12.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.15

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent price change of 4.47% from the previous close indicates a recent slight upward movement, possibly signaling a temporary reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk).  This suggests a moderate level of risk associated with the current market conditions.

* **RSI:** 52.08.  This is close to the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.

* **PPO:** 0.86.  A positive PPO suggests a bullish momentum, which is somewhat at odds with the recent price action.  Further investigation is required.

* **Relative Strength Change (20-Day):** -0.3. This indicates a recent weakening in the relative strength of SEDG compared to the market.

* **Expected Return:** 16059.8%. This exceptionally high figure needs careful interpretation. It is likely to represent a projection under specific circumstances and is highly sensitive to various factors including the model used for projection.  A figure of this magnitude requires more context and validation before it can be considered reliable. It might be referring to the potential recovery following a sharp decline or the potential for a rebound in this highly volatile stock.

* **Significant Price Change:** The 4.47% increase from the previous close warrants attention as a potentially significant short-term upward movement. It may be related to recent news or a temporary market shift. Further analysis of the news flow and market dynamics is essential.

**Conclusion:**

SEDG's recent performance has been significantly negative, lagging the S&P 500 considerably. While historical data reveals periods of strong growth and high alpha, the current trend is bearish.  The positive PPO and slight price increase provide a small ray of potential for an upward movement, but the overall picture remains cautious given the negative CAGR's and high beta during the most recent periods.  The extremely high expected return requires significant scrutiny, and investors should conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. The high volatility and substantial negative returns necessitate a risk-averse approach.
