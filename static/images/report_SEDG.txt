* **Closing Price:** $13.35

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.15
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $16.36

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The relatively small difference between the 5 and 20-day moving averages suggests a recent period of low volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 56.76 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment.
* **PPO:** 1.14 – A positive PPO suggests a potential bullish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 – This indicates a recent short-term upward trend in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided 0% expected return suggests that over the long-term (2+ years) and assuming consistent investment, the model anticipates no outperformance relative to the S&P 500. Given the high volatility and negative recent performance, a 0% expectation is reasonable. The current price of $13.35 doesn't indicate a significant recent event (like a sharp jump or drop) based on the provided data.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings show a significant decline in profitability and revenue volatility.

* **Revenue:** Revenue is highly volatile, with Q3 2023 showing a peak of $0.73B, followed by substantial drops in subsequent quarters.  No consistent revenue growth trend is apparent.
* **EPS:** EPS is consistently negative across the provided quarters, indicating significant losses.  The large negative EPS in November 2024 (-$21.13) is particularly concerning.
* **Comparison:** No expectations data is provided, preventing analysis of beats or misses.  However, based on the reported data alone, there is a clear downward trend in both revenue and EPS.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data reveals serious concerns regarding the company's financial health:

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Profit margins are consistently negative in recent quarters, with a dramatic -269.19% margin in Q3 2024. This indicates severe losses relative to revenue. The significant spike in revenue in Q3 2023 was not sustainable.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE is consistently negative, with exceptionally negative values in the recent quarters, signaling a significant loss of shareholder value. The equity decreased substantially from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 suggesting either significant losses or substantial shareholder dilution.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions were provided.  Without access to real-time information, any comment on market outlook is impossible.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG is currently experiencing a period of significant financial distress.  The consistently negative EPS and profit margins, coupled with volatile revenue and sharply negative ROE, paint a concerning picture. While the RSI and PPO indicate a potentially neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, this is overshadowed by the fundamentally weak financial performance and the substantial underperformance against the S&P 500.  The 0% expected return against the S&P 500 is a reasonable projection given the current context.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent decline in revenue and profitability is crucial before considering any investment.  The high volatility inherent in SEDG highlights the significant risk associated with this stock.
