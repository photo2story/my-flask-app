**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar inverters and power optimizers.  SEDG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return of -69.78% compared to VOO's 86.36%.  The relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is substantial (-156.1% difference).  The provided alpha/beta data shows high volatility and inconsistent performance. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), recent years (2021-2025) show negative CAGR and extremely negative alpha, suggesting significant underperformance compared to the market benchmark. The high beta values, particularly in the periods of strong growth, indicate high sensitivity to market movements. The recent dramatic drop in CAGR, which went negative in 2021 and continued until 2025,  needs further investigation.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 68.0% | 62.3% | 40.0% | -0.1 | 2.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 18.0% | 66.2% | -3.0% | -0.0 | 2.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price is $13.10, slightly below both the 5-day ($12.68) and 20-day ($12.78) moving averages, but significantly below the 60-day moving average ($15.15). This suggests a recent downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 52.08 indicates a relatively neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold. The PPO of 0.86 suggests potential upward momentum. The recent negative change in relative divergence (-0.3) indicates a short-term downward trend. The MRI of 0.37 suggests a medium risk level. The extremely high expected return (16059.8%)  needs further clarification and justification, as it seems unrealistic based on the provided data. This projected return is likely based on a highly optimistic scenario and should be treated with extreme caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant losses (negative EPS) in all reported quarters.  Revenue remains relatively stable, but the substantial losses raise concerns about the company's profitability. Further investigation into the causes of these losses is crucial.

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-05-08 | -1.7   | 0.22 B$   |
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13 | 0.26 B$   |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31  | 0.27 B$   |
| 2024-05-09 | -2.75  | 0.20 B$   |
| 2025-05-08 | -2.75  | 0.20 B$   |


**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a complete financial analysis.  This missing information is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of SEDG's financial health.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SEDG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While some periods showed strong growth, recent years have been characterized by substantial losses and negative growth. The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity. The missing financial data and the extremely high projected long-term return raise significant concerns.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the causes of the recent losses, the basis for the high projected return, and the complete financial statements are absolutely necessary. The current situation suggests a high-risk investment with significant uncertainty regarding future performance.  The extremely negative CAGR from 2021-2025 warrants serious caution.
