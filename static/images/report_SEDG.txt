Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) is a provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.

The cumulative return of SEDG is -67.38%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 119.93%.  The difference is a significant underperformance of **-187.3%**.

* **Closing Price:** $13.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $14.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $14.31

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price change of -$1.51 (approximately -1.08%) reflects a slight downward movement.

* **PPO:** -1.00 – Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.8 – Shows a recent decrease in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 39391.5% – This extraordinarily high expected return compared to the S&P 500 needs significant scrutiny.  Given the company's recent performance, this figure seems unrealistic and likely requires further explanation or justification of the model used to arrive at this number.

The company's financial health appears to be severely deteriorating.  Profit margins are deeply negative, and the return on equity (ROE) is also significantly negative, indicating serious issues with profitability and efficiency.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Solaredge Technologies is experiencing a significant downturn.  The stock price is declining, technical indicators are bearish, earnings are heavily negative, and financial statements reveal severe problems with profitability and ROE.  The extremely high projected long-term return of 39391.5% is highly questionable and requires critical review of the underlying assumptions.  The provided data paints a very negative picture of the company's current financial health and future prospects.  Investors should exercise extreme caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the dramatic decline in performance and the unusual November 2024 earnings figures is crucial before any investment decisions are made.
