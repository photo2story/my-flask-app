**Analysis:**

*   **Past Performance:** The table reveals a stark contrast between SEDG's performance in earlier years (2015-2022) and recent years (2021-2025).
*   **CAGR:** While showing extremely high growth in the past (e.g., 476% from 2018-2020), the CAGR has been significantly negative in recent periods.
*   **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** The MDD is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.  The consistent MDD around 80% suggests a vulnerability to market downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, measuring performance relative to the market, is overwhelmingly negative in the most recent periods, implying significant underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates, but in recent years is either slightly positive or negative, suggesting the stock has become less correlated with the overall market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has decreased dramatically, reflecting the negative performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 29.06
*   **Last Market:** Price: 30.74, Previous Close: 30.48, Change: 0.85
*   **5-day SMA:** 28.89
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.49
*   **60-day SMA:** 35.61

**Analysis:** The current price is below the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), suggesting a recent downtrend. The 5-day SMA is slightly below the current price, indicating a possible short-term bounce. The small positive change in the last market price might signal a minor recovery, but overall the trend is downwards based on the SMA comparison.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 33.65
*   **PPO:** -0.4864
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-06)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.1 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1967.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment rating suggests the stock carries moderate risk, though some caution is warranted.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 33.65 indicates that the stock is approaching oversold territory, which *could* suggest a potential for a rebound, but it is not a guarantee.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates the price is trending downwards.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal is conflicting, suggesting a full cash buy based on a "Very Safe" rating with a high MRI. This contradicts the individual MRI score and might be an anomaly.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term downtrend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests very poor future prospects based on the model used.

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news headlines present a mixed picture.
    *   Some articles discuss Morgan Stanley's upgrade and analyst optimism, indicating potential positive catalysts.
    *   Others highlight price declines and reassessments of valuation, reflecting ongoing concerns.
    *   Wells Fargo maintains an "Equal-Weight" recommendation, suggesting a neutral outlook.
    *   The Q3 revenue announcement shows some revenue, but also mentions margin improvement needs.

**Analysis:** The news suggests a lack of clear consensus on SolarEdge's future. Analyst opinions are split, and the company's performance is under scrutiny. While some see potential for recovery, others remain cautious.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) faces significant challenges.  The stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, and its historical growth has reversed into substantial losses. Recent earnings reports show negative EPS and declining equity. While revenue has shown some recovery, the long-term health and future of the company is questionable.  Analyst opinions are mixed, and the stock's technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest continued downward pressure. The extremely negative expected return highlights the high risk associated with this investment. The recent news articles show an interesting picture, with some optimists seeing the potential for Morgan Stanley's upgrade, others are more concerned by the price declines and reassessments. Wells Fargo sits in the neutral corner for the time being.

**Overall Conclusion:** Based on the information provided, investing in SEDG carries very high risk. A cautious approach is warranted, and further in-depth research is necessary before making any investment decisions. The company needs to demonstrate consistent profitability and a clear path to sustainable growth to restore investor confidence. The huge earnings misses are a significant red flag.
