*   **20-day Moving Average:** $26.15
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $20.70

**Analysis:** The recent price decline is significant (-4.36%), potentially driven by negative news flow or earnings concerns. The price is currently below the 5-day moving average but above the 20 and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend but still indicating some longer-term upward movement.

*   **Expected Return:** 22013.1% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days confirms a recent underperformance trend.
