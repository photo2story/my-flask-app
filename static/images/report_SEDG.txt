2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information on SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG), comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and including a comprehensive analysis.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **SEDG Overview:** SolarEdge Technologies Inc. is a global leader in smart energy technology, providing end-to-end solar power optimization, monitoring, and storage solutions.
*   **SEDG Cumulative Return:** -74.74%

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 65.0%   | 57.4%  | 40.0%    | 0.1    | 2.2    |

| 2018-2020  | 476.0%  | 80.0%  | 452.0%   | 0.8    | 19.1   |
| 2019-2021  | 262.0%  | 80.0%  | 215.0%   | 0.4    | 16.8   |
| 2020-2022  | 165.0%  | 80.0%  | 166.0%   | 0.5    | 16.9   |

| 2022-2024  | -312.0% | 79.3%  | -332.0%  | 0.3    | 0.8    |
| 2023-2025  | -364.0% | 82.5%  | -428.0%  | -0.1   | 1.7    |

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows massive growth potential between 2017 and 2021 but a sharp decline in recent years.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown indicates high volatility, with losses exceeding 70% in most periods.
*   **Alpha:** The stock significantly outperformed the market in the 2017-2022 window, while drastically underperforming in 2021-2025. This signals that SEDG's performance is not closely correlated with the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to or less than 1 indicate lower sensitivity to market movements than other stocks. The most recent beta (-0.1) shows an inverse correlation with the market.
*   **Cap:** The market cap grew significantly from 2017-2022 and fell sharply from 2022-2024, which reflects the stock's recent decline.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 28.47
*   **Previous Close:** 28.92
*   **Change:** -1.56 (-1.56 from the previous close signals a slight decline)
*   **5-day SMA:** 28.988
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.695
*   **60-day SMA:** 35.7597

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), indicating a downtrend. The 5-day SMA is close to the current price, suggesting potential short-term stability, but the 20 and 60-day SMAs are significantly higher, reinforcing the bearish trend.

**3) Indicators Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 23.63 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.702
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-06)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1776.6%

**Analysis:** The MRI is at 0.7, suggesting a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is in oversold territory (below 30), suggesting the stock may be undervalued and could experience a bounce. The PPO is negative, confirming the downward trend. The hybrid signal suggests buying, but the negative expected return and oversold RSI suggests high risk.
The recent relative divergence change points to a short-term uptick. However, the extremely negative Expected Return (%) indicates a very pessimistic outlook for long-term investment.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Analyst Sentiment:** Recent news reflects a mixed sentiment. Some analysts are lowering price targets (Citigroup maintaining a 'Sell' rating), while others present more optimistic forecasts.
*   **Weak Shipments and Dilution Fears:** News articles highlight concerns about weak shipments and potential stock dilution, contributing to the recent price decline.
*   **Potential for U.S. Solar Demand:** There are also reports suggesting SolarEdge could benefit from rising U.S. solar demand, offering a potential positive catalyst.
*   **Dividend Prospects:** Articles discuss the likelihood of SEDG offering consistent dividends, which can attract investors.

**Analysis:** The news flow paints a picture of short-term headwinds (analyst downgrades, shipment concerns) balanced against potential long-term opportunities (U.S. solar demand).

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (3.30)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 33.04 / High: 44.00 / Low: 17.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting a neutral outlook. The average target price is moderately above the current price, but the wide range between the high and low targets reflects significant uncertainty among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.84  | 0.34 B$    |
