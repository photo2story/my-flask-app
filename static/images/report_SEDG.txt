**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The CAGR demonstrates a dramatic shift from very high growth in earlier periods (2018-2020, 2019-2021) to severe negative growth in recent years (2021-2025).
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown remains substantial, indicating significant volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha mirrors the CAGR trend, showing extreme positive values in the past followed by deeply negative values recently.  This implies SEDG's performance is heavily dependent on company-specific factors rather than market movements.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are relatively low, suggesting SEDG has not been strongly correlated with the overall market.  However, the recent increase in Beta (0.5-0.7) suggests a slightly higher correlation with the market during its recent decline.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has decreased drastically in the recent period.

*   **60-day Moving Average:** 21.3705

**Analysis:** The recent price increase of 3.45% is notable. The price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend after recent weakness.  The price is substantially above the 60-day moving average.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3349 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 45.77

*   **Expected Return:** 21706.2% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A low MRI indicates the stock is currently in a period of low market risk, However, it contradicts recent underperformance.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 45.77 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The hybrid signal recommends a high cash position (66%) and a partial sell-off, reflecting caution.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** Negative value suggests recent underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (21706.2%) is highly unusual and should be treated with extreme skepticism. This likely reflects a statistical anomaly due to the recent dramatic price decline and potential for mean reversion.

The significant price change of 3.45% from the previous close indicates a volatile reaction to recent events. This could be a short-term bounce or the beginning of a reversal, but further observation is needed.
