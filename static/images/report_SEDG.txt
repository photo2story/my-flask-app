This indicates a significant change in the stock's behavior, moving from high growth and outperformance to substantial losses and increased sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $19.16
*   **Previous Close:** $19.84
*   **Change:** -3.43%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 17.286
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 13.7918
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 15.396

**Analysis:** The stock price has declined by 3.43% from the previous close. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but the recent price drop needs to be considered in context.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3676 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 76.088 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 6.3796
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.8 (Positive - Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 10417.1% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk, which might be misleading given the company-specific challenges.  The RSI is in overbought territory, suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback. The PPO is positive, indicating that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, supporting the potential short-term upward trend seen in the moving averages. The positive change in relative divergence indicates a recent improvement in SEDG's performance relative to the S&P 500. Despite these short-term positives, the incredibly high expected return (10417.1%) should be viewed with extreme skepticism, as it likely stems from a model attempting to correct for the recent extreme underperformance. **The negative change suggests a significant downturn potentially reflecting the recent price drop.**

**Capital and Profitability**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE      |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| 2025-03-31   | $0.59B  | -16.58%  |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.66B  | -47.53%  |

| 2024-03-31   | $2.24B  | -7.02%   |

**Analysis:** The financial data reinforces the negative trend. Profit margins have been deeply negative in recent quarters, indicating significant challenges in cost management or pricing. Return on Equity (ROE) is also sharply negative, reflecting the company's inability to generate profits from its equity base. Furthermore, the company's equity has been declining, potentially indicating financial strain.

**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) is facing significant challenges.  The company has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500. Recent performance indicators show negative EPS, declining revenue, and deeply negative profit margins and ROE. The stock exhibits high volatility. While there might be short-term positive signals from moving averages and relative divergence, the overall picture is concerning. The incredibly high long-term expected return is highly improbable and should not be relied upon. Investors should exercise extreme caution and closely monitor company-specific developments and industry trends before considering an investment in SEDG. The recent news highlighting volatility and analyst scrutiny further underscores the risks.
