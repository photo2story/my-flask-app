*   **Historical Performance:**  SEDG has experienced both periods of extremely high growth (2018-2020) and significant decline (2021-2025).
*   **Alpha:**  The alpha values indicate periods of significant outperformance (positive alpha) and substantial underperformance (negative alpha) relative to its benchmark. The recent years show extremely negative alpha, indicating considerable underperformance.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values have generally been low, suggesting that SEDG's price movement is not strongly correlated with the overall market. Recent Beta turns to negative value

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 35.07
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 35.02, Previous Close: 38.62, Change: -9.32% (Significant drop)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 35.922
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 35.8003
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 31.3891

**Analysis:** The price has fallen below all three moving averages, a bearish signal. The significant price drop in the last market session (-9.32%) is a concerning development, suggesting strong selling pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators & Outlook:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended). This seems contradictory given other indicators.
*   **RSI:** 49.04 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold).
*   **PPO:** -1.34 (Negative, indicating a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (26 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)" - This suggests a buy recommendation based on the model, but the "Very Safe" designation seems questionable given the company's recent performance.
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.4 (Negative, short-term decline).
*   **Expected Return:** 1271.8% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500).  This is a very high expected return, suggesting significant potential upside if the company can turn around its performance. However, it should be viewed with skepticism given recent struggles.

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests high investment suitability, but this is inconsistent with the negative price momentum, low RSI, and negative PPO. The expected return is high, but this must be balanced against the current negative trends.

**4. Recent News & Events:**

*   **Negative Headlines:** Several headlines highlight potential issues, including underperformance compared to peers, and being potentially overvalued.
*   **Positive Headlines:** Some headlines suggest the stock is "soaring" today, potentially offering an offset to the negative news, and potentially undervalued.
*   **Overall:** The news is mixed, with a slight lean towards caution.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 3.39)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: $25.10, High: $41.00, Low: $9.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes indicated in the data.

**Analysis:**  Analysts have a neutral "Hold" consensus. The average target price is *below* the current price, suggesting potential downside risk. The wide range between the high and low target prices indicates significant uncertainty among analysts.

**7. Overall Analysis & Recommendation:**

SEDG is currently facing significant challenges. The company has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, and its financial performance (negative EPS, declining equity, negative ROE) is concerning. The recent price drop and negative technical indicators confirm this. Although the model suggests a positive MRI, it's inconsistent with other data. Analysts are neutral, with an average target price below the current price, indicating potential downside.

While there is a high long-term expected return, the risks are substantial.

**Recommendation:** Based on the provided data, a *cautious* approach is warranted. The data suggests avoiding starting new positions in SEDG. Close monitoring of the company's financial performance and industry trends is crucial before considering any investment.
