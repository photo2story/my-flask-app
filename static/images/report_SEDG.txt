## Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power inverters and related technologies.  The cumulative return of SEDG is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between SEDG and VOO as of the last day in the provided data is -186.8%. This represents a substantial underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The provided relative divergence index of 0.5 indicates that this underperformance is within the lower range of historical divergence compared to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility in SEDG's performance and significant beta fluctuations. While exhibiting high CAGR in some periods (e.g., 843% from 2018-2020), recent performance has been extremely negative. The consistently low alpha values suggest that the stock has not significantly outperformed the market after accounting for its beta.  The large swings in beta highlight the stock's sensitivity to overall market movements, with a recent drop to 0.8 suggesting decreased sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $14.68
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.78
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $14.23

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average and the 60-day moving average, suggesting some short-term upward momentum, though the 5-day average indicates recent price weakness.  The significant change from the previous close (+8.1%) suggests a recent price surge.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 49.37 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.76 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Indicates a recent decrease in relative strength)
* **Expected Return:** 39073.1% (This extremely high figure needs careful scrutiny.  It's likely an error or miscalculation.  The context and calculation method for this figure are missing and should be clarified.)

The recent price surge (8.1% increase) needs further analysis to determine the underlying cause.  It could be due to market sentiment, news events, or temporary factors.  The high expected return value requires further investigation and should be treated with extreme caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals significant losses in recent quarters (Q3 & Q4 2024), especially a substantial loss of -$21.13 EPS in Q4 2024. Revenue has remained relatively stable, but profits are severely depressed, indicating potential challenges for the company.  The duplicated data for 2024-11-07 needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data shows significant deterioration in profitability. The massive negative profit margin in Q3 2024 (-269.19%) is extremely alarming, suggesting serious operational issues.  While revenue was high in Q3 2023, subsequent quarters have seen a dramatic drop in revenue and substantial losses.  ROE is also significantly negative in recent quarters, indicating that the company is not generating returns on shareholder equity.

**7. Overall Analysis Summary:**

SEDG has experienced a dramatic decline in performance relative to the S&P 500, with significant losses reported in recent earnings. Technical indicators show mixed signals, but the bearish PPO and negative relative divergence point toward potential downside risk. The company's financial health is concerning, given the massive negative profit margins and ROE in recent quarters. The extremely high expected return figure is suspect and requires verification. The recent price surge warrants further investigation to understand the cause.  Overall, SEDG appears to be a high-risk investment at the present time.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before any investment decision.
