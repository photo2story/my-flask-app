| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 68.0% | 62.3% | 40.0% | -0.1 | 2.4 |

| 2018-2020  | 787.0% | 86.8% | 758.0% | 0.3 | 20.4 |

| 2022-2024  | -639.0% | 74.9% | 0.7 | 0.9 |
| 2023-2025  | -688.0% | 74.9% | 0.6 | 1.2 |

The table shows significant volatility in CAGR and a high Beta, indicating high sensitivity to market movements.  Recent years show extremely negative CAGRs.  The alpha is generally positive, except in the most recent periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of $19.84 shows a significant jump from the previous close ($18.29). This 8.47% increase is notable and suggests a potential short-term upward trend.  However, it's crucial to note that the price is still below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting potential downside risk.  The price action could be considered a "sharp rebound" given this context.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 75.75 indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.  A positive PPO of 4.50 supports the bullish momentum indicated by the recent price jump.  The 20-day relative divergence change of +1.0 confirms a short-term upward trend. The high expected return of 9425.3% is likely unrealistic and should be viewed with extreme caution, especially given the current financial performance.  The MRI suggests low risk, but this is inconsistent with the high RSI and should be further investigated.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출       |
|------------|---------|------------|
| 2025-05-08 | -1.7    | $0.22 B    |
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13  | $0.26 B    |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31   | $0.27 B    |
| 2024-05-09 | -2.75   | $0.20 B    |
| 2025-05-08 | -2.75   | $0.20 B    |

The earnings data shows consistent and substantial losses (negative EPS) over the reported period. Revenue remains relatively stable, but the significant negative EPS demonstrates serious profitability issues.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $0.22B | 7.99% |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B | -80.66% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B | -269.19% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27B | -4.13% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.20B | -12.81% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-03-31 | $0.59B | -16.58% |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.66B | -47.53% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B | -126.03% |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B | -6.21% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.24B | -7.02% |

The financial statements reveal significant concerns.  Profit margins are heavily negative in most quarters, indicating substantial losses.  The ROE is also largely negative, pointing to poor returns on equity. The recent improvement in profit margin (Q1 2025) needs to be confirmed by future results to assess sustainability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500, exhibiting substantial losses and negative profitability. While a recent price increase shows a potential short-term rebound, the overbought RSI and the persistent negative earnings raise serious concerns. The high expected return is unrealistic given the current financial situation.  Before considering any investment, a thorough investigation into the causes of the company's financial difficulties and the sustainability of the recent price increase is crucial.  The high Beta highlights significant market risk.  Further analysis into industry trends and competitor performance is recommended before drawing any definitive conclusions.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be disregarded until further data supports such a projection.
