*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) further confirms the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy" signal might be misleading given the overwhelming negative context; it's likely based on a specific algorithm that needs to be considered alongside all other indicators.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The short-term increase in relative divergence suggests a possible short-term rise, but it is not enough to change the overall long-term negative prospects.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is alarming and suggests very high risk for long-term investors.
