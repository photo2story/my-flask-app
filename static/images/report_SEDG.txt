## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG), a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy storage solutions, has experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) in recent periods.  While showing periods of strong growth historically, the company currently exhibits negative returns and concerning financial metrics, warranting a cautious approach.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) accumulated a return of -71.51% while the S&P 500 (VOO) achieved a return of 76.92%. This represents a significant divergence of -148.4%, placing it at the 2.4th percentile of the historical range (-174.1% to 905.7%) relative to the S&P 500's performance.

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals a high beta (generally above 2), indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. While past periods show high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), recent years (2021-2025) display dramatically negative CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown), reflecting substantial losses.  The consistently high beta suggests significant market risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $11.92
* **Last Day Change:** -$1.13 (-8.66%)  This represents a significant daily drop.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.26

The price is significantly below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.38 (Below 30, indicating oversold conditions, but not necessarily a buy signal in the context of the larger downtrend)
* **PPO:** -1.22 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** 0.0 (-)  Indicates a recent lack of significant price change.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 11595.1%  This extremely high figure needs further investigation and context.  It's crucial to understand the methodology and assumptions behind this estimate, as it is likely unrealistic given the current financial state.  The high expectation is potentially due to a model adjusting for the current oversold condition assuming future correction will occur.

The large price drop (-8.66%) suggests a significant market event affecting the price.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13 | $0.26 B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31  | $0.27 B      |
| 2024-05-09 | -$2.75  | $0.20 B      |

| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08  | $0.73 B      |

There's a significant discrepancy in the November 2024 earnings data.  The large negative EPS values indicate substantial losses across recent quarters. Revenue has also fluctuated, showing inconsistency.  There is need to reconcile the repeating entries and investigate this major inconsistency in reported data.

| 2023-12-31  | $2.41B     | -6.73%       |

The financial statements reveal significant issues:  extremely negative profit margins and return on equity (ROE) across multiple quarters. This highlights severe financial distress and raises major concerns about the company's long-term viability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's performance is deeply concerning.  The substantial underperformance against the S&P 500, coupled with alarming financial results (negative profit margins, high losses, and inconsistent revenue), paints a picture of significant financial trouble.  The high beta indicates substantial risk. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, this is not necessarily a bullish signal given the fundamental weaknesses.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be viewed with extreme skepticism given the current state of the company.  Further investigation is needed to understand the discrepancies in reported data.   A long-term investment in SEDG at this time would carry exceptionally high risk.  Thorough due diligence, including analyzing the causes of the negative performance and financial issues, is critical before considering any investment.
