**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility and significant shifts in the company's performance over different periods.  Noteworthy is the drastically negative CAGR in the last three years (-740%, -627%, -648%).  The Beta consistently indicates high sensitivity to market movements, especially in recent years (reaching 1.4).  This high Beta suggests the stock’s price moves significantly more than the overall market index.  The alpha value is positive during periods of high growth in the CAGR, however more recent years show a positive alpha, reflecting outperformance compared to the market, but this is unlikely to reflect true alpha given market conditions.

* **RSI:** 26.29 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -1.28 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.5 (Short-term upward trend)

The contradictory signals from the technical indicators (oversold RSI but negative PPO) highlight the uncertainty surrounding the stock. The high Market Risk Indicator further emphasizes the volatility and risk associated with SEDG. The large price drop (-4.64%) reinforces the immediate bearish outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows consistent losses (negative EPS) over the last few quarters. Revenue has been relatively stable, but profitability is severely impacted.  The substantial jump in revenue from 2024-05-09 to 2024-11-06 needs further examination.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13 | 0.26 B$ |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31 | 0.27 B$ |

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data confirms significant issues with profitability and a concerning trend in equity.  Negative profit margins and return on equity (ROE) are serious red flags.  The drastic decline in the profit margin in Q3 2024 is particularly concerning and requires further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG is currently facing significant challenges.  The stock has substantially underperformed the market, showing consistent losses and negative profitability.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the negative PPO and high market risk indicator highlight the continued uncertainty and substantial risk.  The extremely high projected long-term return requires validation, as it appears unrealistic given the current financial state of the company.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent sharp decline in profitability and revenue and the large discrepancy in the earnings report are needed.  Before considering any investment, a thorough due diligence is crucial, including a review of the company's future prospects and the reliability of the provided data.  The data suggests the stock is currently high risk.
