Okay, here's an analysis of SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) based on the provided data.

**0) Summary of Numbers and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of the numbers, followed by analysis:

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **SEDG Overview:** SolarEdge Technologies is a company that provides power optimizer, solar inverter and monitoring solutions for photovoltaic arrays.
*   **SEDG Cumulative Return:** -74.32%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 103.01%
*   **Divergence:** -177.3
*   **Relative Divergence:** 0.0

**Analysis:** SEDG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The divergence is a large negative number, indicating SEDG's returns are drastically lower than the market benchmark. The relative divergence of 0.0 suggests this underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha     | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|-----------|------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | -74.0%   | 82.5% | -177.0%  | 0.1  | 1.7    |

*   **CAGR:**  -74.0% indicates a significant average annual loss.
*   **MDD:** 82.5% suggests very high peak-to-trough decline, meaning substantial volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** -177.0% indicates significantly underperformed compared to its benchmark. It is a risk-adjusted performance.
*   **Beta:** 0.1 implies SEDG is significantly less volatile than the market, which seems counterintuitive given the large MDD.  A beta this low suggests a disconnect between SEDG's performance and overall market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** 1.7 Billion Market capitalization

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 29.02
*   **Last Market:** Price: 29.13, Previous Close: 29.02, Change: 0.38
*   **5-day SMA:** 29.98
*   **20-day SMA:** 30.08
*   **60-day SMA:** 34.86

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day). This is generally considered a bearish signal. The shorter-term moving averages are close to each other, while the 60-day SMA is significantly higher, suggesting a downtrend over the past two months. The most recent trading day showed a small positive change, but it's not enough to reverse the overall downward trend.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 44.85
*   **PPO:** 0.52
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.2 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2340.0

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended," which seems contradictory given the other indicators. An MRI that high might be influenced by factors not immediately apparent in the provided data, or it may be an outlier.

*   The RSI of 44.85 is neutral, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The PPO of 0.52 also suggests the stock isn't too far from its moving averages.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying with all available cash but notes it's "Very Safe" based on the MRI, creating further conflict.
*   The negative divergence change confirms recent underperformance.
*   The extremely negative expected return of -2340.0% is alarming and strongly suggests significant downside risk according to the model calculating this value.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Multiple articles highlight concerns about SolarEdge, including revenue declines, market dissatisfaction, and a significant drop after an earnings report.
*   **Analyst Upgrade (Morgan Stanley):** Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to "Equalweight," suggesting a neutral stance, which indicates they don't expect significant outperformance or underperformance.
*   **Spotting Winners:** At least one article (TradingView) mentioned SolarEdge in the context of renewable energy stocks, but this may be a broader sector overview rather than a specific endorsement.

**Analysis:** The news sentiment appears predominantly negative, with concerns about the company's financial performance and market reception.  The analyst upgrade to "Equalweight" provides a glimmer of hope but is far from a strong buy signal.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (3.30)
*   **Target Price:** 32.65 (Avg)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not specified.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," indicating a lack of strong conviction in either direction. The average target price of $32.65 is slightly higher than the current price, suggesting potential upside, but the range between high ($44.00) and low ($17.00) target prices is wide, implying considerable uncertainty among analysts.  The absence of recent rating changes limits insight into the very latest analyst perspectives.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.84  | 0.34 B$     |
| 2025-08-07 | -2.13  | 0.29 B$     |
| 2025-05-08 | -1.7   | 0.22 B$     |
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13 | 0.24 B$     |
| 2025-11-06 | -21.58 | 0.24 B$     |

**Analysis:** SolarEdge has consistently reported negative EPS (Earnings Per Share). Revenue has fluctuated but generally shows a decreasing trend in the most recent quarters. The EPS values are deeply negative, which are extremely concerning. It is unclear why it is showing the same 2 dates (2025-11-06) with extremely negative EPS values.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |

| 2025-06-30   | $0.29B    | 11.10%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.22B    | 7.99%         |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B    | -80.66%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.48B    | -10.43%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.51B    | -24.31%   |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.96B    | -128.69%  |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been fluctuating, and while the recent profit margins are positive, they follow quarters with very negative profit margins. This suggests inconsistency and potential challenges in maintaining profitability. The Equity has been decreasing, and the ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating profits from shareholder investments.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Based on the provided data, SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) is facing significant challenges.

*   **Underperformance:** SEDG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Financial Weakness:**  Negative earnings, fluctuating revenue, negative ROE, and declining equity raise concerns about the company's financial health. The incredibly negative expected return is a major red flag.
*   **Negative Sentiment:** Recent news is primarily negative, reflecting market concerns about the company's performance and outlook.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analyst consensus is "Hold," with a wide range of target prices, indicating a lack of clear direction.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The high MRI contradicts other negative indicators, making it unreliable.
*   **Volatility:** High MDD suggests a risky investment.

**Conclusion:**

The data paints a concerning picture of SolarEdge. While the MRI suggests high investment, almost every other indicator points to substantial risk and potential further downside. A very cautious approach is warranted. It is best to examine the MRI further to determine if it is an accurate calculation.
