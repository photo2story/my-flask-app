Solaredge Technologies Inc. is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), SEDG has significantly underperformed, with a cumulative return of -56.65% versus VOO's 112.44%. This represents a substantial difference of -169.1%.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility and fluctuating beta (market sensitivity).  High beta values (e.g., 16.5, 18.8) in some periods suggest significant sensitivity to market movements, while the recent low betas (0.8, 1.1) indicate reduced market sensitivity, possibly due to industry-specific factors or diversification.  Alpha, while positive in some periods, hasn't consistently outperformed the market.  The dramatic negative CAGR in recent years (-694%, -621%, -736%) is particularly concerning.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 82.0%    | 15.0%    | 0.1   | 2.2   |        |

| 2017-2019  | 289.0%   | 20.6%    | 0.3   | 5.6   |        |
| 2018-2020  | 843.0%   | 34.1%    | 0.1   | 18.8  |        |
| 2019-2021  | 597.0%   | 34.1%    | 0.1   | 16.5  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 342.0%   | 34.1%    | 0.1   | 16.6  |        |
| 2021-2023  | -694.0%  | 41.2%    | 0.8   | 5.5   |        |
| 2022-2024  | -621.0%  | 48.0%    | 0.8   | 0.8   |        |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $17.89
* **Previous Close:** $18.54
* **5-day Moving Average:** $18.25
* **20-day Moving Average:** $15.76
* **60-day Moving Average:** $14.74

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The recent price drop of -3.5% from the previous close indicates a short-term negative momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (63.32):** Suggests the stock is not currently overbought, but approaching the overbought zone (typically above 70).
* **PPO (1.83):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Divergence:** A positive change of 0.7 suggests a short-term upward trend.  Given the significant recent price drop (-3.5%), this short-term uptrend is likely a bounce and does not necessarily negate the long-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return (17862.4%):** This extremely high figure requires further investigation and clarification of its calculation methodology.  It is highly unusual and likely unrealistic without strong supporting evidence and assumptions about future growth.  Caution is warranted.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant losses in recent quarters.  Revenue fluctuates but does not show consistent growth. The repeated -1.08 EPS and $0.73B revenue entry suggests an error in the data provided.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue      |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13   | $0.26B       |

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability show significant issues.  Negative profit margins consistently point towards unsustainable operations.  ROE is also deeply negative, indicating substantial losses relative to shareholder equity.  The large swings in equity also raise concerns.  A thorough investigation into the underlying causes of these negative trends is necessary.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG's performance has been extremely poor compared to the S&P 500.  Financial statements reveal significant losses and negative profitability.  While some technical indicators hint at short-term upward potential, the underlying fundamentals raise serious concerns.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return needs significant validation.  Before considering any investment, a thorough review of the company's strategy, competitive landscape, and potential for a turnaround is crucial.  The data provided suggests a high-risk investment with significant potential for further losses.  Further investigation is warranted to understand the reasons behind the negative performance and the discrepancies in the provided data before making any investment decisions.
