*   **RSI:** 72.50 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.7669
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (24 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)"
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (Neutral)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 18830.7% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates low market risk, but the RSI is in overbought territory, suggesting a possible pullback in the short term.
*   The PPO is positive, supporting the uptrend indicated by the moving averages.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests buying 80% with remaining cash and recommending caution due to MRI value.
*   The very high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism. This is likely a model output based on past performance and may not be indicative of future results, especially given the recent negative performance. A 2-year return of 18830.7% is unrealistic. The model is expecting the market to correct it self.
