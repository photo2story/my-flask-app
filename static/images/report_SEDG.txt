## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.  The cumulative return for SEDG is -66.09%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 127.0%.  This represents a significant underperformance of SEDG compared to the market benchmark. The difference in cumulative returns is -193.09%, placing it at the 49th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This means its current underperformance is worse than approximately half of the observed historical periods of comparison.

The provided CAGR data shows periods of substantial growth alongside recent significant declines.  The high betas across most periods demonstrate sensitivity to broader market movements, and the recent negative CAGR coupled with a high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights significant volatility and risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $11.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $17.70

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent price of $13.77 is near the 5-day moving average but significantly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, hinting at a potential rebound but also indicating a downward trend in the recent past.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 32.51 (Suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a short-term bounce, but not necessarily a long-term reversal).
* **PPO:** 0.15 (A positive value, albeit small, indicates potential upward momentum but needs further confirmation).
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.08 (Indicates a recent short-term increase in relative strength).

The $13.77 price doesn't directly signal a sharp rebound or decline without considering broader market context and news events. The expected return of 0.0% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 implies that the investment is not expected to outperform the market index over this horizon based on the current data and projections.  This suggests significant risk and uncertainty in projecting future returns.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows significant losses, particularly in the most recent quarters.  The negative EPS figures across all reported periods raise serious concerns about the company's financial health. The substantial decrease in revenue from Q3 2023 ($0.73B) to subsequent quarters further amplifies these concerns.  There is no mention of analyst consensus estimates in the provided data to properly compare the recent earnings to expectations.  Without this information, a complete assessment of recent performance relative to predictions cannot be made.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals significant volatility and profitability challenges.  The extremely high negative profit margins in recent quarters indicate a severe operational issue impacting revenue and profitability. Negative ROE values across multiple quarters point to a return on investment significantly below expectations, raising doubts about management's effectiveness.  The large swing from positive profitability to drastic losses requires further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:** The report lacks crucial information, such as recent news articles (from sources like Shacknews or FINBOLD) that would provide insights into recent market outlooks, analyst opinions, performance highlights, and any potential catalysts driving the stock's performance.  This is a critical gap in the analysis.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

SEDG is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500, showing a consistent decline in recent periods.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but this does not guarantee a sustained reversal. Financial results are alarming, indicating operational issues and significant losses.  The absence of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more complete assessment of the current market sentiment and outlook.  Without access to this information, the risks inherent in investing in SEDG appear substantial, particularly given the current financial position and its significant sensitivity to market fluctuations.


**8. Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, a cautious approach is warranted. The significant underperformance, alarming financial results, and lack of crucial news and analyst data create considerable uncertainty and risk.  Further research is critical before considering any investment in SEDG.  A thorough analysis of the reasons behind the recent financial losses and an outlook from reputable financial analysts would be necessary to formulate a well-informed investment decision.  Considering the provided information alone, investment in SEDG at this time is highly discouraged.
