*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 29.88

**Analysis:** The stock price has increased significantly, closing above its 5-day, 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This indicates a potential short-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended - *contextually important*).  **Important Note:** Given the other negative factors, this MRI should be viewed with caution.  It *might* suggest the stock is oversold or undervalued *if* the company's fundamentals were stronger. In this case, it may be a short-term signal.
*   **RSI:** 64.74 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting the recent price increase may be unsustainable).
*   **PPO:** 1.35 (Positive, indicating upward momentum but not extremely overbought).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (783 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-19) This recommendation is risky given the current data and is based primarily on the Market Risk Indicator.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** 0.0 (-): Short-term decline in relative performance.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1295.8 (Extremely negative, suggesting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon).

**Analysis:** While the MRI suggests a potentially positive outlook, the extremely negative expected return and RSI approaching overbought levels warrant caution. The "Hybrid Signal" should be carefully evaluated in light of the other negative indicators. The recent price increase (change of 4.09) could be a short-term bounce, but doesn't negate the longer-term concerns.
