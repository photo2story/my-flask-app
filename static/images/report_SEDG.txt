**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows very volatile performance, with periods of extremely high growth (e.g., 2018-2020, 2019-2021) followed by significant declines (2021-2025).  The recent CAGR figures are deeply negative.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values are high, indicating substantial peak-to-trough declines in the stock price during the specified periods. This suggests high risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the excess return compared to a benchmark. The significantly negative Alpha in recent periods indicates substantial underperformance relative to the expected return based on the stock's beta.
*   **Beta:**  Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. Beta values close to 1 or slightly above suggest that SEDG's price tends to move in the same direction as the market, but potentially with slightly higher volatility.  The earlier negative Betas are unusual.
*   **Cap(B):**  This represents the market capitalization in Billions.  Note the significant decline in market cap in recent years, reflecting the poor performance.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 25.55
*   **Previous Close:** 25.66
*   **Change:** -0.43
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 25.81
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 26.97
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 21.77

**Analysis:**

The current price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day moving average, which is considered a short-term bearish signal. The 20-day moving average is above the 60-day moving average, which is a medium-term bullish signal, but the price is struggling to stay above the 20-day. Overall, the price action is mixed but leaning bearish.  Given the negative change from the previous close, this reinforces the downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3358 (Low Risk - Middle Range)
*   **RSI:** 46.75
*   **PPO:** -2.46
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_68%_Sell 2.7% of holdings (14 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 68% on 2025-08-01)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** -0.2 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 12077.9

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests low to middle risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 46.75 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of -2.46 indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is a cautious one. It suggests holding a significant amount of cash (68%), selling a small portion of holdings, and making small monthly investments.  The caution is warranted given the MRI.
*   **Recent Relative Deviation Change:** The negative change in relative deviation confirms short-term underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (12077.9%) is likely an anomaly or the result of a specific model calculation. It's highly improbable and should be viewed with extreme skepticism. It might be projecting a very long-term recovery, but it's not a realistic near-term expectation. Given the 'change' value of -0.43, there may be some volatility in the stock recently.

The mention of "major business developments, regulatory changes, or market events" suggests potential catalysts for the stock's movement.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출       |
| :--------- | :------ | :--------- |
| 2025-05-08 | -1.7    | 0.22 B$    |

| 2025-05-08 | -2.75   | 0.20 B$    |

**Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistently negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) over the recent quarters.  The EPS figures are particularly concerning, with a large negative value in 2024-11-07.  Revenue has been fluctuating but remains relatively low. The negative EPS suggests the company is struggling with profitability.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
| :--------- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.22B     | 7.99%          |

| :--------- | :--------- | :-------- |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.59B     | -16.58%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.66B     | -47.53%   |

| 2024-03-31 | $2.24B     | -7.02%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** While revenue has been fluctuating, the profit margins are deeply negative for most quarters. This confirms the company's struggle with profitability, as highlighted in the earnings analysis.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been declining significantly over the past year, indicating potential financial strain. The negative ROE (Return on Equity) values further reinforce the lack of profitability and inefficient use of equity. The decline in equity is a major red flag.

**7. Overall Analysis**

SEDG is facing significant challenges. The stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, and recent financial data reveals consistent losses, declining equity, and high volatility. News reports suggest major events are impacting the company, requiring careful monitoring. While the MRI indicates low risk, all other indicators point to very high risk. The extraordinarily high "Expected Return" should be disregarded as unrealistic. The Hybrid Signal confirms caution is warranted. The company's long-term potential within the renewable energy sector may exist, but the current financial situation demands extreme caution. Further investigation into the specific "major business developments, regulatory changes, or market events" is crucial to understanding the potential for recovery or further decline.
