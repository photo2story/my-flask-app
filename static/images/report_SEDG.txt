| 2023-2025  | -701.0% | 74.9% | -716.0% | 0.6 | 0.7 |

The table shows high volatility and inconsistent performance.  While several periods exhibit strong CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), the recent years show significant negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The beta, generally above 1, suggests higher volatility than the market.  Alpha, while often positive in earlier periods, recently became substantially negative.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.35

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent 1.2% increase may indicate a short-term bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.6 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -1.8 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** 10388% (This extremely high figure needs further explanation and context.  It's likely an error or based on assumptions not fully disclosed.)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While RSI and PPO suggest bearish sentiment, the positive relative divergence change hints at a short-term price recovery. The extremely high expected return requires clarification.  A 1.2% daily price increase is notable, but doesn't necessarily signal a significant trend reversal.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13   | $0.26B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31    | $0.27B      |
| 2024-05-09 | -$2.75    | $0.20B      |
| 2023-11-06 | -$1.08    | $0.73B      |
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08    | $0.73B      | *(Note: Duplicate entry)*

There's a significant discrepancy in November 2024 EPS and Revenue. The data needs clarification and correction.  Overall, recent earnings show substantial losses.  Revenue has also decreased.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.66B    | -47.53%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B    | -126.03%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B    | -6.21%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.24B    | -7.02%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.41B    | -6.73%        |


The financial statements reveal significant losses and negative profit margins across most quarters.  ROE (Return on Equity) is also consistently negative, indicating poor profitability.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

SEDG is currently experiencing significant challenges.  The substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative earnings, and negative profit margins paint a concerning picture. While some short-term indicators might suggest a potential bounce, the overall trend is bearish.  The provided expected return of 10388% is highly improbable and needs further justification.  Before considering any investment, a thorough review of the corrected financial data and an assessment of the underlying business fundamentals are necessary. The high volatility and recent negative performance highlight significant risk.  Further investigation is needed to determine the reasons for the substantial underperformance.  Discrepancies in the provided data must be resolved before drawing conclusive insights.
