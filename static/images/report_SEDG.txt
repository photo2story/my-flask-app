**Analysis:**
*   **CAGR:**  The historical performance shows significant volatility. Recent years (2021-2025) have seen substantial negative returns.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values (65.9% - 86.7%) indicate significant risk.
*   **Alpha:**  The negative Alpha in recent periods suggests SEDG has consistently underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally low, especially in earlier periods, suggesting SEDG's price is not highly correlated with the overall market. However, the Beta has increased in recent years (0.6 - 0.9), indicating a growing correlation with the market.
*   **Cap:** Market capitalization has decreased substantially, going from 18.9B to 1.6B

**2. Recent Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 26.46
*   **Previous Close:** 25.1

*   **5-day Moving Average:** 25.164
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 26.4862
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 22.6418

**Analysis:** The recent price increase of 5.42% is a noteworthy short-term trend. The current price is slightly below the 20-day moving average but well above the 60-day moving average. This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but further observation is needed. The significant 'change' from the previous close indicates a potentially volatile situation.

**3. Market Risk Indicators**

*   **RSI:** 38.87
*   **PPO:** -1.34

*   **20-day Relative Deviation Change:** -0.4 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 22111.2% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**
*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.3234 indicates a low-risk market environment based on the MRI.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 38.87 suggests the stock is nearing oversold conditions, which could indicate a potential buying opportunity, but further confirmation is needed.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a possible downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending a significant cash position and selling a small portion of holdings.
*   **Relative Deviation:** The recent decrease in relative deviation implies a short-term decline in SEDG's performance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (22111.2%) is very unusual and should be treated with extreme caution. It likely reflects some anomaly in the calculation or the model's attempt to predict a rebound from a severely undervalued position. However, it's highly speculative and should not be the primary basis for investment decisions.

**Analysis:**
*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been volatile. Profit margins are concerning, with very large negative values in late 2024. While recent quarters show a positive profit margin, the overall trend is unstable.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has decreased significantly over the past year. ROE is negative for all periods, indicating that the company is not generating profits from its equity. The extremely negative ROE in 2024-09-30 is a significant red flag.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

SEDG is in a challenging situation. It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with recent negative earnings and declining financial health indicators.

*   **Key Concerns:**
    *   Sustained losses (negative EPS).
    *   Decreasing equity and negative ROE.
    *   High volatility and uncertainty reflected in recent news.
    *   A concerning trend in short-term price and performance.

*   **Potential Positives:**
    *   Recent price increase and nearing oversold RSI suggest a potential short-term rebound.
    *   Analysts are actively discussing the company, indicating attention and potential catalysts.
    *   The company is still a leader in its industry.

*   **Investment Recommendation:** Given the negative financials, underperformance, and volatility, a **very cautious approach** is warranted. The hybrid signal reflects this, advising a high cash position and selling a small portion of holdings. While the extremely high expected return might be tempting, it should be viewed skeptically. Investors should thoroughly research the company, closely monitor its earnings reports and news releases, and consider the high risk before making any investment decisions.
