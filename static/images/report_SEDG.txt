## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Stock Review

**0. Overview:** Solaredge Technologies Inc. is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy storage solutions.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

SEDG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period.  While VOO shows a cumulative return of 65.37%, SEDG exhibits a cumulative loss of -70.26%.  The resulting divergence is -135.6 percentage points, placing it at the 2.4th percentile of the historical divergence range (-161.0 to 913.7).  This indicates SEDG's performance is substantially below that of the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta data show high volatility and varying market sensitivity.  While periods of high positive alpha and beta (2017-2020) suggest strong outperformance and high market correlation, the recent periods (2021-2025) show drastically negative CAGR, indicating significant underperformance, despite relatively high beta indicating high correlation.  This suggests a potential shift in market sentiment towards SEDG or challenges faced by the company itself.  Note that the extremely negative CAGRs in the recent years are likely outliers which should not be solely relied upon.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 68.0% | 62.3% | 43.0% | -0.1 | 2.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 18.0% | 66.2% | 0.0% | -0.0 | 2.1 |
| 2017-2019  | 227.0% | 66.2% | 199.0% | 0.2 | 5.6 |
| 2018-2020  | 787.0% | 86.8% | 762.0% | 0.2 | 18.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 657.0% | 86.8% | 604.0% | 0.2 | 16.5 |

| 2023-2025  | -700.0% | 74.9% | 0.6 | 0.8 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $14.35, a significant increase of 15.87% compared to the previous close ($12.385).  However, this needs to be put in context with the moving averages:  The stock is below its 5-day ($14.044), 20-day ($15.943), and 60-day ($15.479) moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downward trend despite the recent jump.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 indicates a high-risk environment.
* **RSI:** 34.91 suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity, but further analysis is needed.
* **PPO:** -2.4851 points towards bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** The recent increase in relative strength (0.6) might signal a short-term upward correction.
* **Price Change:** The 15.87% increase from the previous close is substantial and suggests a sudden upward movement (a "sharp bounce"), potentially a short term trend reversal,  but it's too early to confirm a long-term trend shift based on one day's data.
* **Expected Return:** 12420.4% is an extremely high projected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), which seems unrealistic without further supporting analysis or context of how this number was derived. This figure needs serious scrutiny.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant losses over several quarters.  Revenue has remained relatively stable, but the negative EPS and extremely low profit margins are alarming.  There is a repeated entry for 2024-11-07, suggesting a data entry error.

| 날짜       | EPS      | 매출          |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -21.13    | 0.26 B$       |
| 2024-08-07 | -2.31     | 0.27 B$       |
| 2024-05-09 | -2.75     | 0.20 B$       |
| 2023-11-06 | -1.08     | 0.73 B$       |
| 2024-11-07 | -1.08     | 0.73 B$       |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial statements confirm a worrying trend.  Revenue is inconsistent, and profit margins are deeply negative in most quarters, implying significant operational issues.  Equity has fluctuated, and ROE is largely negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its investments.  The extremely negative profit margins in Q3 2024 are particularly concerning.

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B | -80.66% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B | -269.19% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27B | -4.13% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.20B | -12.81% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.32B | -17.85% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.66B | -47.53% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B | -126.03% |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B | -6.21% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.24B | -7.02% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.41B | -6.73% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG is currently experiencing significant challenges.  While the recent price jump might offer a short-term opportunity for some investors (considering the oversold RSI and the sharp bounce), the long-term outlook is uncertain given consistent losses, deeply negative profit margins, and considerable underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The exceptionally high projected return needs further justification.  Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence, analyze the reasons for the recent poor performance, and consider the broader macroeconomic factors impacting the solar energy sector.  The provided data suggests high risk and potential for further losses.  More investigation into the reasons behind the negative earnings and fluctuating equity is necessary. The questionable 12420.4% expected return needs to be addressed by clarifying its source and assumptions.
