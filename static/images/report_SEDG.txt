**Analysis:**

*   **Early Growth (2015-2020):** The data shows extremely high CAGR and Alpha values, indicating significant outperformance during this period. Beta around 1.0 suggests the stock moved in line with the market.
*   **Recent Decline (2021-2025):** More recently, CAGR and Alpha have become deeply negative, signaling substantial underperformance. A Beta close to 0 suggests the stock's performance has become decoupled from the broader market. The drop in Cap (Market Capitalization) reflects this decline in investor confidence and stock value.
*   **High MDD:** The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant volatility and risk associated with SEDG.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 31.99
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 31.99, Previous Close: 34.30, Change: -6.73% (Significant negative change)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 32.11
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 27.64
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 24.35

**Analysis:** The stock is trading below its 5-day moving average but above its 20 and 60-day moving averages.  The recent sharp decline (-6.73%) is concerning and suggests immediate negative pressure. This recent drop needs to be examined in context with the news and earning data.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expectations**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3237 (Low Risk) -  Indicates a relatively low-risk market environment currently.
*   **RSI:** 65.25 - Approaching overbought territory (above 70), suggesting potential for a pullback.
*   **PPO:** 1.85 - Positive, indicating upward momentum, but should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) - This signal suggests a cautious buy recommendation.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.5 (+) - Indicates a short-term increase in relative performance.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 17687.2% -  Extremely high expected return, indicating significant potential outperformance over the S&P 500 in the long term *if* the company can turn around. This number should be viewed with extreme skepticism.

**Analysis:** The indicators present a mixed picture. The MRI suggests low market risk, but the RSI nearing overbought levels, along with the recent price drop, indicates potential for a short-term correction.  The extremely high "Expected Return" is not realistic given the current financial challenges and should be heavily discounted. The recent negative change in price requires further analysis of news and earning.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출         |
| :--------- | :----- | :----------- |
| 2025-08-07 | -2.13  | 0.29 B$      |
| 2025-05-08 | -1.7   | 0.22 B$      |

| 2025-08-07 | -2.31  | 0.27 B$      |

**Analysis:**  SEDG is experiencing significant earnings difficulties. The consistently negative EPS figures are a major red flag. The large loss reported on 2024-11-07 is particularly concerning. While revenue appears somewhat stable, it's clearly not translating into profitability.

**6. Financial Information**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| :---------- | :------- | :------------- |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.29B  | 11.10%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.22B  | 7.99%         |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B  | -80.66%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B  | -269.19%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27B  | -4.13%        |

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE       |
| :---------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.51B   | -24.31%  |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.59B   | -16.58%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.66B   | -47.53%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.96B   | -126.03% |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.11B   | -6.21%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has fluctuated, but the key concern is the consistently negative profit margins. The extremely negative profit margins in Q3 and Q4 2024 are alarming. While there appears to have been some rebound in 2025, the situation still warrants caution.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has significantly decreased over the past year, indicating a reduction in the company's net worth. The consistently negative ROE figures further highlight the company's inability to generate profits from its equity.

**7. Overall Assessment**

SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) faces significant challenges. While it once showed strong growth, recent financial performance is poor, as evidenced by negative earnings, declining equity, and negative profit margins. The stock has significantly underperformed the market. Although technical indicators show mixed signals, the fundamental picture raises concerns.

**Recommendation:**  Given the negative earnings, concerning financial trends, and recent price volatility, a **SELL** or **AVOID** rating is warranted. Investors should closely monitor upcoming news, earnings reports, and any company announcements regarding restructuring or strategic changes. The long-term "Expected Return" is not realistic in the current context.
