**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

SEDG, Solaredge Technologies Inc., is a leading provider of solar inverters and power optimizers.  The provided data shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **SEDG Cumulative Return:** -71.61%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 80.53%
* **Return Difference:** -152.1% (This indicates SEDG significantly underperformed VOO.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 2.0% (This indicates that the current underperformance is near the lower end of the historical range of divergence between SEDG and VOO.)

The provided CAGR data reveals significant volatility in SEDG's performance over the years,  with periods of extremely high growth followed by substantial declines.  The recent negative CAGRs are particularly alarming. The beta values suggest high sensitivity to market movements (above 1). The alpha values vary widely and are negative for recent periods, indicating underperformance compared to the market.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) also shows significant fluctuation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $11.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.29
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.24

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent closing price shows a -1.72% decrease from the previous close, indicating a further downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.22 (Below 40, indicating oversold conditions but not a strong buy signal.)
* **PPO:** -1.25 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.7 (Short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** 13939.7% (This extremely high figure needs further clarification. It seems improbable and might reflect a miscalculation or flawed model.  Further scrutiny of the methodology is required).  The extreme value likely does not reflect realistic market expectations.

The recent price drop of -1.72% indicates a short-term downward trend. However, oversold conditions (RSI < 40) warrant further investigation, but don't guarantee a recovery.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistently negative EPS over the reported quarters, with a significant decline in revenue in the last two quarters.  There's a discrepancy in the data;  2024-11-07 appears twice with identical figures, requiring clarification. This trend is extremely concerning and signals serious financial distress.


| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13 | $0.26 B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31  | $0.27 B      |
| 2024-05-09 | -$2.75  | $0.20 B      |
| 2023-11-06 | -$1.08  | $0.73 B      |
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08  | $0.73 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability show significant deterioration, with significantly negative profit margins and ROE. The high negative ROE indicates poor management of equity.  The large swings in equity (from $2.41B to $0.66B) are alarming, reflecting a major financial concern.


| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE       |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B    | -80.66%       | $0.66B    | -47.53%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.26B    | -269.19%      | $0.96B    | -126.03%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.27B    | -4.13%        | $2.11B    | -6.21%    |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.20B    | -12.81%       | $2.24B    | -7.02%    |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.32B    | -17.85%       | $2.41B    | -6.73%    |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SEDG's performance is deeply concerning. The negative earnings, extremely low profitability, declining revenue, significantly negative ROE and high negative CAGR values strongly indicate substantial financial distress.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the underlying fundamentals are severely weak.  The extremely high predicted return should be dismissed due to a lack of reasonable explanation.  Currently, SEDG presents significant risk and  a long-term investment decision should be made only after a thorough investigation of the root causes of its financial struggles and prospects for turnaround.  The current data suggests a high probability of further decline.  This analysis requires further investigation to confirm the reliability of the data provided.  In particular, the duplicated 2024-11-07 entry and the extremely high expected return require immediate clarification.
