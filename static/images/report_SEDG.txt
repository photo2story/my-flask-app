## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy management solutions.  Its cumulative return is reported as 'nan' (not a number), indicating missing data or an inability to calculate a return based on the provided information.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 121.38%, SEDG shows a significant negative divergence.  The provided divergence metrics (-191.8, relative divergence 0.1) further highlight SEDG's underperformance relative to the market, though the meaning of these max/min values isn't entirely clear without additional context.


**2. Recent Stock Price:**

The last closing price for SEDG is $12.78, a decrease from the last market price of $14.28.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals a concerning trend for SEDG:

* **Latest Quarterly Results Comparison:** The most recent quarter (ending 2024-11-07) shows a substantial EPS loss of -$21.13, significantly worse than the previous quarter's -$2.31.  This represents a dramatic deterioration in profitability.

* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue fluctuates between $0.20B and $0.27B in the last three quarters, showing a lack of significant growth. The significant jump in revenue to $0.73B in the quarter ending 2023-09-30 appears to be an outlier and is not sustained.

* **EPS Trends and Significant Changes:** EPS is consistently negative in the last five quarters, with a drastic worsening in the most recent quarter. The significant drop from -$2.31 to -$21.13 is alarming.

* **Beats or Misses:**  Without access to analysts' expectations, it is impossible to determine if the reported earnings were beats or misses.  However, the drastic EPS decline in the latest quarter is clearly negative.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data shows a worrying picture of SEDG's financial health:

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is erratic, with a significant drop from Q3 2023 to subsequent quarters. Profit margins are deeply negative in the last three quarters, reaching -269.19% in Q3 2024 â€“ likely an error given profit margins can't normally exceed 100%.  This strongly suggests major accounting issues or errors in the data. The high positive profit margin of 19.69% in Q3 2023 appears unsustainable given subsequent performance.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has declined from $2.49B in Q3 2023 to $0.96B in Q3 2024, indicating significant financial distress. ROE is consistently negative, further highlighting the company's inability to generate profits from its equity. The -126.03% ROE in Q3 2024 is clearly an error and needs further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news is provided.  Information on market outlook and analyst opinions is also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Solaredge Technologies (SEDG) exhibits extremely concerning financial performance.  The dramatic drop in EPS, inconsistent revenue, deeply negative profit margins, declining equity, and negative ROE all point to severe financial distress.  The large discrepancies in the reported figures (e.g., -269% profit margin) raise serious concerns about the accuracy of the provided data.   The provided data suggests potential accounting errors or other issues warranting further investigation before any investment decisions are made.  Without additional information (e.g., analyst expectations, news articles, complete and accurate financial statements),  a thorough and reliable assessment is impossible. The severe underperformance relative to the S&P 500 adds to the negative outlook.  The "nan" cumulative return further emphasizes the lack of clarity and the need for more complete information.

It is not financial advice, and independent verification of the data and further research are crucial before making any investment decisions.
