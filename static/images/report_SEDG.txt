| 2023-2025  | -364.0%   | 82.5%    | -430.0%  | -0.1   | 1.7    |

    *Analysis:* The table reveals a significant decline in performance in recent years. While past periods (2018-2020) showed exceptional CAGR and Alpha, the more recent periods (2021-2025) demonstrate substantial negative CAGR and Alpha, accompanied by high Maximum Drawdown (MDD). The Beta fluctuates but generally indicates moderate correlation with the market. The market capitalization has also significantly decreased.

    *Analysis:* Revenue has increased, and profit margins, while positive in the most recent quarters, were deeply negative in late 2024. Equity has steadily declined, and ROE is negative, indicating poor profitability and inefficient use of shareholder equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) presents a concerning picture. The stock has significantly underperformed the market. Recent earnings reports show negative EPS and fluctuating revenue. Profitability metrics, including negative ROE and deeply negative profit margins in the recent past, raise serious concerns about the company's financial health.

While the Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a high investment recommendation, this conflicts sharply with the extremely negative expected return and negative trends exhibited from the tables provided. Recent news headlines reflect the stock's volatility and negative performance. Analyst consensus is neutral ("Hold"), but the wide range in target prices indicates uncertainty.

**Overall Conclusion:** Based on the data provided, investing in SEDG carries high risk. While the technology may have long-term potential, the current financial performance and market sentiment suggest caution. The negative earnings, declining equity, negative ROE, and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 warrant careful consideration before making any investment decisions. The data clearly indicates a need for a turnaround strategy and a significant improvement in financial performance before the stock can be considered a viable investment.
