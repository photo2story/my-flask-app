## Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar power optimization and energy storage solutions.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), SEDG has significantly underperformed. The cumulative return difference between SEDG and VOO as of the last data point is -287.3 (-66.51% + 120.8%).  The provided relative divergence of -187.3 suggests SEDG's performance is substantially below the S&P 500, ranking in the lower 5% percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR data shows periods of extremely high growth followed by dramatic declines, highlighting the volatility inherent in this investment. The Beta values, ranging from 1.0 to 18.0, indicate a high sensitivity to market movements, especially during periods of high growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $14.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $12.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $16.89

The price is currently above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting some potential upward momentum but also a longer-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (65.26):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (1.97):**  A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.3, indicating a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0%.  This suggests that given the current circumstances and the company's recent performance, there is no expectation of outperformance against the S&P 500 in the long term without a significant change in the business fundamentals. The extremely negative alpha values in recent years support this conclusion. The $14.28 closing price is not extreme enough to suggest an immediate sharp reversal (either up or down) based on this data alone. Further analysis would be required.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent quarterly earnings show a concerning trend:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuating, with a significant drop from $0.73B in Q3 2023 to $0.26B in Q3 2024.  This represents a substantial decline in revenue.
* **EPS:** Consistently negative, with a particularly large loss of -$21.13 in the most recent quarter (Q3 2024).  This is a massive loss compared to previous quarters. There is a potential data entry error as the Q3 2024 result repeats the prior year's Q3.  Clarification is needed on this discrepancy.
* **Profit Margin:**  Severely negative in recent quarters, highlighting significant losses, with the exception of Q3 2023 showing a positive 19.69% profit margin.

There is no information provided to assess whether these results beat or missed expectations.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG has severely underperformed the S&P 500, showing a significant and prolonged decline in recent periods.  Technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term pullback, even if recent price action shows a slight upward trend. Financial performance is alarming, with substantial revenue declines and consistent losses.  The lack of positive news and analyst opinion data paints a gloomy picture.  The extremely negative alpha values highlight the severe underperformance relative to the market. Based solely on the provided data, this investment appears to be very high-risk and shows no promise of outperforming the market in the foreseeable future.  Further investigation into the cause of the dramatic Q3 2024 losses, the potential data error in the earnings report, and a more comprehensive market analysis are crucial before considering any investment.
