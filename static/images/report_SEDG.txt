**Recommendation:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is warranted. The Hybrid Signal suggests a very small allocation. Investors should closely monitor upcoming earnings reports and company announcements for signs of improvement. The high "Expected Return" should be viewed with skepticism until the company demonstrates sustained profitability and improved financial health. The significant recent price increase should also be viewed cautiously, as it may be a short-term correction rather than a sustained recovery.
