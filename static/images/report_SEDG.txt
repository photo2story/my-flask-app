| 2020-2022  | 165.0%   | 80.0%   | 166.0%  | 0.5   | 16.8    |
| 2021-2023  | -474.0%  | 79.3%   | -475.0% | 0.5   | 5.6     |
| 2022-2024  | -312.0%  | 79.3%   | -332.0% | 0.3   | 0.8     |
| 2023-2025  | -359.0%  | 82.5%   | -423.0% | -0.1  | 2.1     |

*   **Analysis:** The table reveals a significant decline in performance in recent years.  CAGR has plummeted, and Alpha has turned sharply negative, indicating underperformance relative to the market.  Beta values are relatively low, suggesting the stock is less volatile than the overall market, but the negative Alpha overwhelms any potential benefit. Max Drawdown remains high, showing substantial risk.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 35.66
*   **Previous Close:** 35.55
*   **Change:** 0.31
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day: 36.5
    *   20-day: 35.52
    *   60-day: 31.22

*   **Analysis:** The stock is slightly up in the most recent session.  The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day, which is above the 60-day. This *could* signal a potential short-term upward trend, but needs to be viewed cautiously in light of the other negative indicators.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 52.39
*   **PPO:** -1.10
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (26 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** -0.6 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 1468.5% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI of 0.9 suggests the investment is highly recommended.  This is contradictory to much of the other data and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.
    *   RSI is near neutral.
    *   PPO is negative, indicating the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average (bearish signal).
    *   The negative change in relative deviation confirms a recent underperformance trend.
    *   The incredibly high "Expected Return" seems unrealistic and is likely based on a model that is not adequately capturing the current risks and negative trends.

    **Important:** The positive MRI and extremely high expected return are *highly suspect* given all the other negative data. It's crucial to understand the methodology behind these numbers and treat them with extreme caution. The price change of 0.31 is relatively small and does not indicate a significant short-term event.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative News:** Several recent news headlines are negative:
    *   Lowered target price from Argus Research ($28.00).
    *   Articles highlighting stock declines and underperformance.
    *   Article discussing potential fair value estimates.

*   **Analyst Opinions:**
    *   Consensus: Hold
    *   Mean: 3.39 (~Hold)
    *   Target Price (avg/high/low): 25.10 / 41.00 / 9.00
    *   The analyst consensus is "Hold," but the average target price ($25.10) is *significantly below* the current price (35.66), suggesting potential downside risk. The low target price of $9.00 is particularly concerning.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue    |
| :---------- | :------- | :--------- |
| 2025-08-07 | -2.13   | 0.29 B$    |
| 2025-05-08 | -1.7    | 0.22 B$    |

| 2025-08-07 | -2.31   | 0.27 B$    |

*   **Analysis:**  The EPS (Earnings Per Share) figures are consistently negative and, in one quarter, dramatically so. Revenue is relatively stable but not enough to offset the losses. This is a major red flag.

    *   Equity has been declining sharply.
    *   ROE (Return on Equity) is deeply negative, reflecting poor profitability.

**7. 종합 분석 (Summary):**

Based on the provided information, SolarEdge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) is currently facing significant challenges.  Key concerns include:

*   **Severe Underperformance:** The stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Earnings & Profitability:**  Consistently negative EPS, declining profit margins, and negative ROE point to serious financial difficulties.
*   **Negative Analyst Sentiment:** Despite a "Hold" consensus, the average target price is well below the current price, and recent target price reductions indicate a lack of confidence.
*   **Concerning Financial Trends:** Declining equity raises concerns about the company's long-term financial stability.
*   **Conflicting Indicators:**  The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, while almost all other data points to significant risk. The MRI is likely flawed and should be disregarded.

**Recommendation:**

**Do NOT buy. Re-evaluate. Proceed with extreme caution.** While there might be potential for a turnaround, the current data suggests a high level of risk. Further, independent research and due diligence are strongly advised before considering any investment in SEDG. It is important to understand the specific reasons behind the negative earnings, declining equity, and analyst downgrades.
