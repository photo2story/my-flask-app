**0. Key Figures Overview:**

SEDG's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period.  The company shows high volatility and negative returns recently.  Financial statements indicate significant recent losses.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Solaredge Technologies Inc. (SEDG) is a leading provider of solar inverters and power optimizers.

* **SEDG Cumulative Return:** -68.83%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 91.19%
* **Return Difference:** -160.0% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns between SEDG and VOO at the last data point.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 1.7 (This indicates SEDG's performance is relatively low compared to VOO based on historical volatility.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and a strong positive correlation with the market (high Beta values), especially in recent years (2021-2025).  However, the alpha (outperformance relative to the market) is quite varied; sometimes positive, sometimes quite negative.  This highlights SEDG's significant risk and sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $15.93
* **Last Market Price:** $15.56
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $16.71
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $16.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.47

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop of $1.83 (Last-market data) reinforces this negative momentum.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.99 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)

* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.1 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 16964.5%  This extremely high figure requires further investigation to validate its methodology and assumptions.  A return of this magnitude is highly unrealistic without significant underlying justification. The context of this high expected return needs clarification.

The recent price drop of $1.83 (-1.83%) is significant, although it doesn't necessarily signal a "crash" on its own.  It is consistent with the overall downward trend indicated by the moving averages and technical indicators.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue      |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$21.13   | $0.26 B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -$2.31    | $0.27 B      |
| 2024-05-09 | -$2.75    | $0.20 B      |
| 2023-11-06 | -$1.08    | $0.73 B      |
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08    | $0.73 B      | *(Note: Duplicate entry - potential data error)*

The most recent earnings show a significant and unexpected loss (-$21.13 EPS).  There is a significant decline in revenue in the most recent quarter which may be linked to this extreme loss. Previous quarters also show losses, indicating a concerning trend of declining profitability.  The duplicate entry on 2024-11-07 suggests potential data errors in the source which must be rectified for a robust analysis.

| 2023-12-31 | $2.41B     | -6.73%        |

The financial statements show a dramatic decline in profitability in the last two quarters, with extremely high negative profit margins.  ROE is also significantly negative, indicating poor returns on equity.  This points to severe financial difficulties that need urgent attention.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SEDG is experiencing a significant downturn.  Negative earnings, sharply declining profitability, and low stock price relative to its moving averages indicate serious challenges. The high beta suggests significant market risk.  While the RSI is nearing oversold territory, it's not a clear buy signal given the fundamental weaknesses.  The extremely high projected return (16964.5%) requires further investigation and validation before being considered reliable.  The data suggests a highly risky investment with potential for further losses unless the underlying business conditions significantly improve.  Further investigation into the causes of the significant losses is necessary before any investment decisions can be made.  The inconsistencies in the data also need to be addressed.
