**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Linde PLC (LIN) is a global industrial gases and engineering company.  The cumulative return of LIN is 185.38%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 130.06%.  The difference is 55.3 percentage points, placing it at the 59.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, ranging from 38% to 113% over various periods.  However, the Alpha consistently remains around 0, indicating the company's returns are largely explained by market movements (high Beta values, ranging from 74 to 218, support this).

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting some recent price consolidation or minor short-term weakness after a possible prior upward trend.
