## Linde PLC (LIN) Investment Review

This report analyzes Linde PLC (LIN), a global industrial gases and engineering company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Linde PLC's cumulative return (158.45%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.91%). The difference is 37.5%, placing it at the 44.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided range of -12.3% to 99.2%).  This suggests strong relative performance but also highlights that periods of outperformance have occurred historically.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $435.30
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $440.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $449.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $463.02

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (26.98):** Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (-0.32):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -6.4%, showing a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (160.5%):**  A projected long-term (2+ years) excess return of 160.5% over the S&P 500 is presented.  This figure requires further context (e.g., the methodology used to calculate this return) for proper evaluation.  The current price of $435.30 near support levels does not necessarily indicate an impending sharp rebound or decline.  Further analysis of price action and volume is needed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue:

* **EPS:**  EPS has fluctuated between $3.21 and $3.46 over the past four quarters, showing no clear trend.
* **Revenue:** Revenue has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around $8.2 Billion. There is no significant upward or downward trend.
* **Comparison:**  No clear consistent pattern is evident in quarterly EPS or Revenue growth.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable. Profit margins have fluctuated slightly between 46.63% and 48.58%.  No clear trend is visible.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated slightly. ROE has also seen minor fluctuations around 4%, showing reasonable profitability but no significant growth trend.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions were provided.  Information on market outlook is also missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Linde PLC has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend.  While the RSI indicates an oversold condition, potentially hinting at a buying opportunity, the negative PPO suggests ongoing bearish momentum.  The relatively stable revenue and fluctuating EPS and Profit Margins do not reveal a clear, sustained growth trajectory. The provided long-term expected return needs further clarification on its calculation method before it can be confidently assessed.  More information on recent news, analyst sentiment and market outlook is needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment.  Currently, the data points to a mixed picture with both positive (historical outperformance, oversold RSI) and negative (downtrend, negative PPO) signals.
