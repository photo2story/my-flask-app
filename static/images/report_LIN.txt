The beta values are consistently above 1, suggesting higher volatility than the overall market.  However, the high alpha compensates for this higher risk, resulting in superior returns.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (50.88):**  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The market is relatively neutral.

* **Expected Return (126.9%):**  This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500, assuming consistent outperformance.
