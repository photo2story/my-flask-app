**6. Overall Analysis:**

Linde PLC has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing consistent positive alpha.  However, the recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.

The expected return of 28.5% over the long term (2+ years) is promising, but investors should monitor the market risk, earnings consistency, and resolve duplicate data entry for informed decision-making.  The high beta necessitates a careful consideration of risk tolerance.  Further investigation into the reasons for recent price declines and the duplicate earnings data point is recommended before making any investment decisions.
