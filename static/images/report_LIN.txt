Strong and stable revenue and profit margins provide a positive long-term outlook, supported by the projected long-term excess return over the S&P 500.  However, investors should carefully consider the recent price decline and the high market risk before making investment decisions. Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and EPS fluctuations is recommended.  A thorough review of the company's financial statements and future outlook is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.
