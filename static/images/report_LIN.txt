* **5-Day Moving Average:** $429.04

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $443.79

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential short-term momentum but possibly a longer-term bearish signal.  The recent price increase of $0.81 (from $432.49) represents a modest, non-dramatic increase.

* **RSI:** 62.11 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 64.5% over the long term (2+ years). This is a significant outperformance projection.

The indicators suggest a moderately positive outlook.  The significant positive expected return requires further validation and should be considered in the context of the higher risk implied by this level of projected return.
