* **Closing Price:** $457.12 (Last Market: $457.27)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $455.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $455.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $467.47

The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term pullback from a recent higher price range.

**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.51.  This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.19.  A positive value suggests upward momentum, though relatively weak based on this single data point.
* **Relative Divergence:** -15.2%. The negative value indicates a recent short-term decline in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 126.2%. This represents a significant potential excess return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the current trend continues.  This should be viewed with caution, as it's a forward-looking estimate and subject to significant market risk.
* **Market Impact:** Given the Last Market price ($457.27) is very close to the closing price and no significant jump is described, there is no evidence of any rapid price movement (either a sharp rise or fall).

Long-term potential for superior returns (as indicated by the projected 126.2% excess return)  is considerable but heavily dependent on future market conditions and company performance. Further investigation into the recent news, analyst opinions, and the details of future earnings expectations is critical before forming a definitive investment conclusion.
