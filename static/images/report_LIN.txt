**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $458.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $460.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $453.48
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $440.68

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term uptrend.  The recent price change (-0.84%) shows a small decline from the previous close.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 61.06 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.0297 (Slightly negative; suggesting potential bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.5 (Short-term upward momentum)

The RSI suggests the stock is not overbought, while the negative PPO indicates some bearish pressure.  The positive relative divergence change, however, points to short-term bullish momentum.  The recent price drop (-0.84%) is relatively small and doesn't suggest a significant immediate downward trend.

**Expected Return:** 45.9% (over S&P 500 over the long term, which is a very high estimate and needs more validation).

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
