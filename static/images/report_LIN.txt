## Linde PLC (LIN) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Linde PLC (LIN), a global industrial gases and engineering company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Linde PLC's cumulative return (178.04%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (123.86%) by 54.18%.  This places it at the 58.95th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating strong relative performance.  The historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500 was between -15.38% and 102.61%.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $449.10 (Last Market: $448.94)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $454.17
* **20-day Moving Average:** $465.01
* **60-day Moving Average:** $469.89

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the last market price indicates minimal intraday volatility on the last trading day.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (24.95):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.34):**  Shows a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-20.46):**  Confirms a recent short-term price decline.

The expected return of 23.86% represents the anticipated excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  Given the current price of $448.94, and the bearish technical indicators, a rapid price increase ("sharp rebound") is less likely at this time. A period of consolidation or further decline is more probable before a potential upward trend is confirmed.
