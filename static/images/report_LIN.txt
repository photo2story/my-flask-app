## Linde PLC (LIN) Stock Review

This report analyzes Linde PLC (LIN), a world leader in industrial gases and engineering.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Linde's cumulative return (155.53%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (116.43%).  The difference is 39.1%, placing it at the 46.1st percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a strong outperformance compared to the benchmark over the period considered.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha (ranging from 0.0 to 0.1) across all periods, suggesting the stock has generated returns above the market benchmark. Beta remains relatively stable at around 0.1 which is exceptionally low and not very useful.  The consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) indicates strong growth, though this should be considered in conjunction with the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) which shows periods of significant risk. The market cap remains consistently high at ~$206B.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $432.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $424.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $421.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $444.56

The price is currently above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance at the $444 level and a mild short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.28 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, falling within the neutral range.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.64 – A positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +5.7 – Short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 64.7% – This implies a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term, assuming the current trends continue.  The current price near the 60-day moving average however suggests caution, a potential pull-back to average could be considered.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS (Earnings Per Share) and revenue.  There is no clear trend evident from the limited data provided.  Additional data points would be beneficial to make a more concrete observation. Notably, there is a repeated entry for 2024-10-31, implying a possible data duplication error.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | 3.24 | 8.36          |

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is stable, remaining above $38 Billion. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates moderately, suggesting consistent but not overly aggressive growth.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Linde PLC demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, outperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to mildly bullish short-term outlook, while the long-term outlook remains promising based on the high expected return.  However, it is important to note that the extremely low Beta is not indicative of true market performance, and the high CAGR figures are tempered by considerable MDD values indicating significant risk.  The recent earnings data is somewhat inconsistent and requires further clarification, but current profitability metrics appear strong.  A potential pull-back in the price should be considered.  Further investigation into the fundamentals of the business and market conditions is recommended before making any investment decisions.
