**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is $460.28.  The stock experienced a slight decrease (-$0.27) from the previous close. The moving averages suggest a slightly bearish short-term trend (price below 5-day MA), but a bullish longer-term trend (price above 20-day and 60-day MAs).

* Closing Price: $460.28
* 5-day MA: $461.17
* 20-day MA: $458.24
* 60-day MA: $441.16

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (49.63):**  Near neutral territory, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (-0.15):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+7.4):** Shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.  This seemingly contradicts the negative PPO value and requires further investigation.
* **Expected Return (38.0%):**  This represents a significant projected outperformance versus the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  However, this forecast should be treated cautiously due to the inherent uncertainty in long-term predictions. The recent price change of -$0.27 does not indicate significant short-term volatility that would drastically alter this projection.

However,  investors should carefully consider the risk factors implied by the MDD values observed in the historical data and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions.  The seemingly contradictory signals from the PPO and relative divergence indicators highlight the need for a more thorough technical analysis incorporating broader market conditions and additional data points.
