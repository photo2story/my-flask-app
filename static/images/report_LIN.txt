**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Linde PLC's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference in cumulative returns is 152.46% - 112.74% = **39.72%**.

* **60-day Moving Average:** $446.38

The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price decline.  Further investigation into the reasons for this decline is necessary.
