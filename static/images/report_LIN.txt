* **5-day Moving Average:** $459.37
* **20-day Moving Average:** $459.73
* **60-day Moving Average:** $444.97

The price is slightly below its short-term moving averages, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback. However, it remains above the 60-day moving average, which is generally considered a longer-term support level. The small daily price change of $0.13 ($458.33 - $457.75) does not indicate significant immediate volatility.

* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 28.9% (above S&P 500)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. The RSI is near the neutral level, and the positive 20-day relative divergence change suggests short-term upward momentum. However, the negative PPO indicates bearish sentiment. The significant expected return suggests potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.
