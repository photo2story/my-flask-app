## Linde PLC (LIN) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Linde PLC (LIN), a world-leading industrial gases and engineering company, based on provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Linde PLC has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return for LIN is 91.18%, while VOO's is 56.06%. This represents a difference of 35.1 percentage points, placing it at the 63.3rd percentile of the historical range (max: 61.6%, min: -10.6%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across various periods, ranging from 30% to 106%.  The Beta values generally hover around 0.6-0.7, suggesting a moderate correlation with the overall market.  However, the significantly positive Alpha indicates that LIN has consistently outperformed its benchmark, driven by factors beyond market movements.  The recent periods (2022-2025) show a decline in CAGR and a negative return, but this does not negate the overall strong performance.  It is important to note that MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is fluctuating and in some periods presents significant risk.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Linde PLC (LIN) has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows a downward trend, the company maintains high profit margins and relatively stable revenue.  However, the high MDD in several periods indicates considerable risk.  The oversold conditions (RSI) suggest a potential bounce, but further analysis considering the high Market Risk Indicator is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The projected long-term return remains promising, but caution is advised due to the recent decline and high risk indicators.  Additional data and deeper fundamental analysis are recommended before making any investment decisions.
