**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show relatively stable performance with slight fluctuations.  While a detailed analysis requires more context (e.g., comparison to analyst estimates, industry benchmarks), the numbers don't indicate any significant downturn.  The lack of projected earnings alongside the most recent reported numbers prevents a comprehensive review.  More data would be necessary to conduct a thorough analysis.
