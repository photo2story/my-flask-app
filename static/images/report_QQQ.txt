## Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) Investment Report

This report analyzes Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, providing exposure to 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

**1. Performance Analysis & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

QQQ's cumulative return is 195.96%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 127.58%.  The difference is 68.38%, placing it at the 83.31 percentile of its historical performance relative to the VOO (based on the provided maximum and minimum historical differences).  The provided Alpha values consistently show outperformance relative to the benchmark, though Beta is consistently near 0 suggesting low correlation with the market. This high relative performance is largely consistent across the provided years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $505.79 (Last Market: $507.86)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $503.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $501.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $488.05

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates recent price stability.


**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 67.82 –  Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating potential for a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.15 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum, but it's relatively close to zero.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -0.86 – Indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 6.73% (Long-term, 2+ years, relative to S&P 500) –  This suggests potential for outperformance over the long run compared to the S&P 500. The last market price of 507.86 is only slightly above the closing price, not indicative of a sharp price movement.


**4. Recent Earnings & Outlook:**

No earnings data is available in the provided information.  A thorough analysis of QQQ's performance requires access to its underlying holdings' individual financial statements.  Without this data, a comprehensive evaluation of current performance and future earnings is impossible.


**5. Financial Information:**

No detailed financial trends are available for QQQ.  Again, this necessitates accessing the financial data of the underlying Nasdaq-100 companies.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news is provided.  Information from sources like FINBOLD or similar financial news outlets is required to provide a complete view of recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.


**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, as evidenced by the significantly higher cumulative return. However, current technical indicators suggest potential for short-term price correction. The lack of earnings data and detailed financial information hinders a thorough evaluation of the fund's current financial health and future prospects.  Further investigation into news, analyst opinions and the financial performance of the underlying holdings is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high relative performance in the past may not be indicative of future returns.  More information is needed to assess the long-term outlook.  The overbought RSI is also a signal for caution.
