**Analysis of Alpha, Beta Table:**

*   **Alpha:** Negative alpha values across most recent periods (2019-2025) indicate QQQ has underperformed its benchmark (likely the Nasdaq-100 or S&P 500, depending on the alpha calculation method) on a risk-adjusted basis.  The magnitude of the negative alpha is significant in some periods (e.g., -19% for 2020-2022).
*   **Beta:** Beta values have fluctuated, and have been close to or below 0.  This suggests that QQQ's volatility has been less than that of the benchmark. A beta of -0.1 (2023-2025) suggests an inverse correlation, although a value this close to zero requires careful interpretation.
*   **CAGR & MDD:** The recent periods (2020-2025) show high Maximum Drawdown (MDD), indicating substantial potential losses during those periods. CAGR fluctuates greatly.
*   **Cap(B):** The Capital (in Billions) has generally been increasing, showing the fund's growth in assets under management despite performance fluctuations.

The price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a slight short-term downward trend.  The price is above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend is still in place.  The negative change from the previous close (-1.16) confirms the recent downward pressure.

QQQ is currently underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) and recent price action suggests a short-term downward trend. While the MRI indicates low market risk, the hybrid signal's recommendation for a high cash position suggests caution.  The negative alpha values from 2019-2025 are concerning, indicating underperformance relative to a benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.  The recent news flow points to ongoing volatility and the need for investors to remain vigilant.

Despite recent underperformance, the long-term expected return of 80.2% is attractive. However, given the recent trends and news, a cautious approach is warranted.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Monitor News Closely:** Pay attention to the specific news events driving volatility.
*   **Consider Diversification:** Ensure a well-diversified portfolio to mitigate the risks associated with QQQ's underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Re-evaluate Investment Strategy:** If the underperformance trend continues, consider re-evaluating the investment strategy and potentially reducing exposure to QQQ.
*   **Risk Management:** Implement appropriate risk management strategies, such as stop-loss orders, to protect capital.
