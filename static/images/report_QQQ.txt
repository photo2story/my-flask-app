## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Investment Review

This report analyzes the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, providing exposure to large-cap technology companies.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

QQQ's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  Specifically, QQQ shows a cumulative return of 90.63%, while VOO shows 71.02%. This results in a 19.6 percentage point difference.  Considering the historical range of the difference (max 60.7%, min -6.7%), this current difference represents a 39% percentile ranking relative to past performance, suggesting QQQ's outperformance is notable but not exceptionally extreme in a historical context.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results regarding QQQ's performance relative to the market (presumably represented by the S&P 500). While QQQ often exhibits a positive alpha (outperformance), indicating manager skill or sector-specific advantages,  the beta generally hovers around 1, implying similar volatility to the market. The significant variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) across different periods suggests substantial market-related fluctuations.  The consistently high MDD indicates considerable risk associated with QQQ's investment strategy.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 35.0% | 54.6% | 5.0% | 0.2 | 104.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 26.0% | 62.7% | 9.0% | -0.2 | 104.3 |
| 2017-2019  | 43.0% | 62.7% | 14.0% | 0.6 | 144.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 70.0% | 62.7% | 41.0% | 0.5 | 215.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 120.0% | 13.4% | 46.0% | 0.5 | 274.1 |
| 2020-2022  | 7.0% | 65.1% | -14.0% | 0.5 | 184.8 |
| 2021-2023  | 10.0% | 70.3% | -18.0% | 1.1 | 286.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 7.0% | 70.6% | -8.0% | 1.1 | 359.3 |
| 2023-2025  | 11.0% | 70.6% | 8.0% | 1.1 | 297.5 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

QQQ's recent price action shows a significant decline. The closing price is $422.67, considerably lower than the previous close ($450.66) representing a drop of $6.21.  This is reflected in the moving averages:  the 5-day moving average ($458.22), 20-day moving average ($473.53), and 60-day moving average ($503.33) are all significantly above the current price. This suggests a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The technical indicators reveal a bearish sentiment:

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 indicates a high-risk environment.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 24.48, significantly below 30, suggests the asset is oversold.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.74,  below zero,  points to bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A -6.1 change in the 20-day relative divergence indicates a recent short-term decline.

The large negative price change (`{'price': 422.67, 'previousClose': 450.66, 'change': -6.21}`)  suggests a sharp recent decline.   While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, indicating potential for a bounce, the overall picture remains bearish.

The expected return of 34.8% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 represents a significant potential outperformance. However, this projection should be treated with caution, given the inherent volatility of QQQ and the uncertainty of future market conditions.  The current bearish technical indicators suggest that realizing this return could take considerably longer than anticipated, and significant downside risk exists in the near term.
