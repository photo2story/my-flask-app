## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Report

**Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** QQQ
* **Company:** Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the Nasdaq-100 index.
* **Cumulative Return (QQQ):** 84.84%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 66.36%
* **Return Difference (QQQ - VOO):** 18.5%
* **Relative Divergence:** 37.6% (Indicates QQQ's performance is in the upper 37.6th percentile relative to VOO's performance over the historical range).


**Performance Analysis:**

QQQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return 18.5 percentage points higher.  The relative divergence suggests that this outperformance is relatively high compared to historical fluctuations between the two assets. However, the high relative divergence should be interpreted cautiously.  A high relative divergence does not guarantee future outperformance and can indicate a potential reversion to the mean.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows substantial variation year over year. While some years exhibit exceptionally high growth (e.g., 2019-2021), others show negative or low returns (e.g., 2020-2023).  The Alpha values generally indicate positive outperformance relative to the market (Beta = 1), particularly in recent years.  However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results. The relatively high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) in several periods highlights the inherent risk associated with this investment.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the growth of the fund.

**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $454.40
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $441.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $465.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $497.67

The current closing price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The 5-day moving average is significantly lower, indicating recent price volatility.  The recent price increase of $1.84 (from the previous close) might be a short-term bounce and warrants further monitoring.

**Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk category).  Suggests caution.
* **RSI:** 39.62 (Approaching oversold territory, potentially signaling a short-term bounce but not a clear buy signal).
* **PPO:** -0.13 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum).
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +8.0 (Indicates recent short-term upward momentum).

The combination of a high MRI, relatively low RSI, negative PPO, and a recent short-term upward momentum presents a mixed signal.  While the recent price increase suggests a potential short-term bounce, the overall indicators point towards a cautious outlook.

**Expected Return & Conclusion:**

The projected 31.5% expected return over the long term (2+ years) significantly exceeds the implied return of VOO. This suggests potential for outperformance, but it's essential to remember this is a prediction and not a guaranteed outcome.  The significant risk (high MRI and MDD values), coupled with current price action below key moving averages, necessitates a thorough risk assessment before investing.  A diversified portfolio approach is recommended to mitigate risk.  Further analysis of market conditions and fundamental factors is advised before making any investment decisions.
