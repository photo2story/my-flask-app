**1. Performance Overview and Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, providing exposure to 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

The cumulative return for QQQ is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **QQQ Cumulative Return:** 165.56%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 108.62%
* **Return Difference:** 56.94%  This indicates QQQ outperformed VOO considerably over the analyzed period.  The relative divergence of 78.7% places the QQQ's performance in the top 78.7% of its historical performance relative to the VOO.  While a high relative divergence suggests strong outperformance, it is important to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future returns.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying Alpha and Beta values across different periods.  Alpha consistently remains positive, though it fluctuates, suggesting that QQQ has generally outperformed the market (represented by the benchmark against which Beta is calculated) over the given time periods, except for 2020-2022. Beta, representing the volatility relative to the market, is generally around 1.00, indicating similar volatility to the benchmark.  However, the large market cap (Cap(B)) suggests QQQ is a significant market player with good liquidity.  Note:  The specific benchmark for Beta is not specified in the provided data.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $491.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $494.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $517.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $520.08

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term. The recent price increase of $0.735 (from the previous close) is relatively small compared to the moving averages.  It's not a significant "sharp upward" movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 23.50 – This indicates the asset is in oversold territory, suggesting a potential rebound.
* **PPO:** -0.76 – This negative value suggests a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.5% – This indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 16.2% – This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.

**Conclusion:**

While QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly,  current indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages, and recent relative divergence) paint a somewhat bearish short-term picture.  However, the long-term expected return remains positive and suggests that a long-term investment strategy could still yield significant gains.  Further investigation into the specific market conditions and risk tolerance is necessary before making investment decisions.
