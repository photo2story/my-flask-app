**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053, indicating a medium risk level.
* **RSI:** 54.71, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.64, a positive value indicating bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:**  A positive change of 4.4 over the last 20 days points to short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** A projected 29.2% outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment.


**Conclusion:**

While QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, recent performance has been weaker. Current indicators suggest a medium-risk environment with moderate bullish momentum. The long-term outlook remains positive, with a considerable projected outperformance against the S&P 500, provided consistent investment.  However,  investors should be aware of the potential for increased volatility given the Beta values shown in recent years. Further analysis, including consideration of macro-economic factors and industry trends affecting the Nasdaq-100 components, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
