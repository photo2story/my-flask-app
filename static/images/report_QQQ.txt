## Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) Investment Report

This report analyzes Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index,  a market-capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.


**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

QQQ's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The final day's cumulative return difference is 68.2 percentage points (QQQ: 198.26%, VOO: 130.06%). The relative divergence of 83.1% indicates QQQ's performance has been substantially above the S&P 500 for a significant portion of the historical period considered.  However,  this relative divergence is a percentile rank, not a predictive measure. The provided CAGR data (compound annual growth rate) also demonstrates QQQ's superior historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (though note the considerable year-to-year variance).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $509.74
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $507.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $504.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $490.94

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 44.41  - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning towards the oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.073 -  Indicates a bearish momentum, although the magnitude is relatively small.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-) - Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance compared to the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 68.0% - This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon assuming consistent historical outperformance. This is a significant projection and depends heavily on maintaining the historical trend. The current price near 509.71 does not suggest any immediate, drastic price changes (neither a sharp rebound nor a steep decline).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, evidenced by its significantly higher cumulative return and CAGR. However, recent performance relative to the benchmark is slightly down. Technical indicators suggest a relatively neutral to slightly bearish short-term sentiment. The provided expected return of 68% over the long term is a substantial projection, and heavily dependent on future market conditions and maintaining historical outperformance.
