## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Performance Review

This report analyzes the performance of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, a market-capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

QQQ's cumulative return of 85.12% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 76.18%.  The difference is 8.9%, placing it at the 26.4th percentile of its historical range (max: 57.7%, min: -8.6%).  While this shows relative outperformance, it's important to consider the context of the entire historical range.

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows mixed results. While Alpha is positive in several periods (indicating outperformance relative to the market),  it's negative in some periods. Beta generally remains around 1, which implies similar volatility to the market.  However, the high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures in certain periods reflect the fund’s growth potential.  It’s crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The significant market capitalization (Cap(B)) highlights QQQ's scale and liquidity.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2017-2019  | 45.0% | 62.7% | 12.0% | 0.8 | 137.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 62.0% | 62.7% | 32.0% | 0.7 | 204.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 104.0% | 60.9% | 44.0% | 0.7 | 260.8 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is 444.10.  The recent price action shows a slight downward trend:

* **Closing Price:** 444.10
* **5-day MA:** 451.63
* **20-day MA:** 460.02
* **60-day MA:** 492.93

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The small daily change (-0.02) suggests minimal immediate volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk) suggests a moderate level of risk.
* **RSI:** 42.47 (below 50) suggests the asset is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** 0.1937 (positive) indicates a bullish momentum, although it’s relatively weak.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -3.6% (negative) confirms the short-term bearish trend.

The provided `{'price': 444.1, 'previousClose': 444.18, 'change': -0.02}` shows a minor price decrease, not significant enough to classify as a sharp drop.

The expected return of 37.1% over the long term (2+ years) represents a substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500. This projection should be viewed cautiously, as it's based on historical data and future market conditions are inherently unpredictable.


**Conclusion:**

QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, though recent performance is less impressive. Current indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend, but long-term prospects remain potentially positive based on the projected outperformance.  Investors should consider the moderate risk level and the inherent volatility of the market before making any investment decisions.  Further in-depth analysis, including examining the components of the Nasdaq-100, is recommended for a more comprehensive evaluation.
