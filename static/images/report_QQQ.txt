2025-11-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of QQQ based on the provided data:

**1. Basic Performance Comparison: QQQ vs. VOO**

*   **Ticker:** QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1) - *A popular ETF that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, primarily composed of technology companies.*
*   **QQQ Cumulative Return:** 87.99%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 94.64%
*   **Divergence (QQQ - VOO):** -6.6%
*   **Relative Divergence:** 3.1 (This indicates QQQ's current divergence from VOO is near its historical low).

**Analysis:**

*   QQQ has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period.  The -6.6% divergence means that, for every $100 invested at the start, QQQ would have returned $6.60 less than VOO.
*   The relative divergence of 3.1 suggests that QQQ's current underperformance compared to VOO is near the lower end of its historical range, implying it *could* potentially catch up if historical patterns repeat (though this is not guaranteed).

**2. Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Analysis**

Here's a breakdown and analysis of the table:

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 34.0%  | 63.5% | 6.0%  | 0.1  | 101.8  |
| 2016-2018  | 21.0%  | 71.9% | 6.0%  | 0.1  | 100.8  |
| 2017-2019  | 38.0%  | 71.9% | 16.0% | 0.5  | 139.0  |
| 2018-2020  | 42.0%  | 78.1% | 19.0% | 0.5  | 205.1  |
| 2019-2021  | 79.0%  | 78.1% | 32.0% | 0.7  | 260.1  |
| 2020-2022  | -21.0% | 81.3% | -20.0% | 0.8  | 174.1  |
| 2021-2023  | -21.0% | 81.3% | -23.0% | 1.0  | 267.7  |
| 2022-2024  | -9.0%  | 81.3% | -30.0% | 1.1  | 334.2  |
| 2023-2025  | 47.0%  | 79.8% | -12.0% | 1.1  | 385.8  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Indicates the average annual growth rate over the period.  Notice the strong growth from 2017-2021, followed by negative CAGR in recent periods, then a rebound more recently.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  MDD is high and has been consistently high, indicating substantial risk.  This is typical of a technology-heavy index.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the investment's performance relative to the benchmark (presumably S&P 500) after accounting for risk (Beta).  The Alpha has been negative in recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark, even considering its higher Beta.
*   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the market.  Beta values consistently above 1 (especially in recent periods) mean QQQ is more volatile than the S&P 500. A Beta of 1.1 means that if the S&P 500 moves 1%, QQQ tends to move 1.1% in the same direction.
*   **Cap(B):** Not clarified, so analysis cannot be done.

**Analysis:**

*   **High Risk, High Potential Reward:** QQQ historically offers higher potential returns (as seen in the 2017-2021 period) but comes with significantly higher risk (indicated by the high MDD and Beta).
*   **Recent Underperformance:**  The negative Alpha values and recent negative CAGR indicate that QQQ has been underperforming its benchmark even when accounting for its risk.  This could be due to various factors affecting the technology sector.
*   **Increasing Volatility:** The increasing Beta suggests that QQQ's volatility relative to the market has been increasing.

**3. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 590.07
*   **Previous Close:** 585.67
*   **Change:** 0.75 (Increase)
*   **5-day SMA:** 595.12
*   **20-day SMA:** 615.80
*   **60-day SMA:** 602.24

**Analysis:**

*   **Short-Term Downtrend:**  The price is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a short-term downtrend.
*   **Recent Bounce:** The positive change compared to the previous close and the fact that the 5-day SMA is slightly higher than the current price suggests a recent small rebound, but it hasn't yet overcome the broader short-term downward trend.

**4. RSI, PPO, and Market Risk Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 25.53 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.73 (Negative, below zero)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.7 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 178.5% (Long-term outlook)

**Analysis:**

*   **Oversold Conditions:** The RSI of 25.53 suggests that QQQ is currently oversold, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity.  However, oversold conditions can persist for extended periods.
*   **Momentum:** The negative PPO confirms that momentum is negative.
*   **Market Risk Indicator:** The MRI suggests a Medium investment recommendation, but the data includes (0.9~1.0: High Investment Recommended, 0.7~0.9: Medium Investment, 0.4~0.7: Low Investment, <0.4: Very Risky), it is not possible to follow the meaning.
*   **Hybrid Signal: Buy signal**
*   **Short-Term Weakness:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms short-term downward pressure.
*   **High Expected Long-Term Return:**  The very high expected return (178.5%) should be taken with a grain of salt. This figure could be based on specific models and assumptions that may not hold true.  It suggests that, according to the model, QQQ is undervalued and has significant long-term growth potential.

**5. Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines provide a mixed picture:

*   **QQQ vs. VOO Comparison:** Several articles directly compare QQQ and VOO, highlighting the tech-heavy growth potential of QQQ versus the broader diversification of VOO.
*   **Market Downturn/Bubble Warning:** The news about the unemployment rate increase and Ray Dalio's bubble warning suggests a broader market concern that could negatively impact QQQ. The 'Wipe out gains' comment indicates recent negative movement.
*   **Institutional Investment:**  The report of Stevens Capital Management's stake is a minor positive signal, showing some institutional confidence.
*   **AI-Driven Rally & Dot-Com Era Red Flag:** These headlines present a contradictory view.  One suggests significant upside potential driven by AI, while the other warns of a potential bubble similar to the dot-com era, highlighting the risks associated with tech-heavy investments.
*   **Fed Minutes & Nvidia:** The article about Nasdaq 100 (which QQQ tracks) rising ahead of Fed minutes and Nvidia tests indicates some potential positive catalysts, particularly related to the technology sector.

**6. Comprehensive Analysis & Summary**

*   **Mixed Signals:** The analysis paints a mixed picture for QQQ.
*   **Short-Term Concerns:** The recent underperformance, negative momentum indicators, and news of market downturns suggest caution in the short term.
*   **Potential for Rebound:** The oversold RSI, low relative divergence, and high expected long-term return (though potentially optimistic) suggest the possibility of a rebound.  The positive news related to Nvidia and potential AI-driven growth provides some potential catalysts.
*   **Higher Risk, Higher Reward:** QQQ remains a higher-risk investment due to its concentration in the technology sector and its higher Beta.  The high MDD values highlight the potential for significant drawdowns.
*   **VOO as an Alternative:** The comparison with VOO highlights the importance of diversification. Investors may consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to VOO or other broader market ETFs to mitigate the risks associated with QQQ's sector concentration.

**Recommendation (Based on the Data):**

Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. Consider the following:

*   **For Existing Holders:**  Hold with caution, closely monitoring market conditions and sector-specific news.  Consider rebalancing the portfolio to reduce exposure to QQQ if it represents an overly large portion.
*   **For Potential Investors:**  Averaging into QQQ slowly may be a buying opportunity. However, be aware of the high volatility and potential for further downside.
