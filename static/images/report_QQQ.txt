QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, indicated by consistently positive alpha values and a significant divergence in cumulative returns.  However, the recent RSI suggests a potential short-term pullback. While the long-term expected return is positive, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

Consider diversifying your portfolio and consulting a financial advisor before investing.
