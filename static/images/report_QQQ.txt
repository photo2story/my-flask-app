**Company Overview:**

Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, providing exposure to large and mid-cap growth companies listed on the Nasdaq.


**Performance Analysis:**

QQQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed, showing a cumulative return of 185.51% compared to VOO's 118.31%. This represents a difference of 67.2%, placing it at the 92.2nd percentile of its historical relative performance compared to VOO.  This substantial outperformance suggests a higher growth potential but also potentially higher risk.

The provided CAGR data shows consistently strong returns for QQQ across various periods, except for the 2020-2022 period which shows a negative return.  However, the high Alpha values (particularly in later years) indicate consistent outperformance relative to the market benchmark. Beta values generally hover around 1, reflecting QQQ's sensitivity to market movements. Note that the increasing market capitalization over time signifies growing market dominance of QQQ's constituent companies. The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) shows periods of significant losses, highlighting the inherent risk associated with investing in a growth-oriented index fund.

**Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of QQQ ($526.08) is below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it sits above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term trend that might be less bearish. The recent price change (-$2.08) reflects a minor decline, but its significance should be assessed in context of broader market trends.  This decline aligns with the negative 20-day relative divergence change.

**Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 53.45 is close to the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The PPO of 0.05 indicates a slightly positive momentum. However, taken together with the recent price decline and relative divergence, a cautious approach is warranted.  The short-term bearish trend (as suggested by the relative divergence) should be monitored closely.

**Expected Return:**

An 11.2% expected return over two years relative to the S&P 500 suggests a significant outperformance expectation for long-term investors.  This aligns with the historical data showing strong alpha. However, remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and this projection carries inherent risk.  The risk associated with this investment should be carefully considered in light of the historical MDDs observed.
