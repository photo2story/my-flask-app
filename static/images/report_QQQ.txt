| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

QQQ's closing price is $518.11, slightly down from the previous close ($522.29). The recent price action shows a short-term downward trend:

* **5-day moving average:** $521.22
* **20-day moving average:** $519.09
* **60-day moving average:** $516.19

The price is currently trading below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish sentiment. However, it is still above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The recent drop is relatively minor and might be considered a consolidation phase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (59.04):**  Indicates the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral momentum.
* **PPO (-0.04):**  Slightly negative, implying a weakening short-term momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (2.9, +):** Suggests a short-term upward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (12.5%):**  A 12.5% expected return above the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon is a positive projection,  but it is crucial to remember that this is just an estimate and future returns are not guaranteed.  The recent minor price drop (-0.8%) is not significant enough to warrant concerns about a sharp reversal.


**Conclusion:**

Despite a minor recent price correction, QQQ's long-term performance has been significantly stronger than the S&P 500.  The technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook, but the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by the strong historical performance and the projected higher long-term returns compared to the S&P 500.  However, investors should be aware of the increased market sensitivity (higher Beta) and potential volatility. Further analysis, including qualitative factors and macro-economic considerations, is recommended before making any investment decision.
