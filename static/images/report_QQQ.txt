* **Company:** Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index.
* **Cumulative Return (QQQ):** 117.11%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 85.44%
* **Return Difference (QQQ vs VOO):** 31.7%

**Performance Analysis:**

The provided data shows that QQQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return exceeding that of the S&P 500 by 31.7 percentage points.  The relative divergence suggests this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals varying performance characteristics across different time periods. While Alpha is generally positive, indicating outperformance relative to the market benchmark, it is not consistently high. Beta, measuring market sensitivity,  fluctuates but is generally above 1, suggesting higher volatility than the S&P 500.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) varies significantly, highlighting periods of significant risk.  The substantial increase in Beta and Alpha in the more recent years (2021-2025) is noteworthy and warrants further investigation into the underlying factors driving this change.


**Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $450.66
* **Previous Close:** $476.15
* **Daily Change:** -$5.35 (Significant daily drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $467.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $476.95
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $504.86

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The significant daily drop of $5.35 warrants further investigation into any market-moving news or events that may have triggered this decline. This could be a temporary correction or the start of a larger downward trend.


**Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.54 (Suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a bounce, but not a definite buy signal.)
* **PPO:** -0.19 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 19.3% (This represents a projected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment, assuming the current trends continue.  This is a forecast and not a guarantee.)


**Conclusion:**

While QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, its recent price action and technical indicators suggest a cautious approach. The significant daily drop needs further investigation.  The high relative divergence suggests that QQQâ€™s recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 may not be sustainable. However, the long-term expected return remains positive, suggesting potential for long-term investors despite current volatility. A thorough review of current market conditions and news affecting the Nasdaq-100 is crucial before making any investment decisions.
