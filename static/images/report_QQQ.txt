**Performance Analysis:**

The provided data shows QQQ significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The 70.2% difference in cumulative returns highlights this outperformance. The high relative divergence (96.1%) further emphasizes that this level of outperformance is exceptionally high compared to historical fluctuations between the two assets.  However, this past performance is not indicative of future results.

The Alpha and Beta analysis provides further insights into the risk-adjusted returns.  The Alpha consistently positive values (except for 2020-2022) indicate QQQ generated excess returns compared to the benchmark, while the Beta values show varying levels of market sensitivity.  Noticeably, Beta increases from 0.3 to 1.0 in the 2021-2025 periods suggesting increased market correlation in recent years.  The consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values, particularly in recent years,  contribute to the substantial cumulative return.  The relatively low Maximum Drawdown (MDD)  suggests QQQ has experienced relatively smaller maximum peak-to-trough declines compared to its substantial gains. However, it should be carefully noted that this analysis is limited to the period provided.

* **Closing Price:** $538.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $531.92

The price is currently trading above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.


**Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 73.17  (Approaching overbought territory; values above 70 often suggest a potential price correction.)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.23 (Positive value suggests upward momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +6.4% (Indicates a recent increase in relative strength of QQQ compared to VOO.)
* **Expected Return:** 10.1% (This is a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500, assuming a similar performance pattern continues. This should be viewed with significant caution as past performance is not indicative of future results.)

**Overall Assessment:**

QQQ has demonstrated strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500. However, the high RSI suggests a potential short-term correction might occur.  The positive PPO and recent relative divergence confirm positive momentum.  The long-term expected return is substantial but highly uncertain given the inherent risks in the market. Investors should consider the high relative divergence, suggesting an elevated level of risk of a potential reversion to the mean in the future.  Therefore, a comprehensive risk assessment and diversification strategy are crucial before making any investment decisions.  This analysis solely relies on the limited data provided and should not be considered financial advice.
