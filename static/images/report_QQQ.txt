## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Performance Review

This report analyzes the performance of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, a market-capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

QQQ's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO) at 192.05% versus 121.84%.  This represents a difference of 70.2 percentage points, placing it at the 96.1th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the VOO (ranging from a minimum of -3.3% to a maximum of 73.2%).

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures for QQQ, especially between 2017 and 2021.  However, it's important to note the significant alpha variation across years,  and substantial maximum drawdown (MDD) experienced in some periods (e.g., 2020-2022).  The beta values generally hover around 1, indicating a similar volatility to the market, with the exception of some periods showing notably lower or higher beta values.  This suggests that while QQQ generally tracks market movements, it exhibits periods of outperformance and underperformance. The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the growth of the underlying companies.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 73.17  -  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70).
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.23 -  Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** +6.4 - Shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative outperformance compared to the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 10.1% - This suggests that a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy could yield a 10.1% higher return than the S&P 500.


**Conclusion:**

QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong growth potential. However, its high RSI suggests potential short-term overbought conditions and the historical data shows periods of significant drawdowns.  The positive PPO and the positive relative divergence suggest near-term strength.  The high expected long-term return is promising, but investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with investing in the technology sector, particularly the volatility of the Nasdaq-100. A diversified investment strategy is always recommended.
