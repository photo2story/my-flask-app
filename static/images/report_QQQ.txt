**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

QQQ has underperformed the S&P 500 recently.  While historical performance (CAGR, Alpha) has been strong in certain periods, the high MDD and Beta indicate significant risk and volatility.

**In summary, QQQ is facing some short-term headwinds, and its historical volatility needs to be carefully considered. The long-term outlook is uncertain. Potential investors should carefully evaluate their risk tolerance and investment goals before investing in QQQ.**
