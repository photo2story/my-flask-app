### 5. 종합적인 분석

QQQ presents a mixed picture. It has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, and its technical indicators suggest potential short-term bearish momentum, with RSI approaching oversold. However, the long-term expected return is attractive. Recent news highlights both opportunities (AI, ETF flows) and risks (rate-cut impacts, AI bubble concerns) within the fund.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the current indicators, QQQ may represent a long-term buying opportunity, especially if the RSI continues into oversold territory. However, investors should be aware of the potential for continued volatility and the risks associated with its technology-heavy holdings. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk.  Monitor news related to interest rates and AI sector developments closely.
