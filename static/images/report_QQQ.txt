## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index,  shows significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **QQQ Overview:** Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, providing exposure to large-cap growth companies.

* **Cumulative Returns:**
    * QQQ: 192.05%
    * VOO: 121.84%
    * **Difference:** 70.2% (This represents the difference in cumulative return between QQQ and VOO as of the last day of the data.)

* **Divergence Analysis:** The relative divergence of 96.1% indicates that QQQ's performance has been significantly higher than VOO's throughout most of the historical period considered.  This high value suggests QQQ has outperformed VOO by a margin substantially exceeding its average historical outperformance.


* **Alpha & Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows varying Alpha and Beta values across different periods. High Alpha values (e.g., 16.0% in 2017-2019, 53.0% in 2019-2021) suggest periods of significant outperformance relative to the market (Beta reflects market sensitivity; values around 1 indicate similar market sensitivity).  Negative Alpha (-11.0% in 2020-2022) shows underperformance compared to the market. The increasing Beta from 0.4 to 1.0 over the years suggests increasing market correlation. Market capitalization has generally grown over the years, indicating QQQ's increasing influence within its index.



**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $538.15
* **5-day Moving Average:** $531.92
* **20-day Moving Average:** $526.20
* **60-day Moving Average:** $519.54

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average implies minimal short-term volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (73.17):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70), suggesting potential short-term price correction.

* **PPO (0.23):** A positive value indicates bullish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (6.4% +):**  Confirms a recent short-term upward trend in the relative performance of QQQ against VOO.


* **Change from Previous Close (0.42%):**  This represents a modest daily increase, not significant enough to signal a dramatic price swing (neither a sharp uptrend nor a sharp downtrend).

* **Expected Return (10.1%):**  This represents the predicted long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500 if a buy-and-hold strategy is employed from the current point.  This is a prediction only and there is no guarantee of this performance.


**Conclusion:**

QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, particularly in certain periods. While the current price is above its moving averages and shows some bullish momentum,  the RSI is approaching overbought levels, suggesting the possibility of a near-term pullback.  The high relative divergence against VOO, coupled with a positive expected return, suggests continued long-term outperformance is possible, but it's crucial to monitor the market conditions and consider other factors before making investment decisions.  Note that past performance is not indicative of future results.
