**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

QQQ is currently showing mixed signals. While recent price action suggests short-term bullish momentum, the overbought RSI and negative divergence compared to VOO warrant caution. The high expected return is attractive, but the significant MDD and Beta near 1 suggest substantial risk. The news flow presents both tailwinds (tech/AI strength) and headwinds (macroeconomic uncertainty). The Hybrid Signal recommends buy 80% of cash.
