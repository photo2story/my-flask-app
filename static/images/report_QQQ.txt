**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows significant volatility, ranging from -21% to 79%, reflecting the growth-oriented nature of the Nasdaq-100.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values (63.5% to 81.3%) indicate the potential for significant losses, typical of growth stocks.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is generally positive in earlier periods (2015-2021), indicating outperformance relative to its benchmark. However, more recently, the Alpha has turned negative, suggesting underperformance.  This is critical as it reflects QQQ not just keeping pace with the market risk (Beta) but underperforming it.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally less than 1, but trending upward, suggesting QQQ has become slightly more sensitive to market movements over time.
*   **Cap(B):** The Capitalization, measured in Billions, has steadily increased, reflecting the overall growth of the companies within the QQQ ETF.

*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and the 60-day SMA is also below the 20-day SMA.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

QQQ is a technology-focused ETF that has recently underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). While recent price action is positive (above moving averages), historical data shows high volatility and periods of significant underperformance (negative Alpha). The short-term divergence change suggests some recent outperformance, but the PPO indicates caution. The MRI suggests a medium level of risk. The extremely high expected return should be carefully scrutinized.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Growth vs. Stability:** QQQ offers higher growth potential but is inherently more volatile than a broad market index like the S&P 500.
*   **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Technology stocks are often sensitive to interest rate changes.
*   **Economic Data:** QQQ's performance is influenced by macroeconomic factors, including jobs data and inflation.
*   **AI Sector:** The "AI Blues" mentioned in the news highlights potential risks and uncertainties within the AI sector, which could impact QQQ.
*   **Modernization:** The shareholder vote to approve modernization may result in changes to the ETF. It's important to understand the details of these changes before making any decisions.
*   **Invesco Review:** The monthly review may contain more information on QQQ performance, especially around changes to the index.

**Investment Recommendation (Based on the limited data provided):**

*   **Cautious Optimism:** Given the recent positive price action, the potential for a reversal of the underperformance relative to VOO (based on the relative divergence), and the high expected return, a small allocation to QQQ *might* be considered.
*   **Risk Management:** However, due to the inherent volatility and the negative Alpha in recent years, this allocation should be carefully managed and represent only a small portion of a diversified portfolio.
*   **Further Research:** Before investing, it's crucial to:
    *   Research the specifics of the "modernization" approved by shareholders.
    *   Analyze the holdings and sector allocation of QQQ to ensure they align with your investment goals.
    *   Consider a long-term investment horizon to weather potential market fluctuations.
