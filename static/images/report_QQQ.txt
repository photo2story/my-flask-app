**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | 12.0%   | 19.1%   | 8.0%    | 1.2  | 101.2  |
| 2017-2019  | 30.0%   | 19.1%   | 13.0%   | 1.2  | 139.5  |
| 2018-2020  | 36.0%   | 19.1%   | 16.0%   | 1.1  | 205.9  |
| 2019-2021  | 72.0%   | 12.7%   | 28.0%   | 1.0  | 261.1  |
| 2020-2022  | -22.0%  | 34.0%   | -20.0%   | 1.1  | 174.7  |
| 2021-2023  | -21.0%  | 34.0%   | -22.0%   | 1.3  | 268.7  |
| 2022-2024  | -9.0%   | 26.8%   | -28.0%   | 1.3  | 335.5  |
| 2023-2025  | 51.0%   | 19.2%   | -11.0%   | 1.3  | 403.1  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The annual rate of return assuming profits are reinvested.  Shows strong growth in some periods (e.g., 2019-2021) and significant declines in others (2020-2022, 2021-2023).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. Indicates potential risk.  MDD has been quite high recently.
*   **Alpha:**  A measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Positive alpha indicates outperformance relative to the benchmark, while negative alpha indicates underperformance.  Recently, QQQ has shown significantly negative alpha.
*   **Beta:**  A measure of volatility compared to the market (S&P 500).  A beta of 1.0 means QQQ's price tends to move in the same direction and magnitude as the S&P 500.  A beta greater than 1.0 (as is the case in recent years) indicates that QQQ is *more* volatile than the S&P 500. Beta gradually went up, indicating that QQQ is more sensitive to market fluctuations than before.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in billions. QQQ's market cap has generally increased over time.

*   **Analysis:**  The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a mixed picture. While QQQ has demonstrated strong growth in some periods, its recent negative alpha figures indicate underperformance relative to its benchmark, even considering its higher volatility (beta). The high MDD figures also highlight the potential downside risk associated with QQQ, especially during turbulent market conditions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 620.47
*   **Last Market:** Price: 626.65, Previous Close: 620.47, Change: 1.0 (Likely means up 1.0%)
*   **5-day SMA:** 619.80
*   **20-day SMA:** 617.92
*   **60-day SMA:** 615.56

    *   **Analysis:** The current price is above all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).  This *could* be a short-term bullish signal. However, the price also had a slight increase from the previous day so there may be price volatility in the stock.  Need to watch if the price can hold above these SMAs.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 70.56 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.0319
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-07)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.3 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 75.8

    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **MRI:** A value of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk, indicating a moderately favorable market environment.
        *   **RSI:**  An RSI above 70 suggests that QQQ is approaching "overbought" conditions, meaning it *may* be due for a pullback or correction. However, RSI can stay in overbought territory for extended periods during strong uptrends.
        *   **PPO:** The PPO is above 0, suggesting the shorter moving average is above the longer moving average, which typically indicates an upward trend.
        *   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal suggests buying 80% of available cash, indicating a moderately bullish stance, but with caution advised due to the MRI of 0.7.
        *   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days confirms the short-term underperformance mentioned earlier.
        *   **Expected Return:** The high expected return (75.8%) suggests that QQQ may be undervalued and could provide significant returns over a longer investment horizon (2+ years), potentially outperforming the S&P 500. However, this is an *expected* return and not guaranteed.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** No analyst consensus information was provided.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

QQQ is a technology-heavy ETF that has recently underperformed the S&P 500. While its long-term expected return is high, there are several short-term and medium-term concerns:

*   **Valuation:** The Nasdaq being at an all-time high raises concerns about potential overvaluation. The RSI approaching overbought territory further reinforces this concern.
*   **Underperformance:** The negative alpha and recent decline in relative divergence highlight its underperformance compared to its benchmark.
*   **Volatility:** The higher beta indicates that QQQ is more volatile than the overall market, meaning it can experience larger price swings.
*   **Alternative Investments:** The news highlighting potentially "better" ETFs suggests that investors should explore other options and not blindly invest in QQQ.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a **neutral to cautious** stance on QQQ seems appropriate. The positive PPO and the high expected return are encouraging, but the valuation concerns, recent underperformance, and high volatility warrant careful consideration.

**Before investing in QQQ, investors should:**

*   **Conduct thorough due diligence:** Research the specific holdings of the fund and assess their individual valuations.
*   **Consider their risk tolerance:** QQQ is a volatile investment, so it is not suitable for risk-averse investors.
*   **Diversify their portfolio:** Do not put all their eggs in one basket. Diversify across different asset classes and sectors.
*   **Monitor the market:** Keep an eye on news and events that could impact the performance of QQQ and the technology sector.
