**5. 종합 Conclusion**

QQQ has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, as evidenced by the negative divergence, although it has a high expectation return from now. While the technical indicators suggest positive momentum, the high RSI value indicates that this might be short lived.
Recent news indicates a mixed market environment with potential risks, notably the government shutdown fears.  The high MRI suggests a favorable market for investment, but investors should proceed with caution, considering the mixed signals and potential for short-term volatility. While the long-term expected return is attractive, the high MDD and potentially high beta mean the index is very volatile.
