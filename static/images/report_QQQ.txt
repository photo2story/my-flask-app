## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Investment Review

This report analyzes the performance of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, a market-capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.


**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

QQQ's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **QQQ Cumulative Return:** 102.43%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 87.98%
* **Return Difference:** 14.45%

The relative divergence of 34.7% indicates that QQQ's performance is currently positioned in the upper 34.7th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO.  While this suggests relatively strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember this is a relative measure based on past data and not a guarantee of future returns.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha (outperformance relative to the benchmark) and beta (volatility relative to the benchmark) over the years.  While recent years show a positive alpha, suggesting outperformance, the significant fluctuations highlight the risk associated with this ETF.  The high beta values consistently show higher volatility than the market. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) of QQQ has also grown substantially over the analyzed period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 35.0% | 54.6% | 2.0% | 0.1 | 90.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 26.0% | 62.7% | 5.0% | -0.0 | 90.8 |
| 2017-2019  | 45.0% | 62.7% | 12.0% | 0.8 | 126.1 |
| 2018-2020  | 62.0% | 62.7% | 32.0% | 0.7 | 187.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 104.0% | 60.9% | 44.0% | 0.7 | 238.5 |
| 2020-2022  | -4.0% | 65.3% | -13.0% | 0.7 | 160.8 |
| 2021-2023  | -5.0% | 70.3% | -25.0% | 1.1 | 249.0 |
| 2022-2024  | -1.0% | 70.7% | -21.0% | 1.1 | 312.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 33.0% | 70.7% | 6.0% | 1.1 | 299.1 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $488.29
* **Last Market Price:** $487.97 (a slight decrease of $0.07 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $485.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $465.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $480.80

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but significantly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting recent upward momentum.  The small daily price drop is not significant enough to indicate a major trend reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 77.13 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.84 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 24.4% (This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term investment.)


The high RSI value indicates that QQQ might be overbought in the short term, increasing the likelihood of a price correction. However, the positive PPO and the significant difference between the closing price and the 20-day moving average are positive signals. The expected return suggests significant potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term.  The small price drop in the last market data is not dramatic and doesn't suggest any immediate 급반등 (sharp rebound) or 급하락 (sharp decline).

**Conclusion:**

QQQ has historically shown strong performance compared to the S&P 500, though this outperformance is not consistent across all periods.  Current indicators suggest a potential for short-term correction due to overbought conditions, but the long-term outlook, based on the expected return, remains positive.  Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon when making decisions about QQQ.  The high volatility, as indicated by the beta, must also be factored into investment strategy.
