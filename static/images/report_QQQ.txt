**Performance Analysis:**

The table below shows the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and market capitalization (Cap) of QQQ over different periods.  QQQ consistently outperforms the market (Beta > 1) in most periods, highlighted by significant alpha in recent years.

The high Beta reflects the volatility inherent in the Nasdaq-100.

**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 472.70
* **Last Market Price:** 477.63 (1.04% increase from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** 475.31
* **20-day Moving Average:** 480.05
* **60-day Moving Average:** 506.77

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, the last market price shows a slight upward movement.

**Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Low Risk)
* **RSI:** 47.87 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so.)
* **PPO:** 0.0586 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum, but weak.)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -3.6% (Short-term downward trend)

The indicators paint a mixed picture. While the MRI suggests low risk, the RSI and relative divergence point towards a slight bearish trend. The positive PPO suggests some upward momentum, however it is weak.  The small price increase in the last market data suggests a minor upward correction, and is not indicative of a major shift.

**Expected Return:**

The provided expected return of 18.4% is considerably higher than what could reasonably be expected. This needs to be considered within the context of the risk involved.  The high expected return relative to VOO (S&P 500) reflects the potential for higher growth and higher risk associated with the technology sector's concentration within QQQ. This 18.4% figure should be treated cautiously, and is likely to be far more volatile than VOO's return.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy could potentially mitigate this volatility. However, it is crucial to consider your individual risk tolerance before investing.
