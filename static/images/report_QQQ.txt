**Company Overview:** Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, providing exposure to large and mid-cap companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.


**Performance Analysis:**

The provided data shows that QQQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, with a cumulative return exceeding that of VOO by 32.8 percentage points. The relative divergence of 63.3% highlights that this outperformance is considerably above average compared to historical data.

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance relative to the market (VOO).  While positive Alpha values in several periods (2017-2021) indicate outperformance, negative Alpha in 2020-2022 shows underperformance.  The Beta consistently hovers around 1, signifying a relatively high correlation with the overall market, though there's a notable jump to 1.0 and 1.1 in the most recent periods, suggesting a heightened sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the years reflects QQQ's growth and increasing market influence.


**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $472.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $475.31
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $480.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $506.77

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.  The recent price increase from the previous close ($468.92 to $472.70) is a relatively small, positive change, and while not classified as a rapid surge, it indicates some positive market sentiment.

**Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 47.87 (Approaching oversold territory; values below 30 are generally considered oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.0586 (Slightly positive, indicating a bullish trend but not a strong one)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.6% (Short-term downward trend)


**Expected Return and Conclusion:**

The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of 18.4% exceeds the expected return of the S&P 500, suggesting a potential for outperformance. However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The current indicators show a mixed bagâ€”the positive expected return is tempered by a recent downward trend in price and approaching oversold RSI.  The relatively high Beta also highlights the risk associated with QQQ's exposure to market fluctuations.  Further analysis, including consideration of broader economic factors and individual company performance within the Nasdaq-100, is recommended before making investment decisions.
