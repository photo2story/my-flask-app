## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Report

**1. Performance Overview & Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, providing exposure to large and medium-sized companies listed on the Nasdaq.

The cumulative return of QQQ is 80.76%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 72.42%.  The difference is 8.34%, placing the current relative divergence at the 25.5th percentile of historical ranges (min: -8.6%, max: 57.7%).  This suggests QQQ's outperformance is relatively moderate compared to its historical performance range against VOO.

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals varying performance characteristics over different periods.  While alpha values are generally positive, suggesting outperformance relative to the market,  they fluctuate significantly.  Beta values consistently hover around 1.1, indicating higher volatility compared to the overall market. The market capitalization (Cap) shows consistent growth over the years.  Note that CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values are important risk metrics to consider alongside alpha and beta.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $433.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $447.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $457.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $491.28

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend.  The significant gap between the current price and the moving averages (especially the 60-day) suggests potential for further downside. The last market's closing price shows a noticeable drop of $2.47 (-0.56%) compared to the previous day.  This should be considered a fairly large decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)  The MRI suggests a moderate risk level.
* **RSI:** 39.82 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)  A low RSI indicates potential for a bounce back. However, confirmation is needed before a buy signal can be interpreted.
* **PPO:** 0.03 (Close to zero, indicating neutrality)  The PPO is near zero, suggesting a lack of a strong momentum in either direction.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -4.5%  This indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 38.9% (over S&P 500) This implies a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  However, this is an *expected* return, and actual results can vary considerably.


**Conclusion:**

QQQ has historically outperformed VOO, although the recent performance has been less impressive, with the price currently trading below its moving averages.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions (RSI), but a lack of strong momentum (PPO).  While the expected long-term return is positive, the high beta implies increased risk and volatility.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing.  Further analysis, including fundamental analysis and consideration of broader market conditions, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
