The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bullish trend. However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term bearish trend or a potential correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk) – suggests a moderate level of risk associated with the current market conditions.

* **RSI:** 44.32 – This is below 50, indicating a bearish or potentially oversold market.  However, it’s not extremely low, suggesting the potential for further decline.

* **PPO:** 0.32 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although the value is relatively low, indicating the strength isn't overpowering.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3 – Shows a recent short-term downward trend relative to the benchmark.

* **Expected Return:** 32.8% – This represents a significant potential outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming consistent outperformance similar to historical patterns.  This prediction should be treated with caution, as past performance does not guarantee future results.  Market conditions can change significantly.

**Conclusion:**

QQQ shows a history of outperforming the S&P 500, but recent performance has been mixed. Current indicators suggest moderate risk, with a potentially bearish short-term outlook but longer term potential for higher returns than the S&P 500 based on the provided expected return.  Further analysis, including consideration of broader market conditions and individual company performance within the QQQ, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return should be viewed with skepticism, as it is based on historical data and may not be realistic in the future.
