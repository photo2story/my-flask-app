*   **Hybrid Signal:** Aggressively recommending buying the stock (no cash allocation), considering it safe (MRI = 0.9).
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term underperformance compared to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return suggests that the model anticipates QQQ will outperform the S&P 500 significantly over the long term, despite the recent underperformance.
