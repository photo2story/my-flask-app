QQQ has shown strong historical growth, but its recent performance has been more volatile with negative alpha compared to the S&P 500. While the current price is showing a positive change, and the MRI is at a medium level, the high MDD and the negative alpha in recent periods are concerning.
While the recent news cycle presents some positive catalysts like the easing of trade tensions, a rebound in the equities markets, and the positive outlook for ETFs, there are risks involved. Given the recent volatility of QQQ, the hybrid signal is signaling a buy with caution. Therefore, potential investors should proceed cautiously, carefully considering their risk tolerance and investment horizon.
