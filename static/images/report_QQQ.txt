Okay, here's a breakdown of the QQQ analysis, combining the provided data points into a cohesive report.

**QQQ Analysis**

**0. Introduction**

This report analyzes the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), comparing its performance to the S&P 500 (VOO), examining key financial metrics, recent stock price movements, technical indicators, and relevant news.  The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview for potential investment decisions.

**1. Return Rate Comparison (QQQ vs. VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** QQQ
*   **Company Name:** Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1
*   **Overview:**  QQQ is an ETF that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, primarily composed of large-cap growth stocks, heavily weighted towards technology companies.
*   **QQQ Cumulative Return:** 98.01%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 103.21%
*   **Divergence (QQQ - VOO):** -5.0
*   **Divergence Range:** Max: 49.2, Min: -8.5
*   **Relative Divergence:** 6.1

**Analysis:**

QQQ has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) based on cumulative return over the analyzed period. The divergence of -5.0 means QQQ's cumulative return is 5 percentage points lower than VOO's.  A relative divergence of 6.1 suggests the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range, implying potential for QQQ to catch up, *but* it's not a guarantee.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| :----------- | :------ | :------ | :------- | :----- | :------ |

| 2023-2025  | 57.0%   | 79.8%   | -10.0%   | 1.1   | 403.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows strong performance in earlier periods, but more recently shows either negative growth or high growth (2023-2025)
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown indicates significant potential for losses (high risk).
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha has been largely negative in recent years. A negative alpha suggests QQQ has underperformed its benchmark (risk-adjusted).
*   **Beta:** Beta values are consistently increasing, meaning QQQ's volatility is rising compared to the market. A Beta near 1.0 indicates that QQQ moves largely in sync with the Nasdaq-100 but with an increasing volatility.
*   **Cap(B):** Cap (Billions) show steady rise of Market Cap, indicating investor confidence in adding stocks to the ETF.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 623.8900146484375
*   **Last-market:** `{'price': 623.89, 'previousClose': 623.93, 'change': -0.01}`
*   **5-day SMA:** 621.238
*   **20-day SMA:** 619.4435
*   **60-day SMA:** 613.8029

**Analysis:**

QQQ's current price is slightly below the previous close, and all the Moving Averages are below the most recent close price, which suggests a short term upward trend. This suggests a potential short-term bullish signal, but further observation is needed.

**3. RSI, PPO Index and Hybrid Signal**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 48.62 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.091
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.6 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 80.8

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI suggests favorable market conditions for investment, BUT needs to be considered alongside other indicators
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 48.62 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:**  A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, but 0.091 is quite low.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** A "Buy" signal suggests the system currently favors accumulating more QQQ.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The short-term increase in relative divergence is a positive signal, aligning with the recent price movement analysis.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 80.8% is extremely high and warrants skepticism. This suggests a significant potential upside if the projections hold true.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Data not provided. Need information here to complete the analysis.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

QQQ has underperformed VOO in cumulative returns. However, recent price action, the PPO, and short-term divergence changes suggest potential for QQQ to recover. The high expected return is a significant positive, but it needs to be carefully considered.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Mixed Signals:** The analysis presents mixed signals. The high MRI conflicts somewhat with the underperformance relative to VOO.
*   **High Risk:** QQQ's historical volatility (Beta) and Maximum Drawdown remain high.
*   **Sector Concentration:** QQQ is heavily weighted in technology, making it susceptible to sector-specific risks.
*   **Analyst Consensus:** Lacking analyst consensus makes the investment decision difficult.
*   **News Flow:** The news articles show a range of opinions, from bullish to cautious, requiring investors to do their own due diligence.

**Recommendation:**

A cautious approach is advised. Given the high volatility, underperformance compared to VOO, and mixed news flow, a small allocation to QQQ may be considered for investors with a high-risk tolerance. Monitor the fund's performance, news, and analyst ratings closely. The high expected return, while attractive, should be viewed with skepticism until further supporting data is available. It would be helpful to see Analyst Opinions and compare this to similar tech ETFs.
