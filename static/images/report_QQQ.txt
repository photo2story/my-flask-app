Here's a comprehensive analysis of QQQ, incorporating the provided data:

**1) QQQ vs. S&P 500 (VOO) Performance Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1) is an ETF that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, primarily focusing on large-cap growth stocks in the technology sector.
*   **Cumulative Return:**
    *   QQQ: 97.28%
    *   VOO (S&P 500): 101.92%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -6.6
    *   Relative Divergence: 3.1 (Near the low end of its historical divergence range compared to VOO)
*   **Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD:**
    *   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, with strong growth periods (2017-2021) and periods of decline (2020-2024), reflecting the volatility of the tech sector.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a strong rebound.
    *   **MDD:**  Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant risk and price volatility.
    *   **Alpha:**  Positive Alpha values during growth periods (2015-2019) suggest QQQ outperformed its benchmark (risk-adjusted). Negative Alpha in recent years shows underperformance. Notably, the 2023-2025 period has a negative Alpha despite a strong CAGR, suggesting the S&P 500 also performed exceptionally well.
    *   **Beta:** High and increasing Beta values (approaching 1.1) indicate QQQ's price movements are becoming increasingly correlated with, and more volatile than, the broader market.
    *   **Cap(B):**  Shows a generally upward trend in market capitalization over the periods analyzed.

**Simple Analysis:** While QQQ showed strong outperformance in the past, particularly between 2017 and 2021, recent years (2020-2024) saw significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The high MDD and increasing Beta underscore the ETF's inherent volatility. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a strong recovery in CAGR, but the negative Alpha suggests the S&P 500 performed similarly well.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 619.25, Previous Close: 614.27, Change: 0.81

    *   20-day SMA: 611.91
    *   60-day SMA: 605.01

**Simple Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The 5-day SMA being the lowest and the 60-day SMA in the middle might mean the price momentum is increasing at a moderate rate.

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -3.7 (Negative trend in divergence relative to the S&P 500)
*   **Expected Return:** 178.5% (Long-term, projected outperformance of S&P 500)

**Simple Analysis:** The MRI suggests a favorable environment for investment. The RSI is neutral, the PPO is slightly positive, and the expected return is very high, indicating potential for substantial long-term gains. However, the recent negative divergence indicates some short-term underperformance against the S&P 500, which needs to be watched out for.
