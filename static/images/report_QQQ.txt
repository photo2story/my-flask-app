## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Report

**Executive Summary:** Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, providing exposure to large-cap growth companies in the technology sector.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

QQQ's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **QQQ Cumulative Return:** 85.20%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 76.08%
* **Return Difference:** 9.12%

This difference places QQQ at the 26.7th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the VOO (ranging from -8.6% to 57.7%).  While currently outperforming, historical context suggests this level of outperformance isn't extremely unusual.


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance relative to the market (S&P 500) across different periods.  While Alpha is generally positive, indicating outperformance, it fluctuates considerably.  Beta, consistently around 1.1, signifies higher volatility than the market.  The high CAGR in some periods is counterbalanced by periods of negative returns, emphasizing the risk associated with this investment.  The significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlights the potential for substantial losses.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $444.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $452.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $461.74
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $494.37

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The relatively large negative change from the previous close (-3.02) indicates a recent sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 39.45 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.23 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -3.9% (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 36.6% (This represents expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term investment.  This is a significant figure but should be viewed cautiously given the inherent uncertainty in any long-term projection.)


**Conclusion:**

QQQ shows a higher cumulative return than VOO, but this outperformance is not consistently maintained across all periods.  The current price is in a downtrend, and while some indicators suggest potential oversold conditions, the risk remains elevated due to high volatility and recent sharp declines.  The projected long-term excess return is promising, but investors should carefully consider the historical volatility and risk profile before investing. The significant negative price change from the previous close warrants further investigation into potential market-moving events.
