*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization increases over the 2015-2025 period.

**Analysis of Alpha and Beta Table:**

*   The table reveals a concerning trend. While QQQ demonstrated strong growth and outperformance (positive Alpha) in the 2015-2021 period, recent performance (2020-2025) shows negative Alpha, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark.
*   The consistently high MDD values indicate significant risk and volatility associated with QQQ.
*   The increasing Beta suggests that QQQ's price movements are becoming more correlated with, and more sensitive to, the overall market.
*   The decrease in alpha and increase in beta may indicate that QQQ does not reflect a good investment opportunity.

*   **Previous Close:** 609.11
*   **Change:** 1.3%
*   **SMA Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is also around the 60-day SMA. This is a *mixed* signal.

*   **RSI:** 45.36.  This is in the neutral zone, not overbought or oversold.
*   **PPO:** -0.21. This suggests that the stock price trend is slightly downward.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash". This signal suggests a strong buy signal based on the model, highlighting the safety of the investment with a high MRI score of 0.9.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -5.1, indicating a recent short-term decline.
*   **Price Change:** The 1.3% change from the previous close is noticeable and should be considered as a factor.
*   **Expected Return:** A 101.1% expected return (over 2 years) is highly optimistic, but it must be read carefully in light of the other indicators, namely decreased alpha and increased beta.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

QQQ presents a mixed picture. While it has demonstrated historical outperformance, recent data shows underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high volatility, and a negative Alpha. The increasing Beta suggests a greater sensitivity to market movements.

The current price is trading near the 20-day and 60-day SMA. The MRI suggests medium investment, but the recent decline in divergence and the factors mentioned in the news, especially "AI Blues" and rate cut uncertainty, indicate caution.

The hybrid signal recommending a strong buy based on the MRI may be optimistic, but is offset by other factors.

**Recommendation:**

Given the recent underperformance, increasing Beta, negative Alpha, high MDD, mixed SMA signals, and the news highlighting sector-specific risks, a *cautious approach is warranted*. While the hybrid signal suggests a strong buy, the overall data paints a more nuanced picture.

Before investing, it's crucial to:

1.  **Monitor News:** Closely follow news related to the Nasdaq-100 index, AI sector, and interest rate developments.
2.  **Consider Risk Tolerance:**  QQQ appears to be a riskier investment than a broad market ETF like VOO.  Ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance.
3.  **Consult Financial Advisor:** Consider discussing your investment strategy with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your financial situation and goals.
