**Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.47 (Approaching oversold territory; typically below 30 is considered oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.1937 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.6% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 37.1% over the long term (2+ years). This is a forecast and not a guarantee.

**Conclusion:**

QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance has lagged. While the long-term expected return remains positive relative to the S&P 500, current indicators suggest a potential for further short-term price decline. The medium market risk rating and relatively low RSI suggest caution.  Further analysis of the underlying holdings and market conditions is recommended before making investment decisions.
