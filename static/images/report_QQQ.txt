**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $519.87
* **Previous Close:** $526.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $532.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $527.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $522.02

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent closing price shows a small decline from the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.55 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.15 (Negative; suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 12.1% over the long term (2+ years)

The combination of a negative PPO and a negative relative divergence change indicates a weakening short-term trend. However, the RSI suggests the market is not extremely oversold.  The significant price drop from the previous day (-$1.18) should be considered when assessing the current market conditions. This small drop is in line with the overall downward trend, however, more data would be needed to determine whether this was a "급반등" (sharp rebound) or "급하락" (sharp decline) event.   The long-term expected return of 12.1% relative to the S&P 500 suggests continued outperformance potential if the current negative short term trend reverses.


**Conclusion:**

While QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting strong alpha, the recent price action and indicators suggest a potential short-term bearish trend.  The long-term outlook remains positive, based on the historical data and the projected expected return.  However, investors should monitor the market closely and consider the recent negative price movement.
