**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

QQQ's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a QQQ cumulative return of 182.94% compared to VOO's 114.36%. This results in a raw return difference of 68.6 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 93.6% indicates QQQ's performance is in the top 93.6% percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR data further supports this superior performance, although recent years show more volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last reported data point, QQQ closed at $516.47.  The short-term price action shows:

* **5-day moving average:** $529.49  (slightly above the closing price, suggesting recent downward pressure)
* **20-day moving average:** $518.45 (above the closing price, also suggesting recent downward pressure)
* **60-day moving average:** $502.61 (significantly below the closing price, indicating a recent upward trend)


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (57.34):** Suggests the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in neutral territory.
* **PPO (-0.0026):**  A slightly negative value indicates a weak bearish momentum.  This is consistent with the moving average data points.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (0.5+):** Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (54.6%):** This is a substantial long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500.  However, it is crucial to note that this is based on previous performance and does not guarantee future returns.  The high expected return might be impacted by the inherent volatility of the Nasdaq-100.

**4. Financial Information:**

No detailed financial trends are available, limiting the analysis of QQQ's underlying financial health and fundamentals.  This is a significant limitation in a comprehensive investment analysis.

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided data lacks information on recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions.  This is crucial information that needs to be obtained from other sources before making investment decisions.  Without up-to-date news, a complete assessment is impossible.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, indicated by a strong cumulative return and high relative divergence. However, recent short-term price action suggests a potential cooling of this outperformance. The positive expected return remains appealing for long-term investors but must be tempered by the lack of fundamental financial information and the absence of recent news affecting the ETF. The absence of recent market outlook, earnings news, and analyst opinions significantly hinders a comprehensive risk assessment.  Further investigation is required into these areas to solidify an investment recommendation.  The current price of $516.47 does not significantly differ from the moving averages, though the short-term moving average suggests that a correction may occur before the next leg up, especially considering the PPO is slightly negative.
