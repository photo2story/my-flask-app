Negative beta is very unusual and suggests an inverse relationship, which warrants further investigation if accurate. It indicates QQQ moved to opposite side of the market movement.

*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is very high in recent periods, indicating significant potential losses from peak to trough.
*   **Cap:** Market capitalization has generally increased over time, indicating growth in the underlying holdings.
