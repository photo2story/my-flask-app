## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Performance Review

This report analyzes the performance of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, a market-capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

QQQ's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **QQQ Cumulative Return:** 125.27%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 91.19%
* **Return Difference:** 34.1%
* **Relative Divergence:** 65.1% (This indicates QQQ's performance is in the upper 65.1% percentile relative to VOO's performance over the observed period, considering the historical minimum and maximum divergence.)

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows that QQQ generally outperforms the market (Beta > 1) particularly in recent years (2021-2025), with positive alpha values signifying outperformance beyond what's expected from its beta.  However, the CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) vary significantly across different periods. The high MDD in some periods highlights the volatility associated with this technology-heavy index.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the growth of the companies within the Nasdaq-100.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $481.62
* **Last Market Price:** $466.23 (a decrease of $0.58 from the previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $486.05
* **20-day Moving Average:** $484.45
* **60-day Moving Average:** $508.84

The last market price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. The price drop of $0.58 is relatively minor and does not signify a significant immediate market event like a sharp drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.84 (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting a slightly bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.39 (Positive, indicating a bullish trend but it's not extraordinarily strong.)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (Indicates short-term upward momentum).
* **Expected Return:** 17.4% (This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) given a continued investment strategy. It needs to be evaluated against the associated risk.)


**Conclusion:**

QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting higher returns but also higher volatility. While recent price action shows a slight downward trend, the long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, remains positive relative to the S&P 500. The relatively low RSI and MRI suggest a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance.  However, it's crucial to monitor market conditions and consider diversification strategies.  The provided data is a snapshot in time and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.
