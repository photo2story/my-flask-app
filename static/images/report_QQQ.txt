## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Report

This report analyzes the performance of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index,  a market-capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.


**1. Performance Analysis:**

QQQ's cumulative return is 69.76%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 55.58%. The difference is 14.2 percentage points.  Considering the historical range of this difference (max: 62.8%, min: -8.2%), QQQ's current outperformance sits at the 31.5th percentile. This suggests that while QQQ has outperformed VOO,  its current outperformance is not at an extreme level compared to its historical performance relative to VOO.

The provided CAGR, MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, and Beta data showcase varying performance across different time periods.  Alpha values generally indicate outperformance relative to the benchmark (positive Alpha) or underperformance (negative Alpha).  While some periods show strong positive Alpha and CAGR (e.g., 2019-2021), recent years (2021-2025) show negative or low CAGR and increased Beta, indicating higher market sensitivity and potentially lower outperformance against the benchmark in those time frames.  The increasing Beta suggests increased volatility and correlation with the overall market.  The significant Market Capitalization (Cap(B)) growth shows the fund's overall growth in assets.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $424.09
* **Last Market Price:** $423.87 (Slight increase of $0.04 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $449.25
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $471.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $501.82

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The recent small increase is not significant enough to indicate a major reversal of this trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)  The MRI suggests a high-risk environment.
* **RSI:** 27.29 (Oversold)  A low RSI indicates the stock might be oversold, potentially signaling a bounce.
* **PPO:** -1.01 (Bearish)  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.5 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 41.4% (Long-term, 2+ years, exceeding S&P 500) This suggests a significant potential for outperformance over the long run.


**Conclusion:**

While QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, recent performance has been weaker, and the current price is below key moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  Technical indicators show mixed signals.  The high MRI suggests caution. However, the long-term expected return remains strong, suggesting that a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy might still be viable, particularly for investors with a higher risk tolerance.  The recent small price increase is not significant enough to alter the overall bearish outlook indicated by the technical indicators and moving averages. Further monitoring of market conditions and technical indicators is recommended.
