The QQQ, tracking the Nasdaq-100, has recently shown positive momentum, trading above its short-term moving averages with a recent price increase. However, it has underperformed the S&P 500 over the longer term. The data indicates the trend might be reversing.

The MRI is high, indicating the data points towards a good time to invest, while the RSI is neutral. The PPO suggests some upward momentum.  The hybrid signal is a strong buy, recommending fully investing available cash. The recent change in relative divergence further supports the current positive trend.

The news articles present a mixed picture. On one hand, institutional buying and the potential for a 30% gain are positive.  On the other hand, concerns about overvaluation and Nasdaq-100 rebalancing introduce some caution. The high maximum drawdown figures also suggest a higher risk profile.
