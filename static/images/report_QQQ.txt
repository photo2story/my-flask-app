**Conclusion:**

While QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly, exhibiting a strong alpha, current technical indicators (RSI, PPO, and price action relative to moving averages) suggest a bearish short-term outlook. The recent price drop (-$4.25) further supports this conclusion. However, a long-term perspective (2+ years) suggests a positive outlook with a projected significant return surpassing the S&P 500.  Investors should consider both the short-term risks and the long-term potential when making investment decisions.
