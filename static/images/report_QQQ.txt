**Conclusion:**

QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting strong growth and high CAGRs. However, recent price action shows a downward trend, supported by technical indicators. While the long-term outlook (based on the provided 14.7% expected return) remains positive, short-term volatility and the recent price drop warrant caution. Further research into the reasons for the recent price decrease (of $5.61) is necessary. The substantial difference between the current price and the moving averages suggest a period of potential price consolidation or even a further downward trend in the short term.
