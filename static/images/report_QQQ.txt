**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), tracking the Nasdaq-100 index, is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) providing exposure to 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

The cumulative return of QQQ is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a QQQ cumulative return of 188.41% versus 122.19% for VOO.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha values, suggesting QQQ has outperformed its benchmark by an average of 0.4%.

It's critical to understand the implications of such low beta values and investigate their underlying causes.
