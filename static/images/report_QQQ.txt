**Company Overview:**

Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, providing exposure to a large selection of leading technology and growth companies.


**Performance Analysis (compared to VOO):**

QQQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, showing a substantially higher cumulative return.  The relative divergence of 89.3% highlights the strength of this outperformance relative to its historical range.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  Generally, QQQ demonstrates a beta greater than 1, indicating higher volatility than the market (VOO).  The alpha values fluctuate, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  The consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) highlights the strong long-term growth potential, however, the significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in some periods underscores the inherent risk associated with this investment. The rising market cap (Cap(B)) reflects the growth in the underlying Nasdaq-100 companies.


**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $522.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $520.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $518.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $515.64

The price is slightly below the recent moving averages, suggesting a minor downward trend in the short term.  The small negative change from the previous close (-$0.15) doesn't signal a significant price movement (neither a sharp increase nor decrease).


**Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (61.29):**  The RSI is above 50, indicating a slightly bullish trend. However, it's not significantly overbought, suggesting further upside potential is possible.
* **PPO (0.03):** A positive PPO value suggests a bullish momentum.  The value is relatively low, suggesting momentum may not be extremely strong.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-2.3%):** The recent negative change in relative divergence (-2.3%) suggests a minor short-term weakening in QQQ's performance relative to VOO.


**Expected Return and Conclusion:**

The projected 12% outperformance over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment reflects the expectation of continued strong growth from the technology sector represented in QQQ.  However, investors should be aware of the higher volatility inherent in technology stocks and the potential for significant drawdowns as indicated by past MDD data.  A diversified investment strategy is always recommended.  Thorough due diligence and consideration of personal risk tolerance are essential before investing in QQQ.
