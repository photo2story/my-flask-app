*   **Long-Term:** The high expected return suggests QQQ may still be a worthwhile long-term investment, especially if you believe in the growth potential of the Nasdaq-100 companies. Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate short-term volatility.
*   **Consider the News:** Be mindful of the potential impact of tariff talks and broader market sentiment on QQQ.
