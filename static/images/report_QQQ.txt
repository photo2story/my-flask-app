## Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index,  invests in the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

The cumulative return for QQQ is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  Specifically:

* **QQQ Cumulative Return:** 186.44%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 117.56%
* **Return Difference:** 68.9%

The relative divergence of 94% indicates QQQ's performance has been substantially above the S&P 500 over the period considered, placing it in the top decile of historical performance relative to VOO.  However, this is a backward-looking metric and doesn't predict future performance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha (outperformance relative to the benchmark) and a beta close to 0.  This suggests that QQQ has historically delivered excess returns (Alpha) while exhibiting low correlation with the broader market (Beta near zero is unusual for this type of ETF and should be examined closely for potential data issues).  It's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results. The high CAGR values need to be interpreted carefully in the context of market conditions during those time periods.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 36.0% | 0.5% | 7.0% | 0.4 | 0.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 26.0% | 7.3% | 8.0% | 0.4 | 0.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 46.0% | 7.3% | 16.0% | 0.4 | 0.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 76.0% | 7.3% | 48.0% | 0.4 | 0.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 124.0% | 7.0% | 53.0% | 0.4 | 0.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -2.0% | 13.1% | -11.0% | 0.4 | 0.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 18.0% | 13.1% | -5.0% | 0.4 | 0.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 52.0% | 13.1% | 17.0% | 0.4 | 0.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Closing Price:** $522.87
* **Last Market Price:** $529.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $521.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $520.54
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $504.17

The price is slightly above the short-term moving averages, suggesting a relatively stable trend.  The gap between the last market price and the closing price ($7.09) needs further investigation to determine if this is a typical daily fluctuation or an indicator of a significant event.


**3. Technical Indicators & Divergence:**

* **RSI:** 53.97 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.28 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.3% (Short-term downward trend)

The relatively low PPO and negative divergence suggest bearish momentum, despite the RSI remaining in neutral territory. The price of 529.96 being higher than the closing price suggests a potential for short-term upward movement, but this may be temporary and it’s important not to read too much into daily fluctuations.


**Expected Return:**  A 54.6% expected return over a long-term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a bold claim and requires significantly more supporting data.  This figure should be treated with caution unless a detailed model justifying this projection is provided.

**4.  Financial Information:**

No detailed financial trends are available.  Further research using financial data providers is needed to understand the QQQ's financial health and sustainability.

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided data lacks recent news, earnings announcements, market outlooks, and analyst opinions.  Accessing real-time financial news sources is crucial for a complete analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting periods of strong growth and relatively low volatility as per the data provided. However, recent indicators (negative PPO and negative divergence) suggest some bearish momentum in the short-term.  The lack of detailed financial data and recent news limits the scope of this analysis.  The high CAGR needs to be viewed within the context of risk and market conditions.  It’s crucial to conduct thorough due diligence, including examining the underlying holdings of QQQ and considering current market conditions, before making any investment decisions.  The predicted expected return should be viewed with significant skepticism without a supporting financial model.  Finally, the Beta near 0 in the table deserves further investigation as it is unusual for a Nasdaq-100 tracking ETF.
