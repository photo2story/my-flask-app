QQQ presents a mixed picture. While it has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, technical indicators suggest a possible short-term uptrend and a strong long-term expected return. The news is also a mix of positive and cautionary signals.

The fund's modernization and dividend increase are positive developments, while the positive economic data is benefiting the overall market, including QQQ.

The high maximum drawdown also needs to be considered.
