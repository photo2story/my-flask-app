**Investment Recommendation (Disclaimer: This is not financial advice):**

Given QQQ's historical outperformance and the optimistic expected return, it could be a valuable addition to a long-term investment portfolio.

The Hybrid Signal suggests it's a good time to buy into the stock. Based on low MRI, recent price action, and the relative deviation changes, I would be a little bit careful about purchasing this stock.
