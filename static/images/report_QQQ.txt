## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Performance Review

This report analyzes the performance of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, a market-capitalization-weighted index of 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

QQQ's cumulative return is 85.27%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 76.31%.  The difference is 9.0 percentage points, placing it at the 26.5th percentile of historical divergence based on a range of 57.7% (max) to -8.6% (min).

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows mixed results. While QQQ consistently shows a positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) from 2017-2021, suggesting skillful management or exposure to factors beyond broad market movements, recent years (2021-2025) show declining CAGR and a negative alpha. Beta values fluctuate but generally indicate higher volatility than the market (above 1.0).  The large swings in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlight the inherent risk associated with QQQ, particularly its concentration in growth stocks.  Note the significant increase in market capitalization (Cap) over time, reflecting the growth of the underlying companies within the Nasdaq-100.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $444.48
* **5-day Moving Average:** $444.77
* **20-day Moving Average:** $455.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** $489.88

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent price change shows a 2.63 increase from the previous close, indicating a mild upward move.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)  The MRI suggests moderate risk.
* **RSI:** 42.31 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.11 (Positive, but relatively low, indicating weak momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.9 (Short-term bearish trend)

The combination of RSI below 50, a low PPO, and a negative relative divergence points towards a bearish trend. However, the recent positive price change of 2.63, while not significant in itself, does slightly contradict these indicators and might represent a minor bounce.

The expected return of 36.8% over the long term (2+ years) represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. This should be considered in light of the higher risk profile of QQQ, as indicated by the higher beta and recent underperformance.  The high expected return highlights the potential for significant growth but also implies the possibility of substantial losses if the underlying growth stocks underperform.
