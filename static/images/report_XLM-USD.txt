## XLM-USD (Stellar) Stock Report

**Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** XLM-USD
* **Company:** Stellar Development Foundation (a decentralized payment network)
* **Cumulative Return:** 196.98%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 96.90%
* **Return Difference:** 100.1% (Relative Divergence: 11.9%)


**Analysis:**

XLM-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, exhibiting a cumulative return almost double that of the benchmark.  However, the provided alpha and beta data reveal high volatility and inconsistent performance across different timeframes.  While some periods show substantial positive returns, others demonstrate extremely negative returns (-909%!). This highlights considerable risk associated with this investment.  The relative divergence, though positive, needs to be interpreted cautiously due to the high volatility evident in the CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures.  The relatively high beta values in several periods (1.4, 3.9, 8.2) indicate higher sensitivity to market movements compared to the S&P 500.

**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.335
* **Last Market Price:** $0.336
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.323
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.367
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.397

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change (+5.59%) shows a small short-term bounce.


**Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 37.8 (Slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.22 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** 0.4 (+) (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years):** -183.7% (This is likely a miscalculation or a reflection of the extreme historical volatility.  A negative expected return over the long term is highly unusual and needs further investigation.)


**Overall Assessment:**

The historical data presents a volatile investment with periods of extreme gains and losses. While the recent price increase and the relative strength against the S&P 500 are positive, caution is warranted.  The negative long-term expected return and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum. The high volatility and inconsistent performance necessitates careful risk management and a thorough understanding of the underlying technology and market factors before making any investment decisions. The -183.7% expected return should be critically examined â€“ it likely reflects past volatility and is not a reliable predictor of future performance.  Further research into the fundamentals and the potential long-term growth prospects of the Stellar network is crucial.
