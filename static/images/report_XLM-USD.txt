## XLM-USD: Stellar Lumens Analysis

**0. Overview:**

XLM-USD, Stellar Lumens, is a decentralized protocol enabling cross-asset transfers of value.  This report analyzes its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO) using provided data.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **Cumulative Return (XLM-USD):** 182.31%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 98.02%
* **Return Difference:** 84.3%  (XLM-USD outperformed VOO by 84.3 percentage points).
* **Relative Divergence:** 11.0% (This indicates that the current outperformance is in the 11th percentile of historical maximum and minimum divergence between XLM-USD and VOO.)

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows highly volatile performance, with large swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significant maximum drawdowns (MDD). While recent years show positive CAGR, the earlier years exhibit substantial losses.  The beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying levels of correlation with the market.  It is important to note that this high volatility presents significant risk.  The relatively low alpha values suggest the outperformance compared to VOO may not be solely due to manager skill.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.3185
* **Last Market Price:** $0.3380 (A recent price increase of 6.15%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.3424
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.4035
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.4076

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price increase might be a short-term fluctuation, given the longer-term downward trend suggested by the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 24.41  (Indicates oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a bounce but also vulnerability to further decline)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.94 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.8% (Indicates a recent decline in relative performance against VOO).
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -195.3% (This extremely negative expected return, relative to the S&P 500, highlights significant risk.  The model used for this projection is not included and should be critically examined for validity.)
* **Price Change Note:**  The recent 6.15% price increase might represent a temporary bounce within an overall bearish trend.  More data is needed to confirm this.

**Conclusion:**

XLM-USD has shown periods of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by extreme volatility and substantial drawdowns.  The current technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook, and the projected long-term expected return is drastically negative relative to the S&P 500. Investors should proceed with caution and carefully consider the inherent risks associated with this asset.  The provided expected return is highly concerning and requires careful scrutiny of the underlying model. Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the model used for expected return calculation, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
