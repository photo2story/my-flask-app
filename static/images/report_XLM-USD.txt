**Performance Analysis (vs. S&P 500):**

XLM-USD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, showing a cumulative return of 177.38% compared to VOO's 97.43%.  However, the high relative divergence suggests this outperformance is not consistently maintained and might be subject to significant volatility.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show inconsistent performance relative to the market (S&P 500).  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others exhibit substantially negative alpha and high beta (high volatility and correlation with the market).  The large negative CAGR values in some periods highlight significant drawdowns.  The market capitalization fluctuates considerably across the periods, suggesting significant growth and contraction in the company's valuation.  A deeper analysis of the periods is needed to determine the underlying causes for this significant variation.

**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 0.3129
* **Last Market Price:** 0.3184
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.321
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.3772
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.4006

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent small price increase (0.0073) from the previous close is not enough to suggest a significant trend reversal at this time.

**Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (29.41):**  Indicates the asset is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible, but not guaranteed.
* **PPO (-2.24):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-3.0):**  Shows a recent decrease in the relative strength compared to the benchmark, confirming the downtrend.

**Expected Return and Risk:**

The provided expected return of -202.7% is extremely negative and highly improbable.  This value requires clarification and is likely an error.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy might offer potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500 despite the high volatility. However, this is conditional upon the risk tolerance of the investor and requires further in-depth research into the fundamental business prospects of the underlying company and the overall cryptocurrency market trends.


**Overall Assessment:**

XLM-USD has shown periods of significant outperformance against the S&P 500, but also substantial drawdowns. The high volatility and inconsistent performance highlighted by the alpha and beta values indicate a high-risk investment.  Further research into the company's fundamentals and the cryptocurrency market is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided expected return of -202.7% needs further investigation.  The current technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, but the oversold RSI condition hints at a potential short-term price bounce.
