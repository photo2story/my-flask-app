**Conclusion:**

XLM-USD has shown periods of significant outperformance against the S&P 500, but also extreme volatility and underperformance.  The current price is below its moving averages, and technical indicators suggest bearish momentum.  The extremely negative expected return (-254.7%) requires further investigation and clarification.  The investment decision depends entirely on the risk tolerance of the investor.  A long-term investment strategy could be considered only with thorough due diligence and a complete understanding of the factors driving the -254.7% expected return calculation.
