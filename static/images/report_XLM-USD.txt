**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

XLM-USD (Stellar Lumens) is an open-source, decentralized payment network built on blockchain technology.

The cumulative return of XLM-USD significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by 106.1 percentage points.  However, this is a snapshot in time and historical performance is not indicative of future results. The relative divergence metric suggests that this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance relative to VOO, but not exceptionally so.


**2. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta data show highly volatile performance.  Significant negative CAGR values are interspersed with periods of extreme positive growth.  The high beta values (generally above 1) indicate that XLM-USD's price is more sensitive to market movements than the overall market.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) further highlights the significant risk associated with this investment.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|--------|------|-------|
| 2017-2019  | -192.0%  | 40.8% | -209.0% | -0.0 | 1.3   |
| 2018-2020  | -909.0%  | 40.8% | -937.0% | -0.0 | 3.8   |
| 2019-2021  | 183.0%   | 35.7% | 112.0%  | -0.0 | 7.8   |
| 2020-2022  | 2.0%     | 35.7% | -7.0%  | 0.1  | 2.1   |
| 2021-2023  | -211.0%  | 28.7% | -234.0% | 1.1  | 3.8   |
| 2022-2024  | 114.0%   | 39.2% | 82.0%   | 1.2  | 9.7   |
| 2023-2025  | 224.0%   | 39.2% | 161.0%  | 0.6  | 10.1  |


**3. Recent Price Movement and Technical Indicators:**

The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend. The recent price change shows a small positive increase (1.13%), which is not significant enough to indicate a sudden upward or downward trend.

RSI of 60.95 suggests the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, sitting in neutral territory. The positive PPO value (0.99) indicates a bullish momentum.  The recent relative divergence (0.5) also suggests a short-term upward trend, which is consistent with the PPO value.


**4. Risk and Expected Return:**

The provided expected return of -183% is likely an estimate based on past performance and should not be taken as a reliable prediction of future returns. Given the historical volatility and the significant risk associated with XLM-USD, any long-term investment strategy requires a high risk tolerance. The high volatility suggests that long-term returns, despite the potential for outperformance versus the S&P500, are uncertain.  A diversified portfolio is recommended to mitigate risk.  Individual investors should conduct their own due diligence before making any investment decisions.
