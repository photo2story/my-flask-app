## XLM-USD Stock Report: A Concise Analysis

**0. Key Figures & Summary:**

XLM-USD, Stellar Lumens, is a cryptocurrency facilitating cross-border payments.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO), though volatility is high.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **XLM-USD Cumulative Return:** 164.38%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 94.66%
* **Return Difference:** 69.7%  This indicates XLM-USD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  The relative divergence of 10.2% suggests this outperformance is in the upper decile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500. However, it is crucial to remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future results.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha and beta data reveals highly volatile performance.  High negative CAGR values in several periods indicate significant drawdowns. Positive alpha values in some periods suggest potential outperformance relative to the market, but this is inconsistent and accompanied by very high betas signifying significant market sensitivity and risk. The fluctuating market capitalization also highlights the volatility of this asset.

* **Last Market Change:** -10.56% (Significant daily drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.3274
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.3300

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The significant daily drop warrants further investigation into potential news or market events.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (45.16):**  Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions, but leaning towards bearish territory.
* **PPO (0.12):** A positive value indicates the price is above its 12-day moving average. The value is relatively small, suggesting limited upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-2.4):**  Short-term downward trend.

The large negative change in price (-10.56%) signifies a significant drop, potentially driven by market factors or specific news events affecting XLM-USD.  Further research is needed to pinpoint the cause of this sharp decline.

**Expected Return (-230.8%):**  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and requires further examination of the methodology used to arrive at this figure. It is likely far too pessimistic based on the information provided and strongly cautions against long-term investment based solely on this metric.  High volatility and significant historical drawdowns inherent in XLM-USD must be considered.  A long-term investment in this asset should only be considered by investors with a high-risk tolerance.
