**1. Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

XLM-USD is Stellar, a decentralized open-source network for fast, scalable, and fee-free transactions.  Note that the provided data suggests highly volatile performance with significant periods of both substantial gains and losses. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows wide swings, ranging from massive negative returns to impressive positive returns.  The high negative alpha values in several periods suggest underperformance relative to the market benchmark, despite periods of outperformance as shown in the cumulative return data.  The beta values generally fluctuate around 1, indicating somewhat similar volatility to the market.  The substantial Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.42 also points towards significant volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent closing price is slightly below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term bearish trend. The 60-day moving average is significantly higher, suggesting a longer-term downtrend. The Last-market data shows a small positive change of 2.6% which is not significant enough to suggest a rapid price movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 47.48 is near the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. A PPO of 1.29 indicates some upward momentum, although this should be interpreted cautiously given the overall volatility. The recent relative divergence of -0.1 suggests a short-term downward trend.  The negative expected return of -230.7% is highly concerning and suggests a significant risk to long-term investment relative to the S&P 500. It's crucial to critically assess the reliability of this long-term prediction.

**Conclusion:**

While XLM-USD has shown periods of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, its overall performance is highly volatile and risky. The negative expected return suggests that long-term investment in XLM-USD relative to the S&P 500 carries considerable downside risk.  Further investigation into the underlying factors driving XLM-USD's price fluctuations and a thorough risk assessment are essential before making any investment decisions.  The provided data highlights the high risk associated with this asset, and investors should exercise caution.
