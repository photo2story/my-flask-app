* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -119.5% This figure suggests that while the past performance was markedly different than the S&P 500's performance, a long-term investment in XLM-USD is projected to underperform the S&P 500 significantly over a 2-year period at the current time. This prediction is likely highly sensitive to the volatility of this asset class.


**Conclusion:**

XLM-USD has demonstrated periods of extremely high returns, but also substantial losses. Its high volatility and consistently negative or low Alpha make it a very risky investment. While the current RSI suggests it may be oversold, the negative PPO and expected return indicate a bearish outlook.  The substantial potential for both significant gains and losses makes this an investment suitable only for those with high risk tolerance and a long-term perspective who understand the complexities of the cryptocurrency market.  The negative expected return strongly suggests that  investors should proceed with extreme caution and consider diversifying their portfolios significantly.
