## XLM-USD (Stellar Lumens) Stock Report

**Summary:**  XLM-USD, Stellar Lumens, is a cryptocurrency and decentralized payment network.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

The cumulative return of XLM-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is substantial: 270.05% vs 97.29%, resulting in a gap of 172.8%.  While the relative divergence (16.1%) suggests XLM-USD's performance is in the upper range historically relative to the S&P 500, this is heavily influenced by periods of extreme volatility.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility and inconsistent performance for XLM-USD.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates wildly between periods, ranging from a massive loss of -909% to a significant gain of 288%.  The alpha values, reflecting excess returns over the benchmark, are mostly near zero or slightly positive, but considering the Beta (market risk exposure), this suggests that the high returns are primarily due to taking on substantial risk, rather than consistent alpha generation.  The high Beta values in several periods further confirm this high risk profile. Note the extremely high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicating significant potential losses.

* **RSI (30.37):**  Indicates the asset is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible.
* **PPO (-1.11):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-0.7):** Shows a recent downward trend in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (-119.5%):** This extremely negative value for expected return suggests a considerable downside risk, particularly relative to the S&P 500.  The provided data and analysis suggest considerable uncertainty. A negative expected return of this magnitude is unusual and warrants further investigation.


**Conclusion:**

XLM-USD has shown periods of exceptional growth but also extremely high volatility and risk.  While the current RSI suggests a potential bounce, the overwhelmingly negative expected return and bearish momentum indicators suggest caution.  The high beta and past performance do not guarantee future results and should not be taken as the sole basis for investment decisions.  Long-term investment, as suggested, involves significant risk given the volatility.  Further due diligence and risk assessment are crucial before making any investment decisions. The extremely high negative expected return needs to be carefully analyzed to confirm its accuracy and underlying assumptions.
