## XLM-USD (Stellar Lumens) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

XLM-USD, or Stellar Lumens, is a cryptocurrency and decentralized payment network.  The provided data shows significant volatility and varying performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is required to determine its investment viability.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **XLM-USD Cumulative Return:** 153.85%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 93.55%
* **Return Difference:** 60.3% (The XLM-USD outperformed VOO by 60.3% at the last data point. However, the relative divergence indicator (9.7%) indicates this outperformance is in the lower range of historical variations.)

The provided alpha and beta values indicate a highly volatile investment with significant periods of both substantial gains and losses.  The negative CAGR values in several periods highlight periods of considerable underperformance.  Market capitalization also fluctuates significantly, further underscoring volatility.


**Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**

The table shows inconsistent performance. While there are periods of high positive returns (e.g., 2019-2021), there are also periods of extremely negative returns (e.g., 2018-2020, 2021-2023). The beta values fluctuate significantly indicating that the asset's price movement is highly sensitive to overall market movements (especially in 2018-2020 and 2019-2021), though not consistently so. Alpha values show that this asset either underperformed the market significantly or slightly outperformed the market, inconsistently.  This volatility makes it risky.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.286
* **Last Market Data:**  Price: $0.310, Previous Close: $0.350, Change: -11.5% (Indicates a recent price drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.2896
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.3223
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.3829

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent -11.5% drop warrants further investigation into potential contributing factors.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (25.49):**  Suggests the asset is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce-back is possible, but not guaranteed.
* **PPO (-1.02):** A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-1.8):** This confirms a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-250.6%):**  This extremely negative expected return is a significant warning.  It implies a substantial loss compared to S&P 500 over the long term.  The extremely negative expected return combined with the volatility as evidenced in the CAGR, suggests there is significant risk.
* **Last Market Data Impact:** The recent 11.5% drop is a significant event to consider when assessing the current market conditions. It contributes to the overall bearish sentiment.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, XLM-USD demonstrates significant volatility and considerable risk. While the cumulative return has been positive compared to the S&P 500 at this specific point, the negative expected return and highly inconsistent performance over different periods raise serious concerns.  The negative PPO and RSI values suggest bearish sentiment, reinforced by the recent price drop. The extremely negative expected return (-250.6%) is a strong warning signal.  Before investing, further in-depth analysis is necessary to understand the underlying factors driving this volatility and assess whether this risk aligns with your investment strategy.  The extremely high risk should be weighed heavily against potential returns.
