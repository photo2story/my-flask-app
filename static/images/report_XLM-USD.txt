## XLM-USD (Stellar) Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

XLM-USD, Stellar, is a cryptocurrency and decentralized payment network.  The provided data shows significant volatility and outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in certain periods, but also periods of substantial underperformance.  Recent price action suggests potential upward momentum, although indicators remain mixed.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The cumulative return of XLM-USD is 211.097%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 99.228%.  The current price difference is 111.9%, placing it in the 12.6th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500. However, the historical alpha and beta values fluctuate wildly, revealing a highly volatile investment with no consistent relationship to the market (Beta fluctuates significantly).  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) across all periods highlights the substantial risk associated with XLM-USD.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 0.3509
* **Last Market Price:** 0.3543 (Slight increase of 0.96% from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.3306
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.3588
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.3944

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, the recent slight price increase indicates a potential short-term reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (34.15):**  Below 50, indicating potentially oversold conditions.
* **PPO (0.0547):** Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, although the value is quite low.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+1.0):** Indicates recent upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (-174.2%):**  A highly negative expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500. This aligns with the historical volatility and significant drawdowns observed in the provided data.  This suggests that despite periods of significant outperformance, the long-term risk-adjusted return is likely to be substantially lower than the S&P 500.  The sharp price fluctuations indicate a highly speculative asset.


**Conclusion:**

XLM-USD exhibits high volatility and significant periods of both outperformance and underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While recent indicators suggest potential short-term upward movement, the long-term outlook appears significantly riskier than a broad market index like the S&P 500, with a projected negative return relative to the index.  Investment decisions should carefully consider this high risk and volatility.
