The stock price is currently below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.

* **PPO:** -0.47 (negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.5% (short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates no expected excess return over the long term relative to the S&P 500 given the information provided.  This does not imply that the stock will not yield a return, simply that it isn't expected to exceed that of the S&P 500)

The technical indicators are mixed. The RSI is near neutral territory, while the PPO is negative, hinting at a bearish trend. The negative relative divergence change reinforces the short-term bearish sentiment.  Given the 0.0% expected return, the current price may not be signaling an opportunity for exceeding market returns. No significant price jumps (rapid increase or decrease) were observed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the observed period. While revenue remains relatively stable, the negative equity, negative ROE, and volatile EPS raise concerns about the company's financial health. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with short-term bearish trends. The expected return of 0.0% relative to the S&P 500 suggests that exceeding market returns is not likely.  Further investigation is crucial, including analysis of the missing data points (e.g., earnings expectations, recent news, detailed analyst reports), to develop a more comprehensive investment opinion.  The negative equity and ROE are major red flags that need to be thoroughly understood before any investment decisions are made.
