**Analysis:**

However, it's important to consider this within the context of the broader negative trends noted above. The small change in the last market also mean that the price may fluctuate sharply.

*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 49.59
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.27

*   **Expected Return (%):** -890.1%

*   **PPO:**  A PPO of 0.27 suggests that the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, which can be a weak bullish signal.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence reinforces the underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-890.1%) is a HUGE red flag. This suggests the model predicts significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
