## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a global coffeehouse chain operating coffeehouses and roastery reserves throughout the world.

The provided data shows that SBUX has a cumulative return of 48.45%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 116.43%.  Therefore, SBUX underperformed VOO by **-68.0 percentage points** as of the last date in the dataset.  The relative underperformance, considering historical volatility, is at the 18.7th percentile.  This means SBUX's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is relatively worse than in approximately 81.3% of historical periods.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 48% over the 2015-2025 period is noteworthy, although the negative alpha (-68%) indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark. The high beta (107) shows significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements. A Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 39.6% highlights substantial risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.57
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.15

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend, but below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downward trend.  The price is relatively close to the 5 and 20-day moving averages which may suggest consolidation before a new trend begins.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 71.9 – Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, potentially indicating a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.56 – Positive PPO indicates a bullish trend.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.5 – This suggests a short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -61.2% – This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) underperformance relative to the S&P 500. This is a significant negative projection.  The high beta suggests this is influenced by overall market conditions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some variability in EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally remains strong, EPS shows fluctuations.  Further analysis is required to determine the underlying causes of the fluctuations and their long-term implications.  More context (e.g., industry comparisons, macroeconomic factors) is needed for a thorough evaluation.  A single data point of $1 in EPS on 2024-07-30 appears to be duplicated.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | 9.11          |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | 8.56          |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90 | 9.43          |
| 2023-08-01 | 1.00 | 9.17          |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable, although there is some fluctuation. Profit margins have been consistently high, exceeding 25% in recent quarters.

**Capital and Profitability:** Negative equity is a significant concern, indicating potential financial vulnerabilities.  The return on equity (ROE) is also negative, indicating that the company is not generating returns on its shareholder investment.  This requires detailed investigation into the company's balance sheet and capital structure.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX shows strong revenue but negative equity and ROE are major concerns.  While the company has shown a high CAGR, the negative alpha and high beta indicate significant risk and underperformance relative to the market. The current price is near overbought territory (RSI), suggesting potential short-term correction. The long-term outlook (-61.2% expected return relative to the S&P 500) is extremely bearish.  A deep dive into the reasons for negative equity and ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The seemingly strong revenue numbers need to be carefully examined in light of the negative financial health indicators.  Additional qualitative factors, such as competitive landscape and management strategy, would significantly enhance this analysis.
