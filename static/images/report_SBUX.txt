**1) Performance Comparison:**

Starbucks Corp is a global coffeehouse chain.  Over the analyzed period, SBUX significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 74.83% compared to VOO's 118.31%. This represents a difference of -43.5%.  While this seems substantial, the relative divergence of 35.7% suggests this underperformance is not entirely outside the realm of historical variability between the two assets.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results.  While some periods show strong positive alpha (outperformance), others, particularly the most recent years, exhibit negative alpha and increasing beta (higher sensitivity to market movements). The substantial decline in CAGR in recent periods (-16% to -17%) is a major concern.

The price is currently slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating recent downward pressure.  However, it sits above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential support. The recent price change of -$1.40 reflects a small decline from the previous close.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has shown significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in recent years, as evidenced by the negative alpha and substantial return difference.  Technical indicators suggest potential for a near-term price correction.  The negative ROE and negative equity are major red flags that require further analysis. While revenue remains relatively stable, inconsistent earnings and negative financial health metrics raise serious concerns about the long-term outlook for SBUX.  The expected long-term underperformance (-27.5%) further reinforces these concerns.  A deeper dive into the company's financials and strategic initiatives is necessary to fully assess the situation.  The data provided suggests that the investment risk associated with SBUX is currently elevated.
