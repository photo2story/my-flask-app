* **Closing Price:** $106.48
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $110.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $112.15

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (36.24):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (-1.30):**  Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-5.4%):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests bearish sentiment and potential for further downside.  The recent small price increase is not significant enough to overturn this negative outlook.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently underperforming the market, showing negative Alpha and lagging behind the S&P 500 by a significant margin. Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, and the financial data reveals concerns regarding negative equity and ROE. While revenue remains relatively stable, the volatility in earnings and the negative financial health metrics warrant caution.  The negative expected return (-27.3%) further supports this cautious outlook.  A thorough review of the company's financial statements and future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated earnings data requires correction and clarification.
