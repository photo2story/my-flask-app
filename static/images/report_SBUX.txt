The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average points to a considerable decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 28.92 (Suggests oversold conditions, but should be interpreted cautiously in conjunction with other indicators and the long-term negative trend)
* **PPO:** -0.51 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +2.7 (Short-term upward movement, but this is overshadowed by the long-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -73.7% (This extremely negative expected return needs further investigation and context. The methodology used to arrive at this figure should be clarified.)  This suggests significantly underperforming VOO over a 2+ year horizon.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-01-28 | $0.69 | $9.40 B      |

| 2025-01-28 | $0.90 | $9.43 B      |


Earnings appear inconsistent, lacking a clear upward trend.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying reasons for the variability.  The apparent duplication of the 2025-01-28 entry needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|

| 2024-06-30 | $9.11B | 27.91% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.56B | 25.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.43B | 27.51% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE          |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-7.47B  | -10.45%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $-7.45B  | -12.21%      |

| 2023-12-31 | $-8.62B  | -11.89%      |

Negative equity and ROE are extremely concerning. This suggests serious financial issues that require immediate attention and investigation.  The negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating returns on its investment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  While the RSI suggests an oversold condition, the negative alpha, negative equity and ROE, along with the price action all point towards a bearish outlook.  The negative expected return of -73.7% is alarming and requires further scrutiny regarding its calculation and underlying assumptions.  The company's financial health, indicated by negative equity and ROE, is a major cause for concern. Before any investment decision, a thorough investigation into the reasons behind the negative financial performance and the -73.7% expected return is crucial.  Currently, the data suggests a high risk investment.
