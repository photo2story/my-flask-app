Okay, here's an analysis of Starbucks (SBUX) based on the provided data.

## Starbucks (SBUX) Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:** Starbucks Corp. is a global coffeehouse company and roaster of specialty coffees.  SBUX is currently underperforming the S&P 500, with technical indicators suggesting a bearish trend. Recent news is mixed, while analyst opinions lean towards a "Buy" rating. Earnings and revenue are generally positive, but negative equity raises concerns.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **Accumulated Rate Difference:** -88.6%
*   **Relative Deviation:** 7.8
    (This indicates that SBUX's underperformance compared to VOO is at the lower end of its historical range, suggesting it is near its worst comparative performance over the period.)

**Analysis:** SBUX is significantly lagging the S&P 500 in terms of accumulated returns. The large negative deviation suggests substantial underperformance. The relative deviation indicates the underperformance is historically large, but the company does not appear to have a high beta (as shown in the Alpha Beta Analysis), so the underperformance likely stems from company-specific issues.

*   **CAGR:**  Declining CAGR in recent periods.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) across all periods, indicating significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Negative alpha in many periods, especially recently, implying underperformance relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark. Alpha has decreased quite substantially over the past decade, indicating the company is failing to provide excess returns to investors.
*   **Beta:**  Beta has been increasing over the past decade, indicating the company is gradually becoming more volatile as its financial performance declines.
*   **Cap:** The capitalization decreased, potentially signaling decreasing investor confidence.

*   **5-day Moving Average:** 87.024
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 89.4115
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 91.7348

**Analysis:** The current price is below all moving averages, indicating a bearish trend. The 'change' value of -1.47 suggests a recent negative price movement, confirming the short-term downward pressure. The stock also closed well below its previous close, which may be the beginning of a downtrend.

**3. Market Risk Indicator & Other Technicals:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 31.31 (Approaching oversold territory)

*   **Expected Return (%):** -563.1% (Long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests low market risk overall, but this indicator may not apply directly to SBUX.
*   The RSI is nearing oversold levels, which *could* indicate a potential bounce, but this is not a guarantee.
*   The negative PPO reinforces the bearish trend.
*   The hybrid signal recommending a reduction in holdings and increased cash position demonstrates the model's pessimism.
*   The large negative expected return indicates that the model anticipates SBUX to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Starbucks Bear Call Spread Could Net 21% in Two Months (Barchart):** This article suggests a bearish sentiment among some traders, who are betting on limited upside for the stock.
*   **Starbucks’ Pumpkin Spice Latte broke records. Is that enough? (Restaurant Dive):**  While a popular product is performing well, the article questions whether it's enough to address larger challenges the company may be facing.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed, but the bear call spread article confirms some investors are anticipating a downturn. The PSL's success is a positive, but the question of whether it's "enough" suggests underlying concerns about the company's overall performance.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.26)
*   **Target Price:** 99.38 (avg) / 115.00 (high) / 73.00 (low)

**Analysis:** Analyst opinions are generally positive, with a consensus "Buy" rating and an average target price significantly above the current price. However, the wide range in target prices (73.00 to 115.00) indicates uncertainty among analysts.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-07-29 | 0.49 | 9.46 B$    |
| 2025-04-29 | 0.34 | 8.76 B$    |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | 9.40 B$    |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | 9.11 B$    |
| 2025-07-29 | 0.93 | 9.11 B$    |

**Analysis:** EPS and revenue have shown some volatility, but revenue has trended upward recently. It is important to note that the July 29 2025 and July 30 2024 results are the same and likely a typo. The first result for July 29 2025 (EPS: 0.49) should be considered as the true value. Recent quarters show a slightly declining EPS in comparison to prior years.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $9.46B   | 22.80%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $8.76B   | 21.09%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $9.40B   | 24.49%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $9.07B   | 26.25%        |
| 2024-06-30   | $9.11B   | 27.91%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-06-30   | $-7.69B  | -7.26%    |
| 2025-03-31   | $-7.62B  | -5.04%    |
| 2024-12-31   | $-7.47B  | -10.45%   |
| 2024-09-30   | $-7.45B  | -12.21%   |
| 2024-06-30   | $-7.95B  | -13.28%   |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue is generally strong, but profit margins are declining. This could be due to increased costs or pricing pressure.
*   The negative equity and negative ROE are concerning. Negative equity means the company has more liabilities than assets, indicating potential financial distress. The trend of declining ROE suggests the company is becoming less efficient in generating profits from its equity.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX's current situation presents a mixed picture. The company is facing significant headwinds, including underperformance relative to the S&P 500, a bearish technical outlook, and declining profit margins. Recent news highlights both the success of specific products and underlying concerns. The negative equity and ROE are significant warning signs.

While analyst opinions remain positive, the wide range in price targets reflects uncertainty. The hybrid signal suggesting reducing holdings further underscores the need for caution. The most concerning data points are negative equity and poor stock performance relative to VOO.
