## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Starbucks Corp is a global coffeehouse chain operating in various countries.  The cumulative return of SBUX (46.56%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (121.78%) by 75.2 percentage points. This places it at the 13.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a relatively small degree of outperformance compared to the market benchmark. Beta values show significant market correlation, especially the higher values in recent years which suggest higher market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $93.12
* **Last Market Price:** $92.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $96.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $99.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $97.40

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The last market price is very close to the closing price, indicating limited movement in the last trading session.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (20.29):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO (-0.84):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-7.3%):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend.

Given the current price of $92.96, which is below the moving averages and suggests a downtrend, there is no indication of a sudden rebound or crash.  The expected return is 0.0%, meaning no outperformance against the S&P 500 is projected at this time for long-term (2+ years) investing.  However,  the oversold RSI condition suggests a potential for upward movement from the present price.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and Revenue:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates around $9 Billion, with a slight decline in the most recent quarter (2024-09-30).
* **EPS:** EPS shows inconsistency, with peaks in Q1 2024 and Q3 2023 but declining in Q2 2024 and Q4 2023. There is a discrepancy in the reporting of the July 30, 2024 data.  Further clarification is needed for accurate analysis.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable but shows some slight decline in the last quarter. Profit margins are generally high (25-29%), but have shown some volatility over the past year.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative equity values raise concerns. ROE is significantly negative, indicating the company is currently not generating returns on its shareholder equity. This is a major red flag requiring further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news is provided.  Information on market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights is missing. This crucial information is necessary for a complete analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing a negative relative performance.  Technical indicators suggest the stock might be oversold, potentially hinting at a short-term bounce. However, the negative ROE and negative equity, along with volatile EPS and the absence of recent news, present significant concerns.  The lack of positive news and substantial negative financial indicators currently outweigh the oversold technical signal.  Further investigation into the missing information (news, analyst opinions, and clarification on earnings discrepancies) is essential before making any investment decisions.  The current financial health of the company warrants thorough due diligence before any investment commitment.

**8. Recommendation:**

Based solely on the provided, incomplete data, a buy recommendation cannot be made. The negative equity, negative ROE, and inconsistent earnings performance are serious red flags.  Further research into the missing data points (news, analyst opinions, and clarification on earnings reporting inconsistencies) is crucial before considering any investment in SBUX.  A comprehensive analysis involving factors not present in this report is necessary to make an informed investment decision.
