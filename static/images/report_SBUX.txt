*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR is inconsistent, showing periods of strong growth (2017-2020) followed by significant declines (2020-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is consistently high, indicating substantial potential losses during these periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is frequently negative, suggesting the stock has underperformed relative to its benchmark (risk-adjusted basis). This is especially pronounced in recent periods (2020-2025).
*   **Beta:**  Beta fluctuates, indicating varying degrees of correlation with the market.  Positive betas suggest the stock moves in the same direction as the market, while negative betas suggest the opposite.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Market cap grew significantly from 2015 to 2021 but has since declined, reflecting the stock's recent poor performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 89.42
*   **Previous Close:** 85.21
*   **Change:** 4.94
*   **5-day SMA:** 86.09
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.21
*   **60-day SMA:** 84.23
*   **Analysis:** The stock price has seen a noticeable increase in the last trading day, as reflected in the 'change' of 4.94.  The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, indicating a short-term upward trend.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 56.83
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.33
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 3.2 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -962.4
*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment risk. The RSI of 56.83 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions. The PPO is slightly positive, hinting at a slight upward trend in momentum. The 'Hybrid Signal' suggests a "Buy" recommendation based on a separate model, though the high MRI (0.90) within that signal is contradictory to the general MRI, which indicates it's a great time to invest into the stock. The Recent (20 days) relative divergence change signals short-term upward movement. The extremely negative Expected Return is a MAJOR red flag, indicating potential for significant losses if held long-term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Headlines:**
    *   "Starbucks rallies as investors see signs a turnaround is taking hold"
    *   "Starbucks Corp. stock outperforms competitors on strong trading day"
*   **Mixed/Neutral Headlines:**
    *   "How Good Has Starbucks (SBUX) Stock Actually Been?" (implies a look back at past performance, not necessarily current strength)
    *   "Starbucks Stock: Earn $85 Selling Puts at 30% Off" (suggests potential for options trading, not necessarily fundamental strength)
    *   "Starbucks Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend" (generally positive but a standard corporate action)
    *   "Record-setting pay for Seattle CEO may not last" (could be seen as negative depending on interpretation)
*   **Analysis:** The recent news is mixed. Some headlines point to a potential turnaround and outperformance, while others are more retrospective or related to specific financial strategies. The news does indicate increased investor interest and potential positive momentum.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.36)
*   **Target Price:** Average: $94.13, High: $115.00, Low: $67.00
*   **Analysis:** Analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and an average target price slightly above the current price. However, the wide range of target prices indicates some uncertainty among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-07-29 | 0.49  | 9.46 B$   |
| 2025-04-29 | 0.34  | 8.76 B$   |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69  | 9.40 B$   |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93  | 9.11 B$   |
| 2025-07-29 | 0.93  | 9.11 B$   |

*   **Analysis:** Earnings Per Share (EPS) and revenue have fluctuated. More recent EPS figures (0.49, 0.34, 0.69) are lower than the previous data. This inconsistency may concern investors and reflects in the negative long term returns.

**6) Financial Information:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $9.57B | 22.60% |
| 2025-06-30 | $9.46B | 22.80% |
| 2025-03-31 | $8.76B | 21.09% |
| 2024-12-31 | $9.40B | 24.49% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.07B | 26.25% |

*   **Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-09-30 | $-8.10B | -1.65% |
| 2025-06-30 | $-7.69B | -7.26% |
| 2025-03-31 | $-7.62B | -5.04% |
| 2024-12-31 | $-7.47B | -10.45% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-7.45B | -12.21% |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has generally been strong, but the profit margin has declined slightly over the last few quarters.  The negative equity and negative Return on Equity (ROE) are concerning. Negative equity implies liabilities exceed assets, and a negative ROE indicates the company is losing money on its equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

SBUX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. While recent news and analyst opinions suggest a potential turnaround and short-term upward momentum, several concerning factors remain:

*   **Poor Historical Performance:** The Alpha/Beta analysis shows frequent underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Declining Profitability:** Profit margins have decreased slightly, and EPS shows inconsistency.
*   **Negative Equity and ROE:** The most worrying aspects are the negative equity and ROE, indicating financial distress and a potential risk to long-term investment.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** This is a very strong indicator to avoid long-term investment.
*   **Contradictory signals**: While recent rise shows positive upward moment, MRI indicates medium risk, while another indicator shows high risk with low safety.

**Conclusion:**

While there are some positive signs (recent price increase, analyst ratings), the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, declining profitability, and negative equity/ROE raise significant concerns. The extremely negative Expected Return is a strong indication to avoid long-term investment. A more in-depth analysis of the company's financial situation and future plans is needed before making any investment decisions.
