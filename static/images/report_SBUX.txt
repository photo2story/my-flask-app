**6. Summary:**

SBUX is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing a significant negative return difference. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition but also a bearish momentum.  The negative equity and ROE from the financial statements raise serious concerns about the company's financial health. While revenue remains relatively stable, the fluctuating EPS and negative equity warrant further investigation into the underlying business factors. The extremely negative expected return (-81%) needs clarification.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) should carefully consider these financial risks and the company's ability to improve its profitability and equity position.  Before any investment decision, a thorough analysis of the company's financial statements and future prospects is crucial.
