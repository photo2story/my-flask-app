## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Starbucks Corp is a multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), SBUX's cumulative return over the measured period is significantly lower.  The final cumulative return difference is -80.8%, indicating substantial underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  While the relative divergence suggests that this underperformance is within the historical range of variation (9.7% percentile), it still represents a considerable gap.  The provided CAGR data shows mixed performance over different periods, with some years exhibiting strong growth and others experiencing significant decline.  The consistently low alpha suggests limited outperformance relative to market risk.  Beta consistently above 1 signifies higher volatility than the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $87.44
* **Last Market Price:** $89.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $97.00
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $97.22

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The difference between the last market price and closing price ($89.91 vs $87.44) indicates a minor price increase, which is not enough to reverse the established downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 6.95 (Extremely oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.48 (Negative momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.3% (Short-term bearish)

The extremely low RSI and negative PPO values suggest the stock is significantly oversold and experiencing negative momentum.  The negative relative divergence change further reinforces the short-term bearish outlook.  The expected return of 0.0% for long-term (2+ years) investment suggests no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated, considering the current market conditions and historical performance.  A potential sharp rebound from the current prices might occur (as indicated by the slight price difference between the Last-Market price and closing price).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals mixed trends:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates around $9 Billion, showing relative stability but no consistent upward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS shows significant variability, with fluctuations between $0.68 and $1.00. There's no clear upward or downward trend.
* **Quarterly Comparison:** There is no consistent pattern of improvement or decline in either revenue or EPS across the provided quarters.  Direct comparisons between quarters with differing dates (e.g., 2024-07-30 vs 2024-07-30) show inconsistencies.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, however, profit margin shows variability, suggesting challenges in maintaining consistent profitability.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Negative equity across all quarters is a major concern, indicating potential financial weakness.  The negative Return on Equity (ROE) suggests the company is not generating returns on invested capital.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **No recent earnings news (within 2 days) is specified.** To provide a thorough analysis, information on recent earnings calls, press releases, and market news is required.
* **Market Outlook and Analyst Opinions:**  Missing information.  Incorporating current market sentiment and analyst ratings is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
