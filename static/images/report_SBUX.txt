## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Starbucks Corp is a multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington.

The cumulative return of SBUX is 46.79%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) achieved 112.47%.  This represents a significant underperformance of SBUX against the market benchmark by -65.7 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -65.7 places it at the 20.3rd percentile of its historical range (max: 49.4%, min: -95.0%).


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta significantly above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market) and low alpha, suggesting that SBUX hasn't significantly outperformed the market after accounting for its risk. The high beta values across multiple years indicate that SBUX's stock price is more sensitive to market fluctuations than the average stock.  Note that the negative CAGR in recent years is concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $93.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $92.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.23

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend, but a downward trend over the longer term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 69.02 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction).
* **PPO:** 0.47 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.7 (Indicates a recent short-term uptrend).
* **Expected Return:** -54.3% (This is a remarkably negative expectation over the long term relative to the S&P 500. This needs further investigation and context).  This suggests a significant underperformance is projected versus the S&P 500 over a two-year timeframe.

The current price of $93.51 doesn't indicate a dramatic recent spike (no evidence of a sharp upward or downward move based on provided moving averages).

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity       | ROE           |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $-7.45 Billion | -12.21%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $-7.95 Billion | -13.28%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $-8.45 Billion | -9.14%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $-8.62 Billion | -11.89%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $-7.99 Billion | -15.25%       |

Negative equity is a significant concern.  The negative ROE across all periods indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity investment. This warrants further investigation into the company's balance sheet and financial health.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly. While the recent short-term price action suggests some bullish momentum (based on moving averages and PPO), the negative expected return, negative ROE, and the high beta indicate substantial risk. The negative equity is a serious red flag.  Before investing, a thorough investigation into the causes of the negative ROE and negative equity is crucial.  The inconsistent financial performance warrants caution.  The remarkably negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 strongly suggests that SBUX is not a favorable investment at this time unless there's a significant turnaround in its fundamentals.  Further research into the duplicated earnings data and overall financial health is essential before making any investment decisions.
