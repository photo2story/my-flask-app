## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Starbucks Corp is a multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves.  This report analyzes SBUX's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), evaluating key financial indicators, and offering a concluding assessment.  Key findings reveal significant underperformance relative to the market, along with concerning negative equity and ROE.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SBUX's cumulative return (10.93%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return (65.78%), resulting in a considerable negative divergence (-54.8%).  This places SBUX at the 34.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance. While periods of positive alpha (outperformance) exist (2017-2021), recent years have shown substantial negative CAGR and increasing Beta, indicating heightened market sensitivity and underperformance. The high negative alpha in recent years also suggest a significantly lower than market return.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) generally increased until 2021, then decreased.

SBUX's closing price is $84.60.  The stock has experienced a recent decline, trading below its 5-day ($83.01), 20-day ($93.81), and 60-day ($102.50) moving averages.  This suggests a bearish trend.  The significant drop from the previous close (-4.6) points to a recent sharp decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk).
* **RSI:** 34.44 (suggests oversold conditions, but needs further context).
* **PPO:** -1.21 (negative value indicates bearish momentum).
* **Relative Strength:**  The recent 20-day relative strength divergence of -0.9 confirms a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** A projected -80.5% expected return indicates severe underperformance compared to expectations, possibly due to various factors including economic climate or company-specific issues.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not provided, but the current trend shows significant underperformance that would need reversal before a positive outlook would be plausible.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings show some volatility. While revenue generally stays above $9B, EPS fluctuates. Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying drivers of this volatility.  Note that the data contains duplicate entries for 2025-01-28.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | $9.40B        |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | $9.11B        |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | $8.56B        |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90 | $9.43B        |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.90 | $9.43B        |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, but profitability (profit margin) shows some fluctuation. However, the capital and profitability metrics are deeply concerning.  Negative equity and a consistently negative ROE across all listed quarters indicate severe financial distress, which could further explain the low stock price.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $9.40B  | 24.49%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $9.07B  | 26.25%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $9.11B  | 27.91%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $8.56B  | 25.58%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $9.43B  | 27.51%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE       |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31  | $-7.47B | -10.45%   |
| 2024-09-30  | $-7.45B | -12.21%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $-7.95B | -13.28%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $-8.45B | -9.14%    |
| 2023-12-31  | $-8.62B | -11.89%   |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SBUX shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, characterized by negative CAGR, high negative Alpha, and increasing Beta in recent years.  Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum and oversold conditions. Most critically, the negative equity and ROE raise significant concerns about the financial health of the company.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for these financial issues is crucial before considering any investment.  The provided -80.5% expected return strongly suggests against investment at this time.  More detailed fundamental analysis, including an assessment of the competitive landscape and management's strategic response to current challenges, is necessary to make an informed investment decision.
