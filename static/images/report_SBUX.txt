SBUX has shown periods of strong performance but currently underperforms the S&P 500.  Recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, with the significant price drop needing further context.  While revenue remains strong, negative equity and ROE raise serious concerns requiring further investigation into the company's financial health. The negative expected return, coupled with the volatile earnings and negative equity, suggests caution before investing.  A thorough analysis of the company's financial statements and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data alone is insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation.
