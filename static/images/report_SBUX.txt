## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** SBUX
* **Company:** Starbucks Corp, a global coffeehouse chain.
* **Cumulative Return (SBUX):** 12.61%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 66.94%
* **Return Difference (SBUX vs VOO):** -54.3%
* **Relative Divergence:** 34.6% (Indicates SBUX's performance is relatively lower compared to the S&P 500,  but not at the extreme low end of its historical range.)


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Starbucks' cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The -54.3% difference indicates a substantial lag.  The relative divergence of 34.6% places this underperformance in the lower range of its historical variability relative to the S&P 500.

The alpha/beta analysis shows a fluctuating beta, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements.  The negative alpha values in earlier years indicate underperformance relative to the market, while positive alphas in later years show periods of outperformance, although  the recent years (2022-2025) show consistently high, increasing alpha levels and negative CAGR. This high alpha alongside negative CAGR  is worth further investigation and potentially suggests the market may be undervaluing SBUX relative to its risk.  The shrinking market capitalization (Cap(B)) despite relative outperformance (alpha) warrants closer examination.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -2.0% | 58.2% | -31.0% | -0.0 | 55.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 0.0% | 59.2% | -17.0% | -0.0 | 64.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 50.0% | 59.2% | 21.0% | 1.0 | 89.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 57.0% | 61.7% | 32.0% | 1.6 | 110.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 47.0% | 61.7% | -7.0% | 1.8 | 123.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -29.0% | 66.9% | -35.0% | 2.2 | 107.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -31.0% | 68.1% | -47.0% | 3.3 | 105.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -33.0% | 68.1% | -50.0% | 3.8 | 103.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $88.68
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $83.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $94.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $102.62

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent significant price change ($11.28 increase) needs to be considered in context.  While a large positive change, it is crucial to monitor for continuation or reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.53 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.13 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** -1.39 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.3% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -79.4% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further investigation and context.  The basis for this calculation should be clarified).  The large positive price change in the `Last-market` data needs to be reconciled with this long-term negative expectation.

The combination of high MRI, low RSI, and negative PPO suggests a potentially bearish outlook, although the low RSI hints at potential buying opportunities. The -79.4% expected return raises serious concerns and requires detailed explanation of its derivation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | $9.40 B     |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | $9.11 B     |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | $8.56 B     |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90 | $9.43 B     |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.90 | $9.43 B     |

There's a noticeable fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes of this variability and to project future earnings. A simple average or trend analysis is insufficient; a deeper dive into macroeconomic factors and company-specific news is required.  The apparent duplication of the 2025-01-28 data point should be clarified.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.40B | 24.49% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.07B | 26.25% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.11B | 27.91% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.56B | 25.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.43B | 27.51% |

Revenue remains relatively stable, though profit margins show some fluctuation.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $-7.47B | -10.45% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-7.45B | -12.21% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-7.95B | -13.28% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-8.45B | -9.14% |
| 2023-12-31 | $-8.62B | -11.89% |

Negative equity and ROE are extremely concerning and require a thorough investigation.  This indicates a significant financial challenge for the company.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Starbucks' performance has lagged the S&P 500 considerably.  While there have been periods of outperformance (as indicated by positive alpha), the recent trend is negative. Negative equity and ROE raise significant red flags about the company's financial health.  The highly negative long-term expected return (-79.4%) needs urgent clarification and further analysis to determine its validity. Technical indicators point to a bearish short-term outlook, although the RSI suggests the stock might be oversold.   Before making any investment decisions, a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the negative equity, ROE, and the -79.4% expected return is crucial.  Further investigation into macroeconomic factors impacting the coffee industry and Starbucks' specific business challenges is necessary for a complete and accurate assessment.
