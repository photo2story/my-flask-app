## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

Starbucks Corp is a global coffeehouse chain.  The provided data reveals SBUX has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly over the analyzed period, showing negative alpha and high beta. While recent earnings show relatively stable revenue, profitability metrics and financial health require further investigation due to negative equity and ROE. Short-term price movements indicate a bearish trend, although the RSI suggests it's not oversold.  Long-term investment potential is questionable given the current data.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SBUX's cumulative return (39.87%) is significantly lower than the S&P 500's (89.83%).  The provided  divergence (-50.0, 31.9% relative divergence) highlights SBUX's underperformance compared to the market.  The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance over the years. While some periods show positive alpha (outperforming the market), recent years exhibit negative CAGR and increasingly high Beta (meaning higher market volatility impact). Negative ROE and negative equity in recent quarters are extremely concerning and should be investigated further.

* **20-day Moving Average:** $100.32
* **60-day Moving Average:** $103.11

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The slight negative change (-$0.02) from the previous close is not significant.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.5 (Slightly below neutral; not oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.07 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +2.7 (Short-term upward trend, but weak)
* **Expected Return:** -57.6% (This is a very large negative expected return and needs further clarification on the calculation method. This extremely negative value strongly suggests a need for caution).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | $9.40B      |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | $9.11B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | $8.56B      |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90 | $9.43B      |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.90 | $9.43B      |

Revenue shows some volatility but remains relatively stable around $9B. EPS fluctuates, indicating inconsistent profitability.  There's a discrepancy in the data â€“ the 2025-01-28 data is duplicated. This requires clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.40B | 24.49% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.07B | 26.25% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.11B | 27.91% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.56B | 25.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.43B | 27.51% |

Profit margins are relatively healthy but fluctuate.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE       |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-7.47B | -10.45%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $-7.45B | -12.21%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $-7.95B | -13.28%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $-8.45B | -9.14%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $-8.62B | -11.89%  |


**Negative equity is a major red flag**, indicating a serious financial issue that needs immediate attention and further investigation. Negative ROE across all quarters further reinforces this concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While revenue remains relatively stable, the negative equity and ROE, combined with a high beta and negative alpha, present significant risk. The short-term price trend is bearish. The extremely negative expected return (-57.6%) requires careful scrutiny and clarification on its methodology. Before considering any long-term investment, a thorough investigation into the causes of the negative equity and ROE is crucial.  The current data suggests a high-risk investment with limited upside potential based on the provided information.  Additional fundamental analysis and financial statement review are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
