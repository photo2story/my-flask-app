## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Performance Review

**0. Overview:**

Starbucks Corp is a global coffeehouse chain operating in various countries.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

SBUX's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows:

* **SBUX Cumulative Return:** 69.03%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 119.91%
* **Return Difference:** -50.9%
* **Relative Divergence:** 30.5% (This means that the current underperformance of SBUX relative to VOO is at the 30.5th percentile of the historical range of divergence between the two.)


The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals varying performance relative to the market (VOO) over different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), recent years (2021-2025) show negative alpha and high beta (higher sensitivity to market movements).  The significantly negative alpha in recent years and the substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 suggest underperformance of SBUX in relation to the market as a whole. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows growth over the analyzed period, yet this is not reflected by substantial gains relative to the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $107.68
* **Last Market Price:** $108.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $105.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $97.15
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.89

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The small increase from the previous close ($0.33) indicates a modest daily gain.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 89.67 (Overbought territory; suggesting potential for price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.66 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but high RSI suggests caution)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +11.2% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -32.8% (This implies a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term based on the current data.  The negative expected return implies that the investment would likely underperform the S&P 500.)


The high RSI value along with the significant positive change in the short-term relative divergence indicate that the current price might be overvalued.
