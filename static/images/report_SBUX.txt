## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Analysis

**0. Overview:**

Starbucks Corp is a global coffeehouse chain known for its specialty coffee, tea, and other beverages.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

SBUX's cumulative return (19.38%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 76.18%.  The difference is -56.8%, placing it at the 35.5th percentile of historical divergence relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of -111.3% to 42.1%).  This indicates SBUX has underperformed the market considerably over the measured period.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows mixed results, with periods of significant outperformance (positive alpha) followed by considerable underperformance (negative alpha in recent years). The beta consistently above 1 suggests higher volatility than the overall market.  The declining market capitalization (Cap(B)) from 2019 onwards reflects this trend.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $81.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $83.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $89.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $101.51

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price change of $0.92 (from $80.76) shows a slight positive movement, but it's still within a bearish context given the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 30.12 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.5675 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.4 (Positive, but needs further context to confirm if significant)
* **Expected Return:** -80.8% (This is a very negative forecast.  Reasons for such a drastic negative prediction require clarification and further analysis to validate.  The context of this value needs explanation, such as whether itâ€™s based on a specific model or forecasting methodology).  This negative expected return, relative to the S&P 500, further emphasizes the underperformance of SBUX.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally stays above $9 billion, EPS fluctuates considerably. There's no clear upward or downward trend discernible from this limited data.  More historical data is needed for a more comprehensive analysis.

| Date        | EPS  | Revenue      |
|-------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-01-28  | 0.69 | $9.40B       |
| 2024-07-30  | 0.93 | $9.11B       |
| 2024-04-30  | 0.68 | $8.56B       |
| 2024-01-30  | 0.90 | $9.43B       |
| 2025-01-28  | 0.90 | $9.43B (Duplicate Entry?) |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals concerning trends. While revenue remains relatively strong, profitability (profit margin) shows fluctuations. The negative equity and ROE figures across all quarters are extremely worrisome and indicate serious financial issues that need thorough investigation. This is a significant red flag.

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE       |
|-------------|----------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31  | $9.40B   | 24.49%        | $-7.47B   | -10.45%   |
| 2024-09-30  | $9.07B   | 26.25%        | $-7.45B   | -12.21%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $9.11B   | 27.91%        | $-7.95B   | -13.28%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $8.56B   | 25.58%        | $-8.45B   | -9.14%    |
| 2023-12-31  | $9.43B   | 27.51%        | $-8.62B   | -11.89%   |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently exhibiting signs of significant underperformance relative to the broader market. The negative expected return, low RSI, and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum.  However, the over-sold RSI could indicate a potential short-term bounce.  The extremely concerning negative equity and ROE values highlight serious fundamental issues that need further investigation before any investment decision is made. The provided data suggests a high-risk investment scenario with a potential for further decline in the near term.  Long-term investment decisions should only be made after a thorough due diligence process including examination of the causes for the negative equity and ROE figures and the justification for the -80.8% expected return.
