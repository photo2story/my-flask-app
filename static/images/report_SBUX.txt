The provided data shows SBUX significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, exhibiting negative alpha and a relatively low RSI. Recent earnings show mixed results, and financial health indicators suggest concerns regarding equity and ROE.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Starbucks (SBUX) accumulated a return of 11.29%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) yielded 66.69%. This results in a significant underperformance of -55.4%.  The relative divergence of -33.9% places SBUX in the lower range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -2.0% | 58.2% | -0.0 | 55.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 0.0% | 59.2% | -0.0 | 64.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 50.0% | 59.2% | 1.0 | 89.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 57.0% | 61.7% | 1.6 | 110.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 47.0% | 61.7% | 1.8 | 123.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -29.0% | 66.9% | 2.2 | 107.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -31.0% | 68.1% | 3.3 | 105.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -33.0% | 68.1% | 3.8 | 103.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $85.49
* 5-Day Moving Average: $84.78
* 20-Day Moving Average: $92.50
* 60-Day Moving Average: $102.23

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent small positive change ($0.07) doesn't signify a significant reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk category)
* **RSI:** 36.83 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.68 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -1.4 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -82.3% (This indicates a significant expected loss against the S&P 500 over the long term â€“ 2+ years.)  This is a very bearish forecast and requires further investigation and consideration of the methodology used to derive this return.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows inconsistent performance. While revenue generally remains above $9B, EPS fluctuates significantly, suggesting potential challenges in profitability and consistency.  There is also a duplicate entry for 2025-01-28 in the table which makes analysis of the data difficult.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | $9.40B      |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | $9.11B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | $8.56B      |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90 | $9.43B      |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.90 | $9.43B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows relatively consistent performance around the $9B mark. Profit margins are healthy, generally above 25%.  However, the Capital and Profitability section reveals serious concerns.  Negative equity and a negative Return on Equity (ROE) across all quarters indicate significant financial distress.  This needs urgent attention and further investigation.

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE        |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $9.40B      | 24.49%        | $-7.47B   | -10.45%    |
| 2024-09-30  | $9.07B      | 26.25%        | $-7.45B   | -12.21%    |
| 2024-06-30  | $9.11B      | 27.91%        | $-7.95B   | -13.28%    |
| 2024-03-31  | $8.56B      | 25.58%        | $-8.45B   | -9.14%     |
| 2023-12-31  | $9.43B      | 27.51%        | $-8.62B   | -11.89%    |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500, displaying negative alpha and high volatility. While some quarters show positive profit margins and strong revenue, the negative equity and ROE are extremely concerning. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the negative PPO and substantial negative expected return signal continued downward pressure.  The underlying financial health of the company needs to be urgently addressed. Before considering any investment,  a thorough investigation into the reasons behind the negative equity and ROE is crucial. The -82.3% expected return prediction is exceptionally bearish and should be viewed with extreme skepticism until validated by a deeper fundamental analysis.
