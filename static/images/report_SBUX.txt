## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a global coffeehouse chain.  Over the period reviewed, SBUX's cumulative return (53.82%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (122.83%). The difference is a substantial -69.0%, placing it in the 18th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting that the stock's returns have slightly outperformed its benchmark, although this is relatively small given the significant underperformance in cumulative returns.  The high Beta of 111 indicates high volatility relative to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $97.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $96.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $93.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.20

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend, although the recent price change is relatively small.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 84.11 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction might be imminent.
* **PPO:** 0.95 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.0 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -65.4% – This indicates a significant expected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This prediction strongly contrasts with the short term bullish momentum suggested by moving averages and PPO. The small price increase indicated by *Last-market* does not appear to significantly impact this long-term outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue. While revenue generally remains above $9B, EPS fluctuates between $0.68 and $1.  There is a duplicated entry for July 30, 2024, which needs clarification.  A more detailed analysis requires consistent and accurate data.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, fluctuating around $9B. Profit margins are generally strong, ranging from 25% to 29%, but have shown some recent decline.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative equity is a significant concern. A negative Return on Equity (ROE) across all quarters indicates the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital.  This should be investigated further to understand the underlying causes.


**7. Overall Summary:**

Starbucks currently presents a mixed picture. While the company shows relatively stable revenue and historically strong profit margins, its stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Technical indicators show overbought conditions and positive momentum, but the long-term expected return is deeply negative. The negative equity and ROE are major red flags, suggesting fundamental issues that need further investigation.  The apparent discrepancy between short-term technical signals and the long-term expected return requires careful consideration. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. The inconsistent earnings data and need for clarification of the duplicated entry further highlight the need for more robust analysis before drawing definitive conclusions.
