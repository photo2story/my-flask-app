*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue:** Revenue has remained relatively consistent over the past five quarters, indicating stable sales performance.
    *   **Profit Margin:** The profit margin has shown a decreasing trend, declining from 27.91% in Q2 2024 to 22.80% in Q2 2025. This indicates a potential challenge in maintaining profitability, possibly due to increased costs or pricing pressures.
    *   **Equity:** The equity is consistently negative, which is a major concern. This indicates that the company's liabilities exceed its assets.
    *   **ROE:** The negative ROE values reflect the negative equity and indicate that the company is not generating profits from shareholder investments. The recent ROE values, although still negative, have improved slightly, which may be a positive sign but not enough to offset the underlying issues.

**7. 종합 결론 (Overall Conclusion)**

Based on the analysis of the provided data, Starbucks (SBUX) is currently facing significant challenges:

*   **Underperformance:** The stock is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, with a large negative deviation and a very negative expected return.
*   **Downtrend:** Technical indicators (moving averages, PPO, RSI) suggest a recent downtrend in the stock price.
*   **Sell Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends a strong sell position, suggesting a reduction in holdings.
*   **Financial Concerns:** Declining profit margins, negative equity, and negative ROE values raise serious concerns about the company's financial health.
*   **Earnings:** EPS decline amid stable revenue suggests profitability concerns.
*   **News:** Recent news highlights both risks and opportunities but reinforces the potential for volatility.

**Recommendation:**  Given the strong sell signal, poor financial health, and underperformance relative to the S&P 500, a cautious approach is warranted. While the MRI indicates low market risk, the specific issues facing Starbucks outweigh this positive indicator.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative equity, declining profit margins, and the specific "major business developments" mentioned in the news is crucial before considering any long-term investment.
