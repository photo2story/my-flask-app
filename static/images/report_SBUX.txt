**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.81
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $81.5
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $100.68

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price change of $1.3 is positive showing a potential upward turn but not sufficient to suggest a significant change in trend considering the overall picture.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 30.29 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.0624 (Bearish signal)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -86.3% (This extremely negative figure requires further investigation and context. It is likely an outlier or calculation error and should not be taken at face value without further examination of the methodology used. It needs more information about the calculation process).

The indicators point to a bearish market sentiment, with the RSI suggesting oversold conditions, but the substantial negative expected return warrants skepticism and calls for deeper scrutiny of this data point.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69  | $9.40 B       |

| 2025-01-28 | 0.90  | $9.43 B       |


There's some inconsistency in the data (duplicated 2025-01-28 entry),  requiring clarification.  Revenue appears relatively stable but EPS fluctuates, indicating potential challenges in profitability and efficiency.

Negative equity and ROE are concerning and suggest significant financial challenges.  This needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SBUX's recent performance shows significant underperformance against the S&P 500, with considerable volatility. While some technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce, the negative expected return (requiring further validation), negative equity, and fluctuating profitability raise significant concerns.
