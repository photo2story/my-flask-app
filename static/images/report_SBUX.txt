## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Starbucks Corp is a global coffeehouse chain.  SBUX's recent performance significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting negative momentum across various indicators.  While recent earnings show relatively stable revenue, profitability metrics and financial health require further investigation due to negative equity and ROE.  The stock's low RSI and negative PPO suggest it's oversold, but significant underperformance warrants caution.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

SBUX accumulated a return of 4.36%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) returned 56.68%. This represents a significant divergence of -52.3%, placing SBUX at the 36th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently high Beta values (indicating high market sensitivity), while Alpha fluctuates, reflecting periods of outperformance and underperformance against the market.  The negative CAGR in recent years is particularly concerning.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $81.69
* **Last Market:** $81.97 (+$2.46 change from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $89.94
* **20-day Moving Average:** $95.96
* **60-day Moving Average:** $102.92

The stock price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price increase is a small positive signal, but given the larger context, this could be a temporary bounce.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 20.59 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.57 (Negative momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.2% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -74.4% (This suggests a high risk of significant further losses.  This data should be carefully analyzed and treated with caution).

The combination of high MRI, low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests a bearish trend. The significantly negative expected return reinforces the high-risk profile. The recent price increase of $2.46 might be considered a brief bounce in an otherwise negative trend.

| 2023-12-31 | $-8.62B   | -11.89%     |

**Negative equity and ROE are extremely alarming and indicate significant financial distress.**  This needs immediate and thorough investigation.  The profitability metrics from the revenue analysis should be viewed in light of this negative capital and profitability situation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently exhibiting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While revenue remains relatively stable, the negative equity and ROE are serious red flags indicating potential financial problems.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the severity of the underperformance and negative financial metrics outweigh this.  A long-term investment strategy, while potentially appealing from a valuation perspective given the low price,  must consider the substantial risk related to the company's financial health.  Further research into the causes of negative equity and ROE is crucial before any investment decision is made.  The -74.4% expected return is a particularly strong warning against further investment without understanding and addressing these significant issues.
