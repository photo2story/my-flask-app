**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further data is needed for a more complete picture.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period. While recent price action suggests short-term upward momentum, overbought RSI levels and a negative long-term expected return (relative to the S&P 500) raise concerns. The lack of comprehensive financial data hampers a thorough assessment.  Further investigation into the reasons for underperformance, including a more detailed analysis of the company's financial statements and industry trends, is crucial before forming any investment conclusion.  The provided alpha and beta analysis show high market sensitivity and inconsistent performance relative to the market.  Caution is advised given the limited data and conflicting signals.
