**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing a considerable gap in cumulative returns.

This includes reviewing complete financial statements, analyzing analyst reports, and considering any recent news or market events impacting the company.  The negative equity and ROE are major red flags and need to be thoroughly investigated before making any investment decision.
