**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, exhibiting a negative alpha and a high beta. While recent price movements show a slight upward trend, the technical indicators and long-term expected return suggest a bearish outlook. The company’s financial statements reveal concerns about negative equity and decreasing profit margins, despite relatively stable revenue.  Long-term investors should carefully consider these factors before investing in SBUX, especially given the large negative expected return against the S&P 500. Further investigation into the causes of the negative equity and the duplicated earnings data is necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.
