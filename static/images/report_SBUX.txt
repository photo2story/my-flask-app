* **20-Day Moving Average:** $100.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $97.30

The stock price is currently slightly below its short-term moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The 60-day MA being further below the 20-day and 5-day averages emphasizes a more recent period of weakening stock value.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** -0.30 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -2.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates the model predicts no outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  It's crucial to remember that this is just a prediction, and actual performance can vary).

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum. The negative change in relative strength reinforces this view.

The closing price is near the moving averages; there isn't evidence of a significant sudden upward or downward movement.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, with a high of $9.43B in Q1 2024 and a low of $8.56B in Q2 2024.  No clear consistent upward or downward trend is evident from this limited data.
* **EPS:** EPS also fluctuates, ranging from $0.68 to $1.00 across the reported quarters. There is no clear trend that can be derived from this limited data.  It is important to note that there's a duplicate entry for 2024-07-30. This inconsistency needs clarification.
