## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington.

The cumulative return of SBUX is 70.45%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 119.94%.  Therefore, SBUX underperformed VOO by **49.49%** as of the last day in the provided data. The relative divergence of -49.5% indicates that SBUX's performance is significantly below the S&P 500, placing it in the lower percentile of its historical performance relative to the index.  The Alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting a small degree of outperformance compared to the market.  However, the Beta, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0, implies a moderate to high sensitivity to overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $108.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $101.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $95.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.54

The recent price of $108.58 is significantly above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent price surge. The price increased by 8.14% compared to the previous closing price, indicating a rapid upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 93.01 – This extremely high RSI value indicates the stock is significantly overbought and suggests a potential pullback is likely.
* **PPO:** 1.49 – A positive PPO suggests upward momentum, but the high RSI suggests this momentum might be unsustainable.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +12.9% – This confirms the recent sharp upward movement.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -31.0% – This suggests a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.

Given the significant price increase ('change' value in the Last-market dictionary) and the exceptionally high RSI, a period of consolidation or correction is highly probable.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |

Earnings are inconsistent, showing fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  There's a need for more data to properly assess trends and seasonality in earnings performance.  The apparent duplication of the 2023-10-31 and 2025-01-28 data points requires clarification.

Negative equity and ROE are significant concerns, indicating potential financial instability and requiring further investigation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX shows a recent price surge, driven by short-term positive momentum. However, this is countered by several negative indicators: significantly underperformance against the S&P 500, an extremely overbought RSI, a negative long-term expected return relative to the market, and alarmingly negative equity and ROE figures. The inconsistency in earnings data and the need for clarification on duplicate data points further weaken confidence. While revenue and profit margins appear reasonably healthy, the negative equity and ROE raise serious questions about the company's long-term financial health and sustainability.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in SBUX, given the current indicators of potential overvaluation and fundamental weaknesses.  The recent price surge might be a short-lived event, and a correction is likely.
