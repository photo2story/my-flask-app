*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values consistently above 60% indicate substantial volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are predominantly negative, suggesting underperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the market).  Positive Alpha during the 2017-2020 period indicates outperformance during those years.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values fluctuate. A Beta around 1 suggests market correlation, while values above 1 suggest higher volatility than the market and values below 1 suggest lower volatility than the market.  Negative Betas indicate inverse correlation.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market Capitalization (in Billions) shows an increase up to 2021, followed by a decline, suggesting a peak in investor confidence around that time.

*   **Previous Close:** 89.42
*   **Change:** -1.22
*   **5-day SMA:** 86.688
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.4917
*   **60-day SMA:** 84.3051

**Analysis:** The stock price closed lower than the previous day, with a negative change of -1.22. All three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are below the current price, indicating a possible short-term upward trend. The fact that the 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs further supports this short-term upward momentum.

**3. RSI, PPO, Market Risk Indicator, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment).
*   **RSI:** 60.62 (Suggests slightly overbought conditions).
*   **PPO:** 0.43 (Positive, indicating a slightly bullish trend).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01) - A strong buy signal with no cash allocation, suggesting a very optimistic outlook based on the MRI of 0.90.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase).
*   **Expected Return (%):** -671.0 (A very large negative number suggests a severely pessimistic long-term outlook compared to the S&P 500).

**Analysis:** While the RSI suggests a slightly overbought condition and the PPO signals a small bullish trend, the extremely negative expected return raises serious concerns about long-term investment prospects. The recent short-term increase in relative divergence provides a glimmer of hope, but the overall picture is worrisome.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

The news headlines suggest a mixed sentiment:

*   **Positive:** Multiple articles mention a potential turnaround, signs of improvement, analyst forecasts, and investors seeing positive signals.
*   **Neutral/Slightly Negative:** One article notes a decrease in stock position by Cascade Investment Advisors Inc. Another mentions a foray into beauty and fashion, which might be seen as a distraction from the core business.
*   **Overall:** The news leans towards optimism about a potential turnaround, but it's important to note the dissenting opinions.

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean of 2.36)
*   **Target Price:** $94.13 (Average), $115.00 (High), $67.00 (Low)

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and an average target price above the current price.

The lack of recent rating changes information makes it difficult to assess current shifts in sentiment.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Performance:** SBUX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Its Alpha and Beta history is volatile and shows periods of both outperformance and underperformance.
*   **Price Action:** Recent price movement suggests a possible short-term upward trend, but the overall trend is not clearly defined.
*   **Technical Indicators:**  RSI indicates slightly overbought, PPO indicates a slightly bullish trend. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a "Medium Investment" risk level, but it is worth noting the MRI can be subject to change.
*   **News:** Recent news articles indicate a potential turnaround, but caution is warranted.
*   **Analyst Opinion:**  Analysts have a generally positive outlook.
*   **Earnings:**  Earnings per share (EPS) fluctuated, and revenue are generally high.
*   **Financial Health:** The negative equity and ROE, combined with declining profit margins, are major concerns.
*   **Overall Recommendation:** Based on this data, a cautious approach to investing in SBUX is recommended. While there are signs of a potential turnaround and positive analyst sentiment, the company's financial health (negative equity and negative ROE) raises significant red flags. The extremely negative expected return should also be carefully considered. A more in-depth investigation is warranted to assess the sustainability of any potential turnaround. The large divergence between the SBUX and VOO returns over the given timeframe is concerning, and the very pessimistic long-term outlook should not be ignored.
