**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX shows mixed signals. While revenue is relatively stable and profit margins are generally healthy, the negative equity and ROE raise serious concerns.

The RSI nearing overbought territory also indicates potential short-term price corrections.

The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry) also need clarification before drawing conclusive statements.
