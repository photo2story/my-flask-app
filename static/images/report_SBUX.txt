| 2023-2025  | -9.0%  | 81.9% | -74.0%  | 0.8    | 96.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR is highly variable, with periods of strong growth (2017-2020) followed by significant declines (2020-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently high, indicating substantial potential for loss.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is primarily negative, suggesting SBUX has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis for most periods shown.  The 2017-2020 period shows positive alpha, but recent years are deeply negative.
*   **Beta:** The Beta fluctuates, indicating varying degrees of correlation with the market. In recent periods, Beta is negative, implying an inverse relationship with the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap in Billions):** Market capitalization increased significantly over the period but has declined in recent years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 84.96
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 84.87, Previous Close: 84.91, Change: -0.05
*   **5-day SMA:** 85.60
*   **20-day SMA:** 84.48
*   **60-day SMA:** 83.90

**Analysis:**

The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA, but above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a short-term downward trend but still some support from longer-term moving averages. The small change in the last market data indicates relatively stable trading in the most recent session.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.98
*   **PPO:** 0.21
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.6 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -890.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite other negative indicators, the MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended." This is extremely suspect, given the poor performance and other indicators. It should be regarded with extreme caution.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 50.98 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO suggests a small upward trend in momentum, but it's not strong.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is contradictory to the Expected Return, advocating a 100% cash investment into the stock.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term decline compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The drastically negative expected return is extremely concerning and suggests a very pessimistic outlook for SBUX.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Several headlines suggest negative sentiment surrounding Starbucks. These include concerns about valuation ("Over-Caffeinated Valuation"), labor issues ("Starbucks Stock Slips as Mamdani, Sanders Join Picket Lines", "$38.9 Million Labor Settlement"), and institutional selling ("VestGen Advisors LLC Sells Shares").
*   **China:** One article mentions Jim Cramer being glad he doesn't have to worry about China, which could imply previous concerns about Starbucks' exposure to the Chinese market.
*   **2026 Forecast:** One article refers to Wall Street's 2026 forecast, which could be a source of concern if the forecast is unfavorable.

**Analysis:**

The recent news flow is predominantly negative, focusing on valuation concerns, labor disputes, and institutional selling. This negative press is likely contributing to the stock's underperformance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.36)
*   **Target Price:** 94.00 (Avg) / 115.00 (High) / 67.00 (Low)

**Analysis:**

Despite the negative news and poor performance, the analyst consensus remains a "Buy." This is somewhat contradictory to the other indicators. The target price range is wide, reflecting uncertainty about the stock's future. The average target price of $94 suggests a potential upside, but the low target price of $67 indicates significant downside risk.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출     |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-07-29 | 0.49 | 9.46 B$  |
| 2025-04-29 | 0.34 | 8.76 B$  |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | 9.40 B$  |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | 9.11 B$  |
| 2025-07-29 | 0.93 | 9.11 B$  |

**Analysis:**

This table appears to have a duplicated row, so I'll analyze based on the unique entries. The recent EPS has been declining from 0.93 in 2024 to 0.49 and 0.34 in 2025, before slightly rebounding to 0.69 and 0.93 (duplicated). Revenue is fluctuating in the 8.76B to 9.46B range. The declining EPS trend is a cause for concern, even if revenues are relatively stable.

| 2024-12-31 | $-7.47B  | -10.45%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $-7.45B  | -12.21%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but is generally stable in the $8.7B - $9.6B range.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have declined from a high of 26.25% to around 22.60-22.80%.  This is a negative trend.
*   **Equity:** The company has negative equity, which is a significant red flag. This indicates that liabilities exceed assets.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is negative, further highlighting the company's financial struggles. The negative ROE and negative equity are highly concerning and suggest significant financial risk.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Starbucks (SBUX) is currently facing several challenges:

*   **Significant Underperformance:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Negative News:** Recent news is largely negative, focusing on labor issues, valuation concerns, and institutional selling.
*   **Declining Profitability:** Profit margins are decreasing.
*   **Negative Equity & ROE:** The company has negative equity and negative ROE, indicating significant financial strain.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** While analysts have a "Buy" consensus, the expected return is drastically negative, and other technical indicators are not strongly positive. The MRI is also questionable, recommending a High Investment despite the overall bearish trends.
*   **Declining EPS:** The EPS is declining from 2024 to 2025.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, investing in SBUX at this time appears very risky. The negative news, poor financial performance, and drastically negative expected return outweigh the positive analyst consensus and the questionable "High Investment Recommended" MRI. The negative equity and ROE are particularly concerning. Further research is strongly recommended before considering an investment. The Hybrid signal recommendation should be disregarded due to contradictory facts about the company.
