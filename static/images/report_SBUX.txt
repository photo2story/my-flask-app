    *   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates significantly, with several periods showing negative growth. The later periods are particularly concerning.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility in SBUX's returns.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha is frequently negative, particularly in recent years, indicating that SBUX is underperforming its benchmark after accounting for risk.  This reinforces the earlier observation of underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates, sometimes showing lower volatility than the market (below 1), and sometimes showing higher volatility(above 1).
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has decreased.

    *   20-day SMA: 84.99
    *   60-day SMA: 83.98

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is slightly above all three moving averages. This could indicate a short-term upward trend, but it's not a strong signal in isolation. The fact that the 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs further supports a potential short-term bullish signal.

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -2.6 (Negative - indicating short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -890.1% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, but needs to be interpreted with caution.
    *   The RSI is close to neutral (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   The PPO is positive, suggesting that short-term price momentum is slightly stronger than long-term momentum.
    *   The hybrid signal suggests buying 100% of cash.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence indicates a recent downward trend compared to the S&P 500.
    *   The highly negative expected return is a major red flag, indicating that long-term investment at the current price might be very unfavorable.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, the investment outlook for SBUX is uncertain and carries considerable risk.

The analyst optimism should be viewed in light of the concerning financial data.
