**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There doesn't appear to be a clear trend, with some quarters showing higher EPS and some showing higher revenue.  There is a duplication of the data for 2025-01-28. This inconsistency needs to be addressed.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | 9.40 B$    |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | 9.11 B$    |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | 8.56 B$    |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90 | 9.43 B$    |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.90 | 9.43 B$    |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable over the last five quarters, although there's some fluctuation. Profit margins are generally high and stable, averaging around 26%.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.40B | 24.49% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.07B | 26.25% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.11B | 27.91% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.56B | 25.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.43B | 27.51% |

**Capital and Profitability:**  Negative equity is a significant concern.  ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity. This needs further investigation.

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $-7.47B | -10.45% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-7.45B | -12.21% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-7.95B | -13.28% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-8.45B | -9.14% |
| 2023-12-31 | $-8.62B | -11.89% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has shown periods of strong performance, indicated by positive alpha in some periods, but overall has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered. The high beta suggests substantial volatility. While recent price action shows a short-term uptrend, overbought RSI levels suggest caution.  The negative ROE and negative equity are major red flags that require further analysis to understand the underlying causes.  The provided -29% expected return needs further explanation.  Before making any investment decision, a more thorough investigation into the fundamental reasons behind the negative equity and ROE, along with clarification on data inconsistencies and the methodology of the expected return calculation is crucial.
