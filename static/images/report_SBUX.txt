**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying Alpha and Beta values across different periods.  Alpha, representing excess return compared to the market, generally increased over time, implying increasing outperformance relative to the market in later years. However, the negative CAGR in recent years (2021-2025) and high Beta (1.5-2.4) suggest significant market sensitivity and potential volatility.  The negative CAGR highlights a period of underperformance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, experiencing a substantial price drop. While technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the negative expected return and concerning financial metrics (negative equity and ROE) raise significant concerns.  The large negative expected return needs further investigation as to the reasons behind it.  The recent price drop warrants further examination to understand the underlying causes, including whether it is due to market factors, company-specific news, or other factors. A thorough fundamental analysis is needed to assess the long-term prospects of SBUX and the validity of the -62.7% expected return projection.  The negative equity and ROE are major red flags requiring immediate attention and investigation.
