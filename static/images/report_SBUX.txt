* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.15

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally remains high, EPS fluctuates. More detailed analysis is required to determine the trend and underlying factors driving these fluctuations.  There is a duplication of data for 2024-07-30.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is showing significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, with a negative expected return over the long term.  While short-term indicators suggest some upward momentum, the longer-term trend appears bearish.  The negative equity and ROE are major concerns raising serious questions about the financial health of the company.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative expected return and the alarming financial figures.  The high beta suggests significant risk.  Before investing, a thorough review of the company's financials and strategic direction is crucial.  The data provided suggests that SBUX is currently a high-risk investment with a low probability of outperforming the market.
