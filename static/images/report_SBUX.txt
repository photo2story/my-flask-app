**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

Based on the provided data, SBUX is currently facing significant challenges. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500, with negative alpha and increasing beta. Recent price declines, coupled with negative earnings revisions and a concerning financial position (negative equity, declining profit margins), suggest caution. While the RSI indicates an oversold condition, potentially signaling a short-term rebound, the overall outlook is unfavorable. Recent news highlighting volatility and major business events adds to the uncertainty. The recommendation is to proceed with caution and closely monitor future developments. The hybrid signal suggesting a high cash position further reinforces this cautious approach. The negative expected return significantly lower than the S&P 500 highlights the high risk associated with investing in SBUX at this time.
