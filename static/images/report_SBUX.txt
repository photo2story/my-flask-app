## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves.  Over the period analyzed, SBUX's cumulative return (49.33%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%). The difference is -69.0%, placing it at the 18th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market benchmark in various periods, but this is largely overshadowed by the significant negative overall return.  The beta values remain consistently high (around 108), indicating high sensitivity to market movements.  The high beta is consistent with the significant underperformance observed during market downturns (2021-2023 and 2022-2024 show negative CAGR and high MDD).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $95.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.74
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.13

The current price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend but a longer-term downward trend compared to the recent past.  The recent price change (+0.74%) from the previous close signals a slight upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.68 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.63 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Divergence:** -1.1% (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -64.5% (Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is predicted.)

The RSI nearing overbought levels coupled with a negative relative strength divergence suggests a potential correction might be imminent. The positive PPO indicates short-term bullish momentum. The high price change from the previous close might be part of a temporary bounce or a short-lived trend reversal given the overall negative context.  The expected negative return highlights significant underperformance risk compared to the S&P 500 over at least two years.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE           |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $-7.45B     | -12.21%       |
| 2024-06-30  | $-7.95B     | -13.28%       |

| 2023-09-30  | $-7.99B     | -15.25%       |

Negative equity values are a significant concern, indicating the company has more liabilities than assets.  The negative ROE further emphasizes poor profitability and financial distress. This warrants deep investigation into the company's balance sheet and debt levels.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a substantial negative expected return over the long term. While some short-term positive indicators exist (positive PPO), negative equity, negative ROE, and considerable volatility suggest substantial financial risks.  The negative equity is a major red flag that needs immediate attention.  The data indicates a high risk profile with a considerable chance of further losses.  Further investigation into the companyâ€™s debt levels and business strategy is critical before considering any investment.  The provided data strongly suggests avoiding this stock at this time.
