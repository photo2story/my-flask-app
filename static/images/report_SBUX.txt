* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  The provided data doesn't offer a specific long-term expected return, only stating that long-term investment (over 2 years) may not exceed the S&P 500. The current price of $89.90, being significantly below recent moving averages, does not suggest immediate significant price movement (i.e., sharp rebound or drop). The oversold RSI, however, might suggest a potential bounce.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:**  Revenue has fluctuated between $8.56B and $9.43B over the past four quarters, showing no clear consistent upward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS also shows fluctuation.  There's no consistent trend – ranging from $0.68 to $1.00.

There is no information on whether these numbers beat or missed expectations.  A complete analysis requires expected earnings data for comparison.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has generally remained stable but not shown significant growth. Profit margins fluctuate between approximately 25% and 29%, suggesting reasonable profitability but with some quarter-to-quarter variance.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Negative equity figures across all quarters indicate a significant negative shareholder equity position. ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on equity. This is a significant cause for concern.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the past two days) earnings news or market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights are provided.  This section requires additional information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the negative trend and negative ROE raise serious concerns. While the revenue remains relatively stable, the fluctuating EPS, negative equity, and negative ROE paint a concerning picture of the company's financial health.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons for this underperformance, the sustainability of its current revenue levels, and the path to profitability and positive equity. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more complete assessment.  The 0% expected return suggests the market does not see a significant long-term outperformance potential compared to the S&P 500.  More information, especially regarding earnings expectations and recent news, is vital for a more thorough analysis.

**8.  Recommendation:**

Given the current data,  a cautious approach is warranted.  The significant underperformance relative to the market, negative ROE, and negative equity raise considerable red flags.  Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, including researching the reasons for the company's underperformance and reviewing any recent news or analyst reports before making any investment decisions.  Additional financial information and analysis are needed to determine if the current oversold conditions present a buying opportunity, or if the underlying issues indicate a more prolonged period of underperformance.
