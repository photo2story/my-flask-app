**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly. While the RSI suggests the stock might be oversold,  negative PPO, negative expected return, and significantly negative equity and ROE raise serious concerns.  The recent price drop adds to the bearish sentiment.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative equity and the inconsistent EPS is crucial.  The high relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the negative financial metrics suggest a cautious approach to investing in SBUX at this time.  A long-term investment might be risky given the current financial state and the consistently negative alpha in the past few years.
