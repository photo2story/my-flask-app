**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $112.55
* 5-day Moving Average: $112.21
* 20-day Moving Average: $106.47
* 60-day Moving Average: $99.24

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* RSI: 81.98 (Overbought) – Indicates potential for a price correction.
* PPO: 0.216 (Positive) – Suggests a bullish momentum.
* Relative Divergence (20-day): -1.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years): -29.0% (Expected to underperform the S&P 500 significantly over the long term)

The high RSI suggests the stock is overbought, increasing the risk of a near-term price decline.  The negative long-term expected return compared to S&P 500 is a concern.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-01-28 | $0.69 | $9.40 Billion |

| 2024-04-30 | $0.68 | $8.56 Billion |

| 2024-01-30 | $0.90 | $9.43 Billion | (Duplicate entry)


Earnings appear volatile, with fluctuating EPS and revenue figures. Further analysis is needed, including year-over-year comparisons and considering the seasonality of the coffee business.  The duplicated entry for 2024-01-30 needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

No Total Revenue or Gross Profit data was provided, hindering a comprehensive financial analysis. This missing data is crucial for assessing the company's overall financial health and profitability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX shows a mixed performance. While it has experienced periods of strong growth, it consistently underperforms the S&P 500 over the long term, with a significant negative expected return.  High volatility (indicated by beta), an overbought RSI, and volatile earnings, alongside the lack of key financial information, suggest caution.  Further analysis with complete financial data is needed to fully assess the investment potential.  Currently, the data suggests a high-risk, potentially high-reward but probably not ideal long-term investment, depending on individual risk tolerance and investment goals.
