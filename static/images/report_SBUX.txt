## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves.  The cumulative return of SBUX (43.82%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (113.65%) over the measured period.  The difference is -69.8%, placing it at the 17.5th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided range of -95.0% to 49.4%.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in SBUX's performance compared to the S&P 500. While there were periods of strong outperformance (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020), recent years have seen substantial underperformance.  The consistently low alpha (around 0.1) suggests that SBUX hasn't consistently generated excess returns above the market benchmark (Beta is significantly higher than 1, indicating high market sensitivity).  Market capitalization has generally increased over the period.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+7.1):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend.

The provided expected return of -64.1% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant negative projection.  Considering the current price of $92.17 is near the lower end of its recent range and below its moving averages, a short term recovery is possible, but the long term outlook appears significantly less promising compared to the S&P 500.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has shown significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the given period. While technical indicators suggest the stock might be oversold, creating a potential short-term bounce, the long-term outlook remains weak. Negative equity and ROE raise substantial concerns about the company's financial health.  The lack of consistent revenue or EPS growth trends, combined with the significantly negative long-term projected return against the S&P 500, indicates a high-risk investment.  More information is needed regarding the negative expected return (-64.1%), particularly what factors drive such a significant negative projection.  Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The company's financial health appears to be significantly weaker than is indicated by its revenue figures.
