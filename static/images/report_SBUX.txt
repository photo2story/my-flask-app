## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a global coffeehouse chain.  Over the review period, SBUX's cumulative return (53.81%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 120.36%. The difference is -66.6%, placing it in the 19.7th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows fluctuating CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), with periods of strong outperformance (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020) followed by periods of significant underperformance (e.g., 2021-2023, 2022-2024).  Alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting minimal outperformance relative to the market,  while Beta remains consistently around 1.0 indicating a similar level of volatility to the market.  The relatively high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures highlight periods of significant risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $97.98
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $94.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.14
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.16

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 60-day moving average indicates the price is not significantly above its longer-term average. The substantial jump from the previous close ($95.13) signifies a recent price surge (approximately 3%).

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (74.47):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.85):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Divergence:**  The negative recent 20-day relative divergence (-0.6) hints at potential short-term weakness despite the recent price surge.
* **Expected Return (-57.7%):** This extremely negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and warrants further investigation into the reasons behind this projection.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While there are instances of high revenue and EPS, there is no clear consistent upward trend. A more detailed analysis comparing year-over-year growth and industry benchmarks would be necessary to draw conclusive insights.  The discrepancy between the two entries for 2024-07-30 requires clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates around $9B, while profit margins remain relatively stable between 25% and 30%, indicating consistent profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative equity is a significant red flag, suggesting the company may have accumulated significant debt.  The negative ROE (Return on Equity) reinforces this concern, showing the company is not generating sufficient returns on invested capital.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has demonstrated periods of strong performance but has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, as reflected in the negative long-term expected return.  Technical indicators show mixed signals, with recent positive price movement possibly nearing an overbought condition.  The company's financial statements reveal significant concerns regarding negative equity and ROE.  This indicates substantial debt and low returns on investment, despite healthy profit margins and relatively stable revenue.  Before making any investment decisions, further in-depth analysis is needed including a deep dive into the company's debt structure, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects.  The extremely negative long-term expected return against the S&P 500 is a major red flag requiring careful consideration.
