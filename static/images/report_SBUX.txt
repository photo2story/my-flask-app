**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $111.45
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $111.64
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $102.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $98.32

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting minor bearish momentum in the short term. However, it's significantly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend over the medium to long term.  A recent price drop of -$0.67 is noted.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 85.06 – This indicates the stock is significantly overbought, suggesting a potential correction is imminent.
* **PPO:** 0.92 – A positive PPO value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.8 – This shows a recent short-term upward trend.

The high RSI despite a recent price drop highlights a possible divergence, where the price is falling while momentum remains strong. This could be a temporary situation or signal a weakening upward trend.  The negative expected return of -28.5% suggests significantly lower long-term returns compared to the S&P 500, but this must be considered in conjunction with the other data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistency. While revenue generally remains high, EPS fluctuates.  There is a duplicated entry for 2025-01-28.  Further investigation into the data source is needed for accuracy.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | $9.40B      |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | $9.11B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | $8.56B      |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90 | $9.43B      |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.90 | $9.43B      | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, with profit margins fluctuating but generally positive.  However, the Capital and Profitability section reveals negative equity and ROE throughout the period.  This is a serious concern and requires further investigation into the company's financial health. Negative equity suggests the company's liabilities exceed its assets.

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $9.40B   | 24.49%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $9.07B   | 26.25%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $9.11B   | 27.91%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $8.56B   | 25.58%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $9.43B   | 27.51%        |

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE       |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31  | $-7.47B  | -10.45%   |
| 2024-09-30  | $-7.45B  | -12.21%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $-7.95B  | -13.28%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $-8.45B  | -9.14%    |
| 2023-12-31  | $-8.62B  | -11.89%   |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX shows a mixed picture. While revenue is generally strong and positive profit margins exist, the negative equity and ROE raise serious concerns about its financial health.  The stock's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, although this underperformance isn't entirely unusual based on historical data.  Technical indicators suggest overbought conditions and potential for a correction.  The negative expected return (-28.5%) compared to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant factor to consider.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough review of the company's financial statements and a deeper dive into the reasons for negative equity are crucial. The inconsistencies in the provided earnings data also need to be addressed.  This analysis suggests caution regarding investing in SBUX at this time.
