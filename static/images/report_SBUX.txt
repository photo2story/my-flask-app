**Recommendation:**

While analysts are optimistic, the significant financial concerns (negative equity, negative ROE, extremely negative expected return) and recent underperformance suggest caution. The high MRI and analyst buy consensus are contradictory signals and should not be taken at face value given the other data. **It would be prudent to avoid or significantly reduce exposure to SBUX until there are clear signs of financial improvement and sustained outperformance.** A deep dive into the reasons for the negative equity and plans to rectify it is essential before considering an investment.
