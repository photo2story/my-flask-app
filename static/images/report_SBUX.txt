The data provided contains inconsistencies (duplicate entries) that need to be resolved for a more accurate assessment.  Before making any investment decisions, a deeper dive into the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is necessary.  The extremely negative expected return requires clarification and further analysis.
