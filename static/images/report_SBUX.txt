Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a global coffeehouse company operating in various countries, offering coffee, tea, pastries, and other food items.

The cumulative return for SBUX is 68.3%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 124.78%.  Therefore, SBUX underperformed VOO by **-56.48%** as of the last data point.  The relative divergence of -25.92% indicates that SBUX's performance falls within the lower quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows fluctuating alpha (ranging from -15.4% to 50.1%) and relatively stable beta (around 1.0), suggesting SBUX's returns are somewhat correlated with the overall market but also exhibits periods of significant outperformance and underperformance. The market capitalization has generally increased over the period.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $98.96
* **20-day Moving Average:** $97.41
* **60-day Moving Average:** $95.84

The stock price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the recent movement is relatively modest. The difference between the closing price and the last market price is minimal.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 62.94 –  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.22 – A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, although it's relatively low.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +4.15 – Indicates a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided expected return of 0% suggests that over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment, the return relative to the S&P 500 is expected to be neutral. This is likely an estimate and not a guarantee.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided data shows some quarterly fluctuations in EPS and revenue. While revenue has remained relatively stable around $9B, EPS shows some volatility.  A more in-depth analysis of these figures, in comparison to analyst forecasts and guidance, is necessary to fully assess the company's performance.  More recent and detailed data is needed for a complete outlook.


**5.  Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively consistent, fluctuating slightly over the quarters. Profit margins are generally healthy, ranging from 25.58% to 29.01%, indicating good profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Negative equity values over all provided quarters is a significant concern, suggesting substantial liabilities exceeding assets. The Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, reflecting a lack of profitability relative to shareholder investment.  This is a very serious issue and requires further investigation to determine underlying causes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  I need access to real-time news sources (like Shacknews, Finbold, etc.) and analyst reports to provide a comprehensive analysis of recent news and market outlook for SBUX.  Without this data, I cannot assess recent earnings announcements, analyst opinions, or performance highlights.


**7. Overall Analysis (Summary of 1-6):**

SBUX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the period considered. While technical indicators point towards a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, the negative equity and ROE from the financial statements raise serious concerns about the company's long-term financial health. The relatively consistent revenue and healthy profit margins offer some positive counterpoint, but the negative equity and ROE drastically overshadow these.  Further investigation is crucial into the reasons behind the negative equity and ROE before making any investment decisions.  Information from recent news sources and analyst reports is needed to provide a more complete picture of the current market sentiment and future prospects.
