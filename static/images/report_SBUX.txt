The difference is -75.2%, placing it at the 13.6th percentile of historical performance relative to VOO (based on the provided min/max range).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta ~0.1 consistently implying low market correlation), with periods of outperformance (e.g., 2017-2020) and significant underperformance (e.g., 2021-2024).  The CAGR fluctuates considerably, highlighting volatility and the lack of consistent market-beating returns.  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) are also notable, indicating significant potential losses during market downturns.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $93.12
* **5-day Moving Average:** $96.99
* **20-day Moving Average:** $99.67
* **60-day Moving Average:** $97.40

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (20.3):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.84):** Shows a bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Strength Change (-7.3%):** Confirms a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  This suggests no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term (2+ years) based on the provided information.  The low price may offer potential gains only if the underlying business fundamentals improve.  The current situation suggests it is highly possible the stock will continue to underperform the index.

**Given the current price of $93.12 is below all the moving averages and technical indicators showing bearish signals, there is no indication of a sharp rebound (or even a rebound).**

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue. While revenue generally remains above $9B, EPS shows volatility.  There's no consistent upward trend in EPS, and no information is provided to compare actual results to expectations, preventing assessment of beats or misses.  Revenue growth trends are inconsistent, exhibiting both periods of growth and decline.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue figures show some fluctuation, not exhibiting a clear upward trend.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are relatively stable, though there is a slight downward trend evident in the latest quarter.
* **Equity:**  Negative equity throughout the period indicates significant liabilities outweighing assets. This is a serious concern.
* **ROE:** Negative Return on Equity demonstrates the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital. This reflects the negative equity and raises serious concerns about the company's financial health.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news or market outlook is provided.  Therefore, any analysis of analyst opinions or performance highlights based on recent news is impossible.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but negative financial indicators (negative equity and ROE), inconsistent earnings, and lack of recent positive news raise significant concerns. While the low price might appear attractive, the underlying financial health and weak relative performance warrant caution.  The current situation suggests that potential gains are highly dependent on fundamental improvements in the business. The significant underperformance against the market should be taken into account before any investment decision.
