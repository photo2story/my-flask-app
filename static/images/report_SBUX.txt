**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuations in EPS and revenue. While revenue generally stays above $9B, EPS shows variability, which might contribute to the price volatility and underperformance against the S&P 500. Further analysis is needed to determine the drivers of this variability.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | $9.40B      |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | $9.11B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | $8.56B      |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90 | $9.43B      |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.90 | $9.43B      |


**6. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals a concerning trend in equity and ROE.  Negative equity throughout the period indicates a significant amount of liabilities exceeding assets.  The negative ROE shows the company isn't generating returns on equity. This necessitates careful scrutiny of the company's balance sheet and operational efficiency. Profit margins, while relatively high, need to be analyzed against the backdrop of negative equity and ROE.

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin | Equity   | ROE      |
|-------------|----------|---------------|----------|----------|
| 2024-12-31  | $9.40B   | 24.49%        | $-7.47B  | -10.45%  |
| 2024-09-30  | $9.07B   | 26.25%        | $-7.45B  | -12.21%  |
| 2024-06-30  | $9.11B   | 27.91%        | $-7.95B  | -13.28%  |
| 2024-03-31  | $8.56B   | 25.58%        | $-8.45B  | -9.14%   |
| 2023-12-31  | $9.43B   | 27.51%        | $-8.62B  | -11.89%  |


**7. Overall Analysis and Conclusion:**

SBUX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  While the company boasts high revenue and profit margins, the negative equity, negative ROE, and bearish technical indicators paint a concerning picture.  The recent price bounce might be temporary.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  The -81.4% expected return indicates a substantial risk of further losses, particularly in the short term.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy needs a thorough risk assessment and careful consideration of these negative factors, before any decision is taken.  Further investigation into the company's debt levels and operational strategies is crucial.
