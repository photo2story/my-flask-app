## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

This report analyzes Starbucks Corp (SBUX), a global coffeehouse chain, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Starbucks' cumulative return (70.71%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (128.31%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -57.6%, placing it in the 25.2nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates that Starbucks' performance has lagged behind the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows a beta consistently around 1.4-1.6, suggesting Starbucks' price movements are somewhat correlated with the overall market.  However, the alpha varies significantly between periods, indicating periods of both outperformance (positive alpha) and underperformance (negative alpha) relative to the market. The negative alpha in the most recent period is particularly notable.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Close:** $101.84 (Last Market: $100.57)
* **5-day MA:** $100.20
* **20-day MA:** $98.26
* **60-day MA:** $96.26

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the last market price and the closing price suggests a stable or slightly positive market reaction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (65.29):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.33):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):**  Positive change (+1.0), reinforcing the short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  This indicates that at the current juncture, the model predicts no excess return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  This aligns with the overall underperformance observed relative to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show some fluctuation,  with EPS showing a decline from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 before recovering slightly in Q2 2024 and Q3 2024.  Revenue is relatively stable.  To provide a full assessment, the expected earnings for the most recent quarter are needed.  The data suggests some short-term volatility, but a clear trend is not established without the expected earnings.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Profit margins show some variability, but generally remain healthy, ranging from 25% to nearly 30%.  The revenue is fairly consistent, hovering around $9 billion.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Negative equity is concerning and suggests a high level of leverage. The negative ROE across all quarters indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity investment. This is a significant red flag and requires further investigation into the company's capital structure and strategy.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**  

*(This section requires information from sources like Shacknews, FINBOLD, and other financial news outlets.  Please provide news articles and analyst opinions for a complete analysis.)*  Analysis of recent news and analyst opinions would reveal current market sentiment and outlook, and potentially highlight any recent catalysts affecting the stock price (e.g., new product launches, competitive pressures, economic factors).

**7. Overall Analysis (Summary of 1-6):**

Starbucks has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the observed period. While short-term technical indicators suggest a mildly bullish sentiment, negative alpha, negative ROE,  and consistent negative equity raise serious concerns about the long-term prospects of the company.  Further investigation into the negative equity and ROE is crucial.  The inclusion of recent news and analyst opinions would provide a more complete picture of the current market sentiment and potential catalysts. The current relatively flat expected return suggests that the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated to continue.


**8. Recommendations:**

Based on the provided data and current analysis, a cautious approach to investing in SBUX is warranted. Further investigation into the causes of negative equity and ROE and a thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions are critical before making any investment decision.  The consistent underperformance relative to the market and the concerning financial metrics presented, suggests that the stock warrants further and deeper due diligence before any investment is made.
