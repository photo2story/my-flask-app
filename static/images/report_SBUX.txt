Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted. While the recent price action and MRI might suggest a potential buying opportunity, the long-term expected return, negative equity, and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 are significant red flags. Investors should carefully monitor the news, company announcements, and financial performance before making any investment decisions. The hybrid signal's cautious buying approach seems like a reasonable stance.
