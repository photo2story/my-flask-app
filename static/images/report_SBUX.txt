*   **Analysis:** SBUX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The divergence of -100.4% indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns. A relative divergence of 3.7 suggests this performance is near the bottom of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha     | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| 2024-2026 | -2.0%   | 81.9%   | -108.0% | -0.0 | 96.2  |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** The negative Compound Annual Growth Rate (-2.0%) indicates a decline in investment value over the 2024-2026 period.
    *   **MDD:** The high Maximum Drawdown (81.9%) suggests significant risk and volatility, with potential for substantial losses from peak to trough.
    *   **Alpha:** The deeply negative Alpha (-108.0%) means the investment has significantly underperformed its benchmark, even considering the market's risk.
    *   **Beta:** A Beta of -0.0 indicates that the investment has a negligible to negative correlation with the overall market. In the provided context, with the values of other factors, it seems more likely to be unreliable and not indicative of anything.
    *   **Cap(B):** 96.2B Market Cap.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 85.25
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 84.62, Previous Close: 85.25, Change: -0.74
*   **Moving Averages:**

    *   60-day SMA: 84.3147

*   **Analysis:** The current price shows a slight decrease compared to the previous close. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, indicating a potential short-term downward trend. The 60-day SMA being below the 20-day SMA suggests a more established, but weaker, longer-term upward trend.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 59.66 (Approaching overbought, but not there yet)
*   **PPO:** -0.1127 (Slightly negative, suggesting a minor downtrend relative to a longer moving average)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Suggests a strong buy signal based on a specific algorithm. Recommends investing 0.8% of total investment monthly.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3 (Negative, indicating a short-term decline relative to the comparison stock.)
*   **Price Change:** The price change of -0.74 highlights recent fluctuation.
*   **Expected Return:** -1431.7%.  This is an extremely negative and concerning figure, indicating a predicted *massive* underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.

*   **Analysis:** The MRI score suggests a high investment recommendation, seemingly contradicting the negative expected return and underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The RSI indicates the stock is approaching overbought conditions. The negative PPO confirms the recent negative divergence change (-1.3) and the potential short-term downtrend indicated by moving averages. The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.
