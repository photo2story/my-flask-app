## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Relative Strength:**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a global coffeehouse chain.  The cumulative return of SBUX is 44.31%, significantly lagging the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 118.39%. The difference is -74.1%, placing it at the 14.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting minimal outperformance relative to the market (Beta), although this value alone does not reveal the full context of the investment's returns.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $92.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $95.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.93

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the 20-day and 60-day moving averages might signal potential for a bounce back.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (28.17):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.54):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (1.1):** Shows a short-term upward trend, likely influenced by the oversold conditions.
* **Expected Return (-79.9%):** This significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) suggests potential significant underperformance.  The closing price of $92.25, while not exceptionally high given the moving average data, doesn't signal any extreme price movement (no evidence of a sudden sharp increase or decrease).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates around $9 Billion, showing no consistent upward trend over the period.
* **EPS:** Similarly inconsistent, ranging from $0.68 to $1.00. There is no clear discernible trend.  There is a duplicate entry for 2024-07-30.

Without access to expectations,  it's impossible to assess whether these results "beat" or "missed" expectations.  The data alone does not reveal a conclusive trend in either revenue or EPS.

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable around $9B, with profit margins fluctuating between 25% and 29%. There's no clear long-term trend.
* **Capital & Profitability:**  Negative equity throughout the period, with negative ROE indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity.  This is a significant concern.

This section requires information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions and bearish momentum, although short-term indicators show a small positive change in relative strength.
