The high beta values consistently show a high sensitivity to market movements. Market capitalization has generally increased but fluctuates.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 1.0% | 58.4% | -32.0% | 55.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 3.0% | 59.1% | -18.0% | 64.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 55.0% | 59.1% | 21.0% | 89.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 63.0% | 61.7% | 33.0% | 110.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 53.0% | 61.7% | -7.0% | 123.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -27.0% | 66.9% | -36.0% | 107.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -29.0% | 68.1% | -50.0% | 105.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -32.0% | 68.1% | -2.4 | 103.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $81.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $81.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $100.95

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $1.33 (1.65%) could be interpreted as a temporary bounce, not necessarily a reversal of the trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 30.48 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.32 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.7 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -81.1% (This extremely negative figure requires further clarification on the methodology used to calculate this long-term expectation.  It suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.)

The recent price increase of $1.33 from the previous close reflects a small positive change but shouldn't be misinterpreted as a significant trend reversal given the overall bearish indicators and price action.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-01-28 | $0.69 | $9.40B      |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.93 | $9.11B      |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.68 | $8.56B      |
| 2024-01-30 | $0.90 | $9.43B      |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.90 | $9.43B      | *(Duplicate data point, likely an error)*


Earnings show some volatility, with EPS fluctuating between quarters. Revenue remains relatively stable, though there's some fluctuation.  Further analysis of the cost of goods sold and operating expenses would be needed to thoroughly assess the profitability of these earnings.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.40B | 24.49% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.07B | 26.25% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.11B | 27.91% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.56B | 25.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.43B | 27.51% |

Profit margins are generally healthy but show some fluctuation.  Further investigation into the drivers of these fluctuations is necessary.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $-7.47B | -10.45% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-7.45B | -12.21% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-7.95B | -13.28% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-8.45B | -9.14% |
| 2023-12-31 | $-8.62B | -11.89% |

Negative equity and ROE are concerning and warrant further investigation into the company's capital structure and profitability.  This is a significant red flag.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently exhibiting signs of weakness. While it has shown periods of strong outperformance against the S&P 500, recent performance has been significantly poor.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but the negative ROE and negative equity raise significant concerns about the company's financial health.  The extremely negative projected return needs further investigation to understand its basis.  Before considering a long-term investment, a thorough analysis of the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is crucial.  The negative equity and ROE are major red flags that outweigh the oversold technical indicators.  The -81.1% expected return is likely flawed and needs further explanation.  More data and detailed financial analysis are required for a robust investment decision.
