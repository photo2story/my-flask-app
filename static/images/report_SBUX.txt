**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $83.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $82.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $100.41

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price increase of $1.27 (from $82.81) is a positive signal but still within a bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.12 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.23 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but weak)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** -3.5% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -95.6%  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon requires further investigation and clarification as to the calculation method.  It strongly suggests severe underperformance is projected. The provided data does not justify such a drastic prediction.

The recent price increase suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS and revenue data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries for 2025-01-28.  A clearer presentation of the data is needed for meaningful analysis.  However,  the data suggests some volatility in both EPS and revenue,  with no clear upward or downward trend apparent from the incomplete and inconsistent information provided.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | $9.40 B     |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | $9.11 B     |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | $8.56 B     |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90 | $9.43 B     |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.90 | $9.43 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows relatively stable revenues but inconsistent and negative profitability measures (ROE and Equity).  The negative equity is a significant red flag and requires further investigation into the company's balance sheet. The profit margins fluctuate but generally remain positive.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.40B | 24.49% |

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SBUX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, with a high beta indicating strong correlation with market movements but negative alpha showcasing underperformance relative to the market. The recent price movement shows signs of a potential short-term bounce, but it's currently below its moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  Technical indicators are mixed, and the negative expected return (-95.6%) is alarming and needs further investigation into its calculation and underlying assumptions. The inconsistent earnings data and negative equity reported in the financial information are serious concerns that require further investigation before making any investment decisions.  The negative ROE across multiple quarters also raises significant questions about the company's financial health and future prospects.  More complete and consistent data is crucial for a thorough and reliable analysis.
