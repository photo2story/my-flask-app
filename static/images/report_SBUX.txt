    **Analysis:**

    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows fluctuating performance, with periods of significant growth (2017-2020) followed by declines. Recent years (2020-2025) have seen negative CAGR values.
    *   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for losses during downturns.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha is largely negative, suggesting that Starbucks has underperformed relative to its risk level, except during the 2017-2020 period.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, suggesting that Starbucks' price is not very sensitive to market movements (S&P 500).
    *   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization grew significantly from 2015 to 2021, but has since seen a decline.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 89.42
*   **Previous Close:** 85.21
*   **Change:** 4.94
*   **5-day SMA:** 86.09
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.21
*   **60-day SMA:** 84.23

**Analysis:** The stock is trading above all its short-term and long-term moving averages (5, 20, and 60 days). This suggests a possible short-term upward trend. The significant price increase (change of 4.94) relative to the previous close indicates a strong recent rebound.

**3) RSI, PPO & Hybrid Signal Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 56.83 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)

*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 3.2 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -962.4%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI indicates a neutral market sentiment.
*   The PPO suggests slight bullish momentum, but it is not strong enough to be decisively bullish.
*   The hybrid signal recommend to invest the full amount of cash and to re-invest monthly.
*   The recent increase in relative divergence confirms the short-term upward trend.
*   The extremely negative expected return is a major concern. This suggests that, based on current indicators, a long-term investment in Starbucks is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Signals:** The news items from 2025-12-18 suggest positive sentiment, with investors seeing a potential turnaround and the stock outperforming competitors. The Forbes article on selling puts also implies a level of confidence in the stock's near-term price.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The Motley Fool article questions how good the stock *has* been, which implies a less optimistic long-term view.
*   **Other News:** The dividend declaration is generally positive. The Seattle CEO pay news, while potentially interesting from a corporate governance perspective, may not have a direct impact on the stock's performance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.36)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 94.13 (Suggests slight upside from current price)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No specific rating changes are provided.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and a target price slightly above the current price. However, without knowing the dates or prior ratings for the "Recent Rating Changes," it's difficult to assess the strength of this consensus.

*   **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue has generally been strong, with a slight increase in the most recent quarter. Profit margins have fluctuated, with a decrease compared to the end of 2024.
*   **Capital & Profitability:** The negative equity is a significant concern. The negative Return on Equity (ROE) reflects the company's struggles to generate profits from its equity base. The situation seems to be improving, but still requires attention.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** Starbucks has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial negative divergence.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While recent stock price movements show a short-term upward trend, the long-term expected return is deeply negative.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts have a "Buy" consensus, but the absence of recent rating changes data makes it hard to value their reliability.
*   **Financial Concerns:** The negative equity and negative ROE are major concerns, raising questions about the company's long-term financial health.
*   **News & Events:** Recent news is mixed, with some positive signals of a potential turnaround but also some cautionary notes.
*   **Alpha/Beta:** The Alpha/Beta analysis suggests a volatile stock with the high maximum drawdown, with a low correlation to the S&P 500.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Investing in Starbucks at this point presents a mixed picture. The recent positive price movement and analyst ratings offer some encouragement. However, the deeply negative expected return, negative equity, and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 should give investors pause. The news items suggest a potential turnaround, but the financial data indicates underlying challenges. A decision to invest should be made with caution, considering both the potential upside and the significant risks involved. Further investigation into the company's financial health and turnaround strategy is recommended.
