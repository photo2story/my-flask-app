* Closing Price: $92.25
* 5-Day Moving Average: $92.68
* 20-Day Moving Average: $92.22
* 60-Day Moving Average: $96.25

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting minor short-term bearish pressure.  It's very close to the 20-day average, indicating a neutral short-term trend. The price is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more pronounced downtrend in the medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 59.5  (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* PPO: 0.4 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* 20-Day Relative Strength Divergence: +1.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term): -58.5% (Significant underperformance expected over the long term compared to the S&P 500)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO and relative strength divergence suggest some bullish momentum, the RSI is not strongly bullish, and the expected return indicates significant long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The current price of $92.25 does not indicate any significant recent rapid price movements (either up or down).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX shows signs of recent underperformance compared to the broader market (S&P 500). While profit margins are relatively healthy, the negative equity and ROE are major concerns.  Recent earnings data is somewhat volatile, and technical indicators offer a mixed signal. The significant negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term makes a strong case for caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative equity and ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests that SBUX is currently a high-risk investment.
