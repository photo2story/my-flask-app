**4. Recent Financials & Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show some volatility.  While revenue has generally been strong, EPS shows fluctuation.  To provide a more thorough analysis, the following is needed:  (a) comparison to analyst expectations for the reported quarters, (b) insights into the factors driving the fluctuations in both revenue and EPS.  Simply stating the figures without comparison or analysis is insufficient.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been consistently above $8.5 Billion, demonstrating stability.  Profit margins are also healthy, fluctuating between 25% and 29%, indicative of good financial health.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative equity and ROE values raise concerns.  This requires further investigation to determine the underlying causes.  Negative equity may be a result of accounting practices or aggressive expansion strategies, and further analysis is needed to determine its significance.


**6. News and Recent Issues (requires further information):**

This section needs information from recent news sources (Shaknews, Finbold, etc.) to provide insights into recent earnings announcements, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.  Without this external information, a comprehensive analysis cannot be performed.


**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

SBUX has demonstrated some strengths (consistent revenue, healthy profit margins) but also weaknesses (underperformance relative to VOO, negative equity, fluctuating EPS).  Recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend, but technical indicators are mixed.  The analysis is significantly hampered by missing information.  To form a strong conclusion, we need:

* **Comparison of reported financials to analyst expectations.**
* **An explanation of the negative equity.**
* **Analysis of recent news and analyst opinions.**
* **Clarification of the 0.0% expected return and the basis for the long-term outperformance claim.**

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the incomplete data and mixed signals, forming a definitive recommendation (buy, hold, sell) is impossible.  A thorough review incorporating the missing data is necessary before making an informed investment decision.
