| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2016-2018  | 2.0% | 11.9% | -17.0% | 0.3 | 64.5 |
| 2017-2019  | 54.0% | 11.9% | 23.0% | 1.2 | 89.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 79.0% | 15.3% | 52.0% | 1.0 | 111.5 |
| 2019-2021  | 64.0% | 15.3% | -7.0% | 1.0 | 123.9 |
| 2020-2022  | 9.0% | 17.4% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 107.6 |
| 2021-2023  | -16.0% | 17.4% | -39.0% | 1.4 | 106.3 |
| 2022-2024  | -17.0% | 17.4% | -50.0% | 1.5 | 103.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 1.0% | 13.7% | -57.0% | 1.1 | 128.6 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $113.19
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $112.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $110.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $100.31

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates a recent period of consolidation rather than a dramatic increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.34 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** -0.37 (Slightly bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.9 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -25.1%

The RSI suggests the stock might be nearing overbought conditions, indicating a potential pullback. The negative PPO reinforces the possibility of a short-term correction. However, the positive relative divergence suggests continued upward momentum in the short term. The long-term expected return is significantly negative compared to the S&P 500, mirroring the cumulative return analysis. The price change of $1.29 represents a small percentage increase and does not suggest a sudden dramatic move.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-01-28 | $0.69 | $9.40 B      |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.93 | $9.11 B      |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.68 | $8.56 B      |
| 2024-01-30 | $0.90 | $9.43 B      |
| 2023-01-28 | $0.90 | $9.43 B      |

Earnings show some volatility.  A more detailed analysis, including revenue growth and cost analysis, would be needed to draw definitive conclusions.  There seems to be some inconsistency in the data (two entries for 2025-01-28 and 2023-01-28) which needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.40B | 24.49%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.07B | 26.25%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.11B | 27.91%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.56B | 25.58%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.43B | 27.51%       |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE      |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-7.47B | -10.45%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $-7.45B | -12.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $-7.95B | -13.28%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $-8.45B | -9.14%    |
| 2023-12-31 | $-8.62B | -11.89%   |

Revenue remains relatively stable, although profit margins show some fluctuation.  However, the **negative equity** across all quarters is a significant concern and requires further investigation.  Negative Return on Equity (ROE) indicates the company is not generating returns on its invested capital. This needs further analysis to understand underlying causes.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the period considered. While recent short-term price movements suggest a potential uptrend, technical indicators hint at the possibility of a correction.  The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500, coupled with negative equity and ROE, raises major concerns about the company's financial health.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the negative equity and inconsistent earnings data is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data points to potential risks, requiring a thorough fundamental analysis to evaluate the long-term prospects of SBUX.
