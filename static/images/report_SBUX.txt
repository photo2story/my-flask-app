    The most recent earnings report for Q2 2024 shows that Starbucks missed analyst expectations on both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue. The company reported an EPS of $0.93, falling short of the expected $0.98. Revenue also came in slightly lower than expected, reaching $9.11 billion.

**Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently underperforming the S&P 500. The company has missed its recent earnings expectations. While technical indicators suggest potential for upward momentum in the long term,  the recent underperformance and technical indicators suggest that SBUX may face short-term downward pressure. Investors should closely monitor earnings announcements and future market trends for further insight. The high expected return of 69.64% is promising, but it is important to remember that this is a projected return and may not be realized.
