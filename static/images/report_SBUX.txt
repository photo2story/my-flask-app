*   **Expected Return (%):** -890.1%

**Analysis:**

*   Despite the negative expected return, the MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" rating. This is a conflicting signal. It's crucial to understand the model behind the MRI and why it's giving this recommendation despite the poor expected return and underperformance.
*   The negative trend in divergence (-2.6) is aligned with the longer-term divergence, which suggests that the underperformance of SBUX compared to the S&P 500 is an ongoing trend.
*   The hybrid signal is optimistic but it is based on data that is conflicting with the overall analysis of the stock.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**
