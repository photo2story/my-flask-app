## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a global coffeehouse company operating in various countries.  Over the period analyzed, SBUX's cumulative return (55.11%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (122.16%). The difference is -67.1%, placing it at the 19.3rd percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance over various periods, with positive CAGR in some years and negative in others. The alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting slight outperformance, but the negative CAGR in recent years overshadows this. The beta (around 0.1 to 0.1 consistently) is significantly lower than 1, indicating much lower volatility than the market.  However, the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values suggest considerable risk even with low volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $98.81
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $93.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.23

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price increase of $0.82 reflects a positive change.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (83.95):**  Indicates the stock is currently in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (0.98):**  A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but the high RSI suggests caution.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (0.7 +):** Shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.

The large positive price change ($0.82) does reflect some upward momentum, but the high RSI and the significantly negative expected return (-60%) warn against strong bullishness. The expected return being significantly negative suggests that even with long-term investment (2+ years), significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally remains above $9 Billion, EPS fluctuates.  There's no clear upward or downward trend evident in this short timeframe, requiring longer-term data for a conclusive analysis.  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-07-30.


| Date       | EPS | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | $9.11 B     |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | $8.56 B     |

| 2024-07-30 | 1.00 | $9.17 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial statements show some concerns. While revenue is relatively stable, the Profit Margin shows some fluctuations but generally remains healthy. However, the negative Equity and ROE figures are extremely worrying and indicate significant financial challenges for the company. This needs further investigation into the company's balance sheet and cash flow statements to understand the underlying causes.

|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------|-----------|

| 2024-06-30 | $9.11B    | 27.91%        | $-7.95B    | -13.28%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.56B    | 25.58%        | $-8.45B    | -9.14%    |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.43B    | 27.51%        | $-8.62B    | -11.89%   |
| 2023-09-30 | $9.37B    | 29.01%        | $-7.99B    | -15.25%   |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, despite some periods of positive CAGR.  Technical indicators suggest potential for a pullback, and the negative expected return is a significant concern.  The most concerning aspect is the negative equity and ROE consistently shown in the recent financial statements, suggesting serious underlying financial problems that need to be addressed before considering an investment.  Further research into the company's financial health and future prospects is strongly advised before making any investment decisions.
