*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The table shows a fluctuating alpha, indicating periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  The beta generally increases over time, suggesting that SBUX's price is increasingly sensitive to market movements. Notably, recent years show strongly negative Alpha figures.  CAGR has also been negative in recent periods. The increasing MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is also concerning.

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 85.25

*   **Price Action:** The recent price (85.29) shows a gain from the previous close (84.56) with a change of 0.86. This suggests a positive movement in the very short term. The fact that price is very close to 20-Day moving average while being below the 60-day moving average suggests a short-term uptrend but a longer-term downtrend or consolidation. The fact that the stock price is trading higher with a large change(0.86) shows that it might have a momentum.

    *   The MRI indicates "Low Risk".
    *   The RSI of 33.90 suggests the stock is approaching oversold conditions.
    *   PPO is 0.10, which means the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average.
    *   The hybrid signal suggests a cautiously optimistic approach, recommending buying 80% of available cash with a caution due to the MRI value.
    *   The negative change in relative deviation confirms a short-term downward trend.
    *   The extremely negative expected return is highly concerning. It suggests a strong expectation of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.
