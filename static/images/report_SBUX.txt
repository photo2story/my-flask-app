## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a global coffeehouse chain operating in various countries.  The cumulative return of SBUX is 49.33%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%. The difference is -69.0%, placing it at the 18th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates that SBUX has underperformed the market significantly over the period considered.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta = 0.1, which is suspiciously low and warrants further investigation into the calculation methodology). While some periods showed high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), others, particularly the recent years, experienced substantial negative returns.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) consistently highlights the risk associated with SBUX, reaching -82%.  The alpha values remain consistently low, indicating that SBUX's returns don't significantly exceed market expectations. This low Beta is unusual for a company of this size, suggesting an issue with data calculation or an exceptionally strong hedge against market fluctuations (unlikely given the CAGR and MDD figures).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $95.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.74
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.13

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting potential upward momentum in the short term. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, hinting at a possible longer-term bearish trend.  The price is close to the 5-day and 20-day, so it may be considered somewhat volatile, but not significantly so.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 67.68 – Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, implying potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.63 – A positive value indicates upward momentum, but near zero values suggests some neutral-to-bearish bias.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.1 – This indicates a recent slight weakening of relative performance against the market.
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -64.5% – This strongly suggests underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue. While some quarters show strong performance, others exhibit lower figures.  The inconsistency requires further investigation into the underlying factors driving these fluctuations. The data also appear to contain duplicate entries for July 30, 2024.  This needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93  | 9.11         |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68  | 8.56         |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90  | 9.43         |
| 2023-08-01 | 1.00  | 9.17         |
| **2024-07-30** | **1.00** | **9.17** | *(Duplicate Entry)*

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, though there is some fluctuation from quarter to quarter. Profit margins also show some variability, but generally remain healthy. However, the Capital and Profitability section is concerning. The negative equity and negative ROE (Return on Equity) across all reported quarters indicate significant financial challenges for the company. These figures require deep investigation into the company’s debt, asset valuation, and overall financial health.

| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin (%) | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | 9.07          | 26.25            | -7.45        | -12.21  |
| 2024-06-30 | 9.11          | 27.91            | -7.95        | -13.28  |
| 2024-03-31 | 8.56          | 25.58            | -8.45        | -9.14   |
| 2023-12-31 | 9.43          | 27.51            | -8.62        | -11.89  |
| 2023-09-30 | 9.37          | 29.01            | -7.99        | -15.25  |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some quarters show promising revenue and profit margins, the negative equity and ROE raise serious concerns about its financial stability.  The technical indicators suggest potential for short-term correction, and the long-term outlook is pessimistic based on the provided data.  The suspiciously low Beta figure requires further investigation into data quality.  A thorough examination of the company's financial statements, debt levels, and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions. The data suggest significant risk, and the expected return is considerably negative compared to the market.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the substantial underperformance, negative ROE, and questionable Beta, a cautious approach is advised.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before considering any investment in SBUX.  Investors should carefully analyze the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and management strategies to assess the potential for future improvement.  The provided data does not support a long-term investment in SBUX relative to the S&P 500.  Consideration should be given to other investment options exhibiting stronger financial health and market performance.
