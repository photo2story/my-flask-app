**Analysis:**

*   SBUX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return difference is substantial. The relative deviation suggests this underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range, meaning it's deviated more negatively than usual.
*   The Alpha values are mostly negative, particularly in recent years, indicating underperformance relative to the market. Beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying degrees of correlation (and sometimes inverse correlation) with the market. High MDD values indicate substantial risk. CAGR is also not stable and mostly in the negatives in recent years.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Last Price:** 85.90
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 85.5, 'previousClose': 85.9, 'change': -0.47} (Slight decrease in the last market session)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 84.598
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 83.1705
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 86.2907

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price closed down slightly in the last session.
*   The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average, which can be a short-term bullish signal. However, the price is below the 60-day moving average, which suggests a longer-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 53.81 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.7428 (Positive)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** 3.6 (+) (Short-term increase in relative outperformance)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -699.7 (Significantly negative long-term expected return vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests that the general market conditions favor investment.
*   The RSI is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   PPO above zero suggests positive price momentum.
*   The Hybrid signal recommends a "Buy" with full cash allocation, reflecting a bullish outlook based on the MRI.
*   The recent increase in relative divergence suggests short-term positive momentum for SBUX compared to its recent performance.
*   **The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.** It suggests that, based on the model, SBUX is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term. The recent change of {'price': 85.5, 'previousClose': 85.9, 'change': -0.47} is not considered as a major volatile issue.

**7. Overall Analysis**

Starbucks presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, declining profit margins, negative equity, negative ROE, recent drop in EPS, and an extremely negative long-term expected return. Recent news highlights valuation concerns and declining earnings expectations.

**Conclusion:**

While some indicators suggest short-term positive momentum and analyst support exists, the underlying financial health and long-term outlook for Starbucks appear concerning. The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative equity, declining profit margins, and especially the extremely negative expected return warrant caution. The mixed news flow and price target adjustments reflect uncertainty. **Based on this analysis, a strong degree of caution is warranted before investing in SBUX. Further investigation into the reasons for the negative equity and expected return is highly recommended.**
