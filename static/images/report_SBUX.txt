*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 60.62
*   **PPO:** 0.43

*   **Expected Return (%):** -671.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A medium investment recommendation suggests moderate risk but doesn't account for the significant underperformance.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 60.62 is nearing overbought territory (above 70), suggesting that the stock price may be due for a pullback.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is trending higher than the long-term moving average, but the value is low.
*   **Divergence Change:**  The recent positive change in relative divergence indicates a short-term improvement in performance relative to the S&P 500, however, given its negative figures, that short-term rise is not a reliable signal.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-671%) is very concerning. This suggests that, based on current conditions, long-term investment in SBUX is projected to perform *significantly* worse than the S&P 500.
