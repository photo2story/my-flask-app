*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows inconsistent growth, with negative values in recent periods, indicating poor performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high MDD values across all periods suggest significant risk and volatility. The values are all above 60%, and consistently in the 80% range lately, indicating big downside swings.
*   **Alpha:**  Primarily negative, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark.  The significantly negative Alpha values in recent periods indicate substantial underperformance.
*   **Beta:**  Fluctuates, suggesting varying correlation with the market.  The recent negative Beta values suggest an inverse correlation with the market (though beta on its own is not enough to suggest an inverse relationship).
*   **Cap(B):** The market cap has fluctuated, declining from a peak in 2019-2021.
*   **Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis portrays a concerning picture, especially in recent years. Negative Alpha indicates underperformance, high MDD suggests high volatility, and declining CAGR reflects poor recent returns.

*   **Current Price:** 85.08
*   **Previous Close:** 84.57
*   **Change:** 0.6
*   **5-day SMA:** 85.60
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.41
*   **60-day SMA:** 84.35

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), suggesting a possible short-term upward trend. However, the 5-day SMA is slightly higher than the current price, indicating that momentum may be slowing down. The price increase of 0.6 suggests an uptick in the stock price compared to the previous close.

**3. Market Risk Indicator & Other Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 49.89
*   **PPO:** -0.12
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 2.5 (+) (단기상승 - short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -671.0%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The high MRI suggests that the investment might be considered relatively safe despite the poor returns.
    *   The RSI of 49.89 indicates a neutral condition, neither overbought nor oversold.
    *   A negative PPO implies a slight downward trend.
    *   The hybrid signal indicates a buy recommendation.
    *   The recent relative divergence change indicates a short-term upward trend, as suggested by the "+2.5", but this needs to be taken with the context of overall underperformance.
    *   The expected return is deeply negative, indicating a very pessimistic long-term outlook.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Key Themes:**  The news headlines suggest several concerns:
    *   **Strike Fallout & Union Busting:** Labor issues and potential negative impacts on operations.
    *   **2026 Outlook:** Investor focus on key factors driving future performance.
    *   **Valuation:** Questions about whether the current valuation is justified after recent underperformance.
    *   **Trading Strategies:** Bear call spread suggestions imply a cautious or bearish sentiment among some investors.
*   **Impact:** These headlines indicate both challenges (labor disputes, valuation concerns) and ongoing interest in the company's future.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean of 2.36)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 94.13 (High: 115, Low: 67)

*   **Analysis:**  Despite the negative indicators, analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on the stock and see potential upside (average target price of $94.13).  However, the wide range between the high and low target prices suggests uncertainty. Lack of recent rating changes, suggests analysts could be out of touch with the recent poor performance.

*   **Overall Assessment:** The analysis presents a mixed picture but leans heavily towards caution. While analysts maintain a buy rating, numerous indicators raise concerns about Starbucks' recent performance and financial health.
*   **Key Concerns:**
    *   **Significant Underperformance:**  Substantially lagging the S&P 500.
    *   **Negative Financials:** Negative Equity and negative ROE highlight serious financial issues. Declining profitability and unstable EPS trends.
    *   **High Volatility:** Evidenced by high MDD.
    *   **Labor Issues:**  Strikes and unionization efforts could impact future profitability.
    *   **Pessimistic Outlook:**  The extremely negative expected return suggests significant downside risk.
*   **Potential Positives:**
    *   **Analyst "Buy" Rating:**  Analysts may see potential for a turnaround.
    *   **Short-Term Uptick:** Recent divergence and price movement suggest possible short-term gains (though this needs to be considered in the context of the wider data trends).
    *   **Strong Brand:** Starbucks' brand recognition and global presence remain strong, which could contribute to a future recovery. However, brand alone isn't enough to overcome the issues mentioned.

*   **Recommendation:**  Based on the data provided, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with the negative financials, underperformance, and labor issues. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative equity and the company's plans to address these challenges. The analyst recommendations are the outlier in the data and should be evaluated with a large degree of skepticism, and independent due dilligence is needed.
