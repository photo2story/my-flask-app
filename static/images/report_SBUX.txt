## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a global coffeehouse chain.  The cumulative return for SBUX is 70.16%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 128.86%.  Therefore, SBUX underperformed VOO by 58.7 percentage points at the last data point.  The relative underperformance, considering historical volatility, is at the 24.4th percentile (meaning it's relatively lower than 75.6% of the historical data points).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results. While Alpha (excess return compared to the benchmark) fluctuates, generally staying above 0,  Beta (systematic risk) remains relatively consistent around 1.4-1.6, indicating somewhat higher sensitivity to market movements than the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 101.51
* **5-day Moving Average:** 101.32
* **20-day Moving Average:** 98.7
* **60-day Moving Average:** 96.56

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (66.22):**  Indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.24):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although relatively low.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +0.8, implying a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 0.0%.  This indicates that over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon with regular contributions, the expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 is currently projected at zero.  This needs further investigation, as it is a rather low projection considering the historical context and current market conditions.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show some fluctuation.  While revenue generally remains above $8.5 Billion, EPS shows more variability.  A detailed analysis would require access to the expected earnings for the latest quarter (2024-07-30), which is currently missing from the provided information.  Comparing actual results against those expectations would provide a crucial perspective.


**5. Quarterly Financial Data Analysis (Revenue and Profitability):**

The revenue remains relatively stable around $9 Billion, but profit margin has shown some fluctuations between 25% and 29%, indicating some sensitivity to operational factors and potentially external market circumstances.

**Capital and Profitability:**

Negative equity values (-$7.45B to -$8.62B) are noteworthy and require further investigation. Negative ROE indicates the company isn't generating returns on shareholder equity. This may be due to high levels of debt or other factors, highlighting a significant area of concern needing more scrutiny.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:**  The prompt lacks critical information, including recent news (specifically earnings reports within the last two days from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD), analyst opinions, and detailed market outlook. This data is crucial for a complete assessment of the stock.  Without it, many aspects of the analysis remain incomplete.

**7. Overall Analysis (Summary):**

SBUX shows a mixed picture. While recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend,  the long-term performance lags behind the S&P 500, and concerning financial data (negative equity and ROE) raises serious questions. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a fully comprehensive assessment. The RSI suggests potential short-term correction. The low projected long-term excess return against the S&P 500, coupled with the negative equity, is a major cautionary point.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative equity and ROE, as well as accessing and analyzing recent earnings reports and analyst sentiment, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the incomplete data and the concerning financial information (negative equity and ROE), a thorough due diligence process is critical.  Seek additional information from reliable sources like financial news websites (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, etc.), company filings, and analyst reports before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The currently available data alone does not suggest a strong buy recommendation.
