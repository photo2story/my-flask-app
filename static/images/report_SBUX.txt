| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

SBUX's price has experienced a recent decline.  The price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), signaling a bearish trend.  The significant gap between the current price and the moving averages indicates a considerable downtrend. The -3.9% change from the previous close reinforces the recent negative momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 29.72 suggests the stock is in oversold territory, indicating potential for a bounce. However, the negative PPO (-1.64) suggests bearish momentum. The recent relative divergence change of -3.8 points to a short-term downward trend.  The low Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests relatively low risk.  The extremely negative expected return (-77.6%) compared to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally remains above $9B, EPS fluctuates.  Further analysis is needed to determine the drivers of this volatility and assess its impact on future performance.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | 9.40 B$ |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | 9.11 B$ |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | 8.56 B$ |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.9 | 9.43 B$ |
| 2025-01-28 | 0.9 | 9.43 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals consistent revenue around $9B, but profitability (profit margin) fluctuates. The negative equity and Return on Equity (ROE) raise concerns about the company's financial health.  This needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.40B | 24.49% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.07B | 26.25% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.11B | 27.91% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.56B | 25.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.43B | 27.51% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |

| 2024-09-30 | $-7.45B | -12.21% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-7.95B | -13.28% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, showing considerable negative alpha in recent years, despite periods of positive alpha.  The stock is currently trading below its key moving averages, signaling a bearish trend.  While RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and relative divergence indicate continued bearish momentum.  The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  Furthermore, the negative equity and ROE raise significant questions about the company's financial health and require further investigation.  Before considering investment, a thorough analysis of the underlying reasons for the company's underperformance and financial issues is crucial.  The -77.6% expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon is a very strong indication that this stock is not a desirable investment at this time.
