## Starbucks Corp (SBUX) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is a global coffeehouse chain operating coffeehouses and roastery reserves.  The provided data shows that SBUX's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is -74.3%, placing it at the 14.3rd percentile relative to its historical range of performance against the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance relative to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $90.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $94.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.85

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 26.87 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.41 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +3.4 (Short-term upward trend, but weak considering the other indicators)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -81.6% (This indicates a significant expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. This is a very negative outlook and requires further investigation into the methodology used for this projection).  The closing price of $90.58 doesn't immediately suggest a significant rapid price movement (either up or down), given the context of the other indicators.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (two entries for 2024-07-30).  Focusing only on the unique entries, we can observe the following:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates between $8.56B and $9.43B, not showing a clear consistent upward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS also fluctuates, with no clear trend.  There's a notable dip in Q2 2024 (April 30th).
* **No Expectations Provided:**  The analysis cannot comment on beats or misses because expected earnings are not included in the data.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable but shows some volatility. Profit margins are generally high but show some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative equity throughout the provided period is a significant concern. The return on equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating poor profitability relative to the equity invested. This is a serious red flag.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or market outlook data was provided within the prompt. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also absent.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but also a bearish momentum.  The recent earnings data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS, without a clear upward trend.  Most worryingly, the financial information reveals persistent negative equity and ROE, signaling serious financial challenges for the company. The projected long-term underperformance of -81.6% is exceptionally negative and needs to be viewed with extreme caution due to lack of explanation of the methodology behind this projection.  Further investigation into the causes of negative equity and the methodology for the expected return projection is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current situation presents a high-risk profile.
