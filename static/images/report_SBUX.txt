**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Starbucks Corp is a global coffeehouse chain.  Over the period analyzed, SBUX significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a cumulative return of 69.03% compared to VOO's 119.91%.  The -50.9% difference indicates substantial underperformance. The relative divergence of 30.5% places this underperformance within the context of its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500, showing it is not at its historically worst point, but still considerably lagging.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) data show fluctuating performance over different periods. While some periods exhibited high growth (e.g., 2017-2020), others showed significant negative returns (e.g., 2021-2024).  The alpha values suggest periods of outperformance relative to the market (positive alpha), and periods of underperformance (negative alpha) with high Beta values suggesting higher volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of $107.68 shows a slight decrease from the previous close ($109.00). The price is above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term support. However, the recent negative change (-1.21) indicates a possible short-term correction.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 89.67 suggests the stock is significantly overbought, indicating a potential for a price correction.  The positive PPO (1.66) suggests bullish momentum, but this should be interpreted cautiously in light of the overbought RSI. The 20-day relative divergence change of +11.2% suggests a recent short-term upward trend.  The large negative expected return (-32.8%) for long-term investment relative to the S&P 500 indicates concern for underperformance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue. There is no clear trend visible from the provided data.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers behind the fluctuations.  Note that the 2025-01-28 data point is duplicated.


| Date       | EPS | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | 9.40        |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.93 | 9.11        |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.68 | 8.56        |
| 2024-01-30 | 0.90 | 9.43        |


**5. Financial Information:**

The revenue shows relatively stable performance. Profit margins fluctuated between 24.49% and 27.91%, indicating a healthy profitability but with some variability.  The negative equity and ROE values are concerning, suggesting potential financial distress.   Further investigation into the reasons for negative equity is warranted.

| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin (%) | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31  | 9.40          | 24.49             | -7.47       | -10.45  |
| 2024-09-30  | 9.07          | 26.25             | -7.45       | -12.21  |
| 2024-06-30  | 9.11          | 27.91             | -7.95       | -13.28  |
| 2024-03-31  | 8.56          | 25.58             | -8.45       | -9.14   |
| 2023-12-31  | 9.43          | 27.51             | -8.62       | -11.89  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SBUX has shown significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While short-term indicators suggest some potential upward momentum, the overbought RSI and negative long-term expected return raise concerns.  The negative equity and ROE values from the financial statements are significant red flags and require further investigation to understand their underlying causes.  Before investing in SBUX, a thorough examination of the reasons behind its underperformance and negative equity is crucial.  The seemingly contradictory signals from technical indicators and fundamental analysis necessitate more in-depth research.
