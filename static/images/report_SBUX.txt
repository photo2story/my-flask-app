*   **Cumulative Return Discrepancy:** The large negative deviation (-104.3%) highlights significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The relative deviation of 0.0 indicates it's at the very bottom of its historical range compared to VOO.
*   **CAGR:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates significantly, with negative values in recent periods, indicating inconsistent growth.
*   **MDD:** The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is mostly negative, suggesting that SBUX is underperforming compared to what its beta would predict based on S&P500 returns.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates. A positive beta greater than 1 (e.g., 1.3 in 2023-2025) suggests the stock is more volatile than the market, while negative betas indicate an inverse relationship (although interpretations with such a limited dataset might be misleading).

*   **60-day Moving Average:** 87.3435

*   **Moving Averages:** The current price is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the medium term.

**3) Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 32.73 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.49 (Negative Momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **20-day Relative Deviation Change:** -3.3 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -5136.4% (Significant Underperformance Expected)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment risk suggests a balanced risk-reward profile.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 32.73 indicates that the stock may be approaching oversold conditions, potentially signaling a buying opportunity, but further confirmation is needed.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests that the short-term momentum is weaker than the long-term momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal suggests buying, aligning with an MRI of 0.9, considered Very Safe. However, this contradicts some other indicators.
*   **Relative Deviation:** The negative change in relative deviation indicates a recent decline in performance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. It suggests a long-term expectation of significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if a buy-and-hold strategy is adopted.
*   **Price Change Reaction:** The 'change' value of 2.0 indicates a relatively strong upward movement from the previous close. This might be a short-term reaction and doesn't necessarily change the overall negative outlook.
