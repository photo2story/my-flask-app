| Date       | EPS | Revenue     |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2025-01-28 | 0.69 | $9.40 B     |

This needs to be investigated further to understand the underlying causes.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Starbucks has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While recent years show some positive alpha, the cumulative return remains far behind the market.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend, and the financial statements raise serious concerns about the company's financial health due to negative equity and ROE.  The extremely negative expected return (-83.1%) warrants further investigation to understand its source.  Before considering any investment, thorough due diligence is crucial to assess the risks and potential causes behind the company's underperformance and negative financial metrics.  The current data points toward significant risk and warrants caution.  A long-term investment strategy needs to consider these financial challenges and the possibility of continued underperformance relative to the market.
