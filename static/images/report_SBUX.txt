*   **60-day SMA:** 84.31

**Analysis:** The stock price closed at 86.17 in the last market, down from a previous close of 88.33. All three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day) are relatively close, suggesting a consolidation phase.

*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.43

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 2.5 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -671.0% (Long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk, recommending some allocation.
*   The RSI of 60.62 is nearing overbought territory (typically above 70), indicating the stock may be due for a pullback.
*   The PPO is positive, suggesting a bullish trend, but its magnitude is relatively small, indicating a weak trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests buying, based on a very safe profile (MRI: 0.90).
*   The recent divergence change indicates a short-term upward trend.
*   The significantly negative expected return of -671.0% is a major red flag. It suggests that, based on the model, the stock is significantly overvalued or faces severe headwinds.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**
