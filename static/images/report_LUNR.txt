**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a company developing and deploying commercial lunar landing services.  The company significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period reviewed, with a cumulative return of 73.70% compared to VOO's 9.74%. The relative divergence (64.0) shows LUNR is substantially above its historical range relative to the S&P 500. The provided alpha and beta values indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements, varying significantly between periods.  Note that high beta values (e.g., 2.1 in 2022-2024) suggest greater price swings than the market.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0% | 61.5% | -0.1 | 0.3 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 72.3% | -0.1 | 2.1 |  |
| 2023-2025  | 70.0% | 72.3% | -0.1 | 0.9 |  |

**Analysis:**  The significant fluctuations in CAGR and beta highlight the high risk associated with LUNR. While the recent past shows strong growth, the negative alpha consistently suggests underperformance relative to the market adjusted for risk.  The lack of market capitalization data (Cap(B)) limits a complete assessment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of $7.72 is below both the 20-day ($7.79) and 60-day ($13.99) moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The 5-day moving average ($7.66) is close to the current price, indicating recent price stability.  The recent price change of -1.53% reflects a small decrease from the previous closing price.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI (37.96) is below 50, suggesting the stock is currently in oversold territory.  The PPO (2.85) is positive, indicating upward momentum.  The recent positive change in relative divergence (1.7) suggests a short-term upward trend. However, the high MRI (0.47) signals high market risk.  The projected 28.6% expected return over the long term (2+ years) is significantly higher than the S&P 500's potential return but involves substantial risk, given the volatile nature of the stock.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-03-25 | 0.04 | -0.08 |
| 2024-11-14 | 0.02 | -0.115 |
| 2024-08-13 | -0.05 | -0.14 |
| 2024-05-14 | -0.21 | -0.14 |
| 2024-03-25 | -0.11 | -0.12 |

**Analysis:**  While recent EPS figures show some positive surprises (actual EPS exceeding expectations), the overall trend is volatile and includes significant negative EPS numbers.  Consistent underperformance relative to expectations needs further investigation.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.05B | 1.24% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.06B | 7.05% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.04B | -37.90% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.07B | 16.64% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.03B | 4.79% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $-1.00B | 14.87% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-0.49B | 11.28% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-0.23B | -7.97% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-0.49B | 20.15% |
| 2023-12-31 | $-0.23B | -3.86% |


**Analysis:** Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins fluctuate widely, indicating operational inconsistencies.  Negative equity throughout most of the period is a significant concern and suggests the company is highly leveraged.  ROE shows similar volatility, further highlighting the risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown impressive growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance is accompanied by extremely high volatility and risk.  Negative alpha, highly variable beta, negative equity, and fluctuating profit margins all point to a high-risk, high-reward investment. The positive expected return is tempting, but the potential for substantial losses should not be underestimated.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current price action suggests a potential short-term downward correction, but the long-term outlook depends heavily on the company's ability to execute its business plan and achieve sustained profitability.
