## Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

LUNR, Intuitive Machines Inc., is a developer of robotic systems for space exploration.  The stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **LUNR Cumulative Return:** 58.40%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 7.82%
* **Return Difference:** 50.6% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns at the end of the observed period.  The relative divergence of 16% indicates LUNR's performance is in the higher percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO, but not necessarily 16% better than the S&P 500.)

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent Alpha and Beta values across different periods, suggesting high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The high Beta values (especially 2.2 in 2022-2024) indicate significant market risk.  Negative Alpha values generally imply underperformance relative to the market benchmark after adjusting for risk.  The significant swings in both Alpha and Beta require further investigation and deeper contextual analysis.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.8537

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend. The recent -5.5% daily change suggests a considerable downward movement.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 28.3% (This is a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but needs further justification and underlying assumptions stated.)  The large negative daily price change (-5.5%) warrants caution and might necessitate reassessment of the expected return.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the period reviewed, but this is accompanied by substantial volatility and risk.  The negative equity, inconsistent profitability, and high Beta suggest high risk. While recent earnings show some positive signs, the overall picture is one of significant uncertainty.  The high expected return needs to be carefully considered in light of the financial risk factors.  Further due diligence, including a deeper examination of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future prospects, is strongly recommended before any investment decision.  The current downward price trend and negative daily price change also warrant caution.
