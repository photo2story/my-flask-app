## Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) shows a significantly higher cumulative return than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period. However, its performance has been volatile, exhibiting both substantial gains and losses. While recent earnings show improvement, financial health needs further examination due to negative equity.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of its current performance and future prospects.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) is a developer of lunar landers and space exploration technology.

* **Cumulative Return:** LUNR: 60.21%, VOO: 2.73%
* **Return Difference:** LUNR outperformed VOO by 57.48% at the end of the reviewed period.  The provided relative divergence (16.7%) indicates that this outperformance is relatively high compared to historical variations, but the context is missing regarding the timeline covered by the divergence calculations.
* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different periods.  While significant positive returns were observed, the negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market risk premium in some periods despite the high beta showing the significant volatility.  The fluctuating beta points to high market sensitivity in certain periods.  It's crucial to consider the limitations of analyzing such short time frames.

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0% | 61.5%  | -0.1  | 0.3   |        |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 72.3%  | -0.1  | 2.2   |        |
| 2023-2025  | 57.0%  | 72.3%  | -0.1  | 0.9   |        |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $7.12
* **Last Market Price:** $7.39 (3.79% increase from previous close)  This represents a significant jump.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $14.65

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend, especially considering the significant difference between the current price and the 60-day average. The recent price jump needs further investigation to understand its drivers.



**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)  This suggests elevated risk associated with the stock.
* **RSI:** 50.80 (Neutral; close to the midpoint)  Neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO:** 1.48 (Positive; Suggests bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 30.5% (over S&P 500, long-term). This is a substantial projected return that needs validation with deeper analysis.  The 3.79% price increase is a short-term fluctuation that doesn't necessarily validate long term projection.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-25 | $0.04    | $-0.08         |
| 2024-11-14 | $0.02    | $-0.115        |
| 2024-08-13 | $-0.05   | $-0.14         |
| 2024-05-14 | $-0.21   | $-0.14         |
| 2024-03-25 | $-0.11   | $-0.12         |

Recent earnings show a positive trend, with actual EPS exceeding expectations in the last two quarters, suggesting potential improvement in profitability. However, past performance is not indicative of future results.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.05B    | 1.24%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.06B    | 7.05%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.04B    | -37.90%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.07B    | 16.64%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.03B    | 4.79%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE           |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-1.00B   | 14.87%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $-0.49B   | 11.28%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $-0.23B   | -7.97%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $-0.49B   | 20.15%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $-0.23B   | -3.86%        |

Revenue shows some variability, while profitability is inconsistent. The most concerning aspect is the negative equity throughout the period.  This indicates a high level of risk and requires careful consideration.  The positive ROE in some quarters might be misleading due to the negative equity.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown substantial outperformance against the S&P 500, driven by periods of significant growth, but with considerable volatility reflected in both its price movements and financial statements.  While recent earnings have improved, and the projected long-term return is high, the negative equity and inconsistent profitability are significant red flags.  The high risk indicated by the MRI further underscores the need for caution.  Before making any investment decisions, further in-depth due diligence is critical to assess the sustainability of the current trends and the long-term viability of the company.  The short time frame of the analysis limits the conclusions that can be drawn, and further investigation into the business model, competitive landscape, and management team are crucial.
