**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) is a provider of lunar surface delivery and exploration services.  The company has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods. While VOO saw a 17.82% cumulative return, LUNR achieved a remarkable 106.89% return.  The relative divergence of 89.1 indicates LUNR's performance is considerably higher than the VOO's, placing it in the 21.1% percentile of historical relative performance. However, it's crucial to note that this high divergence is relative to the provided historical data range and does not guarantee future outperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance. While  2022-2024 showed exceptionally high CAGR (177%) and a positive alpha, 2021-2023 indicated a significant negative CAGR (-50%).  The Beta fluctuates, suggesting high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  This inconsistency highlights the significant risk associated with LUNR.  The small market capitalization also contributes to increased volatility.


| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%  | 61.5%  | -0.1  | 0.3   |        |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 72.3%  | -0.1  | 2.1   |        |
| 2023-2025  | 104.0% | 72.3%  | -0.1  | 1.1   |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price action shows LUNR trading slightly below its 60-day moving average ($10.89) and above its 20-day ($7.91) and 5-day ($8.66) moving averages. This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, although it's still below the longer-term average.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 70.26 suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating potential for a short-term correction. The PPO of 3.64 further supports this assessment. The positive 20-day relative divergence change (1.5) suggests a short-term upward trend.  The MRI of 0.3776 classifies the risk as medium, which is consistent with the observed volatility.  The expected return of 19.9% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 is significant but highly dependent on the continued success and growth of the company in a volatile market.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a history of negative EPS, with recent quarters showing improvement toward profitability.  However, consistently missing earnings expectations highlights the company's challenges in achieving profitability. The trend toward positive EPS is promising, but substantial uncertainty remains.

| 날짜       | EPS    | 예상 EPS |

| 2025-03-25 | 0.04   | -0.08    |

**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis. This absence of crucial financial metrics makes a thorough assessment impossible.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown impressive returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this performance is coupled with high volatility and inconsistent earnings. The lack of key financial data hinders a complete assessment.  While the projected long-term expected return is attractive, the high risk, overbought conditions (RSI), and the absence of crucial financial information should be carefully considered.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in LUNR. The high volatility and potential for significant corrections warrant a conservative approach, potentially involving diversification and careful risk management.
