**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

LUNR (Intuitive Machines Inc.) is a developer of lunar robotic landing systems and related technologies.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with substantial volatility.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (LUNR):** 70.22%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 10.08%
* **Return Difference:** 60.14% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns between LUNR and VOO as of the last data point.  The relative divergence of 17.2% indicates that LUNR's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to VOO)


The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance and high volatility:

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%  | 61.5%   | -0.1  | 0.3   |       |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 72.3%   | -0.1  | 2.1   |       |
| 2023-2025  | 67.0%   | 72.3%   | -0.1  | 0.9   |       |

The negative alpha suggests LUNR has underperformed the market after adjusting for risk (Beta).  However, the high and fluctuating beta indicates significant sensitivity to market movements.  The large swings in CAGR highlight the substantial risk associated with this investment.

* **Closing Price:** $7.57
* **Previous Close:** $7.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $13.36

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price drop of -2.89% is notable.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.68 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)

* **Expected Return:** 25.9% (Long-term (2+ years) expected excess return over S&P 500)

The recent price drop (-2.89%) significantly contributed to the negative short-term relative divergence.  The positive PPO, while showing momentum, should be interpreted cautiously considering the recent price decline and the overall market risk. The high expected return needs to be considered in the context of high risk and volatility.
