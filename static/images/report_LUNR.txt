**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a company developing and deploying lunar landers and other space technologies.  LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return exceeding the S&P 500 by 158.4 percentage points. The relative divergence metric highlights this significant outperformance relative to its historical performance against the VOO.  However, this high return should be viewed in the context of the high volatility indicated by the CAGR and MDD figures below.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -67.0% | 44.7%  | -0.2  | 0.2   |        |
| 2022-2024  | 180.0% | 44.7%  | -0.0  | 1.7   |        |
| 2023-2025  | 185.0% | 44.7%  | 0.0   | 1.8   |        |


The highly variable CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and beta values suggest significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements. The negative alpha values in some periods suggest underperformance relative to the market, while the positive alpha in the final period shows a period of outperformance.  The missing Cap(B) (market capitalization in billions) data prevents a full interpretation of the relationship between size and risk/return.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $19.39
* **Last Market Price:** $19.17
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $20.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $16.31

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend.  The 60-day moving average is significantly lower, indicating a longer-term upward trend despite the recent pullback.  The price decrease from the previous close reflects recent market movements.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 51.16 (Slightly above neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -2.44 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.0% (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return:** 38.9% (Long-term expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests a neutral position, the negative PPO and the negative relative divergence indicate a short-term bearish trend. However, the high expected return suggests potential for long-term growth.  The recent price drop of approximately -1.14% needs to be considered in the broader context of the recent trend. Itâ€™s not a significant drop in itself, but the fact it is below the moving averages is a stronger indication of a trend change.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-08-13 | -0.05   | -0.14         |
| 2024-05-14 | -0.21   | -0.14         |
| 2024-03-25 | -0.11   | -0.12         |
| 2023-11-13 | -0.22   | -0.12         |
| 2023-08-14 | 0.35    | -0.24         |

Earnings have been largely negative recently, although several quarters have shown positive surprises (actual EPS exceeding expected EPS). The significant positive surprise in 2023-08-14 should be further investigated.  The recent negative EPS figures require further analysis to determine the underlying causes.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.06B     | 7.05%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.04B     | -37.90%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.07B     | 16.64%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.03B     | 4.79%         |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.01B     | -108.10%      |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE          |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $-0.49B    | 11.28%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $-0.23B    | -7.97%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $-0.49B    | 20.15%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $-0.24B    | -3.83%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $-0.35B    | -9.62%        |

Revenue shows some growth but is still low.  Profitability is volatile, with significant negative margins in several quarters.  Negative equity throughout the period suggests the company may be heavily reliant on external funding.  ROE (Return on Equity) is highly variable, reflecting the overall volatile financial picture.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown remarkable outperformance against the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility.  The recent price decline and mixed technical indicators suggest caution.  While the high expected return and the positive earnings surprise of Aug 2023 are encouraging signs for long-term investors, the negative earnings trend, volatile profitability, and negative equity warrant a thorough investigation into the company's financials and future prospects before making any investment decisions.  Further research into the reasons behind the dramatic volatility, the large negative equity, and the variability of both revenue and profitability is crucial.  The long-term potential is apparent, but the risks are considerable.
