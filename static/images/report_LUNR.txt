## Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) Stock Review

This report analyzes Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR), a company developing and deploying lunar landers and related technologies for space exploration.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

LUNR's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **LUNR Cumulative Return:** 93.05%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 14.92%
* **Return Difference:** 78.1%
* **Relative Divergence:** 19.6% (This indicates LUNR's performance is in the upper 20th percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO, not necessarily 20% better).

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures show high volatility and inconsistent performance across different time periods.  The negative alpha values across all periods suggest that LUNR has underperformed the market after accounting for its beta (systematic risk). The beta, however, is highly variable, suggesting significant shifts in the relationship between LUNR's returns and the overall market.  The relatively small market capitalization (Cap(B)) adds to the risk profile.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0% | 61.5% | -66.0% | 0.3 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 72.3% | 151.0% | 2.1 |  |
| 2023-2025  | 90.0% | 72.3% | 76.0% | 1.0 |  |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $8.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $11.95

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downtrend. The recent price change of 2.39% (from $8.38 to $8.58) shows a minor upward movement.  This is not considered a sharp increase or decrease.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 68.87 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 3.46 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 21.9% (Long-term, 2+ years, excess return over S&P 500)

The RSI is approaching overbought levels, suggesting a potential correction could be imminent.  However, the positive PPO and relative divergence indicate continued upward momentum in the short term. The high expected return warrants consideration, but this should be viewed cautiously considering the high volatility of the stock.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS |

| 2024-03-25 | -0.11   | -0.12         |


The recent earnings show a mixed picture, with some positive surprises (March 2025, November 2024) and significant misses.  Consistent profitability remains elusive, highlighting the company's developmental stage and inherent risks.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2024-12-31 | $0.05B   | 1.24%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.06B   | 7.05%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.04B   | -37.90%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.07B   | 16.64%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.03B   | 4.79%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| 2024-09-30 | $-0.49B  | 11.28%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $-0.23B  | -7.97%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $-0.49B  | 20.15%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $-0.23B  | -3.86%  |

Revenue shows some growth, but profit margins are highly volatile, indicating operational challenges.  The negative equity suggests the company is heavily reliant on funding. ROE is similarly volatile, reflecting the company’s risky profile.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

LUNR exhibits exceptionally high growth potential but is associated with significant risk.  The stock's performance has drastically outpaced the S&P 500 in the past, but its volatility and inconsistent profitability raise serious concerns.  The high expected return should be considered in light of the considerable risk involved.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company’s business model, competitive landscape, and management team, is crucial before any investment decision.  Investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term horizon might consider a small allocation to LUNR as part of a well-diversified portfolio.  However, those seeking stability should avoid this stock.
