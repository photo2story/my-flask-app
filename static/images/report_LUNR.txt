2025-12-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) based on the data provided.

**LUNR: Intuitive Machines Inc. Company Overview:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a space exploration and services company focused on lunar missions and related technologies.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (LUNR vs. S&P 500 (VOO))**

*   **LUNR Cumulative Return:** 147.10%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 34.78%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 109.9
    *   Relative Divergence: 22.1 (This indicates the current divergence is in the lower quartile of its historical range, suggesting it is closer to its minimum divergence than its maximum.)

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%   | 83.4% | -43.0%   | 0.1  | 0.3   |
| 2022-2024  | 186.0%  | 83.4% | 165.0%  | 0.1  | 2.2   |
| 2023-2025  | 144.0%  | 83.4% | 79.0%   | 0.0  | 1.1   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows a strong positive growth rate from 2022-2025, but the period from 2021-2023 showed negative growth, reflecting the volatility of a relatively new and speculative stock.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The consistently high MDD of 83.4% demonstrates a high degree of risk and price volatility in LUNR.  Investors should expect significant price swings.
*   **Alpha:** The consistently positive Alpha values (especially in 2022-2024) indicate LUNR has outperformed its expected return based on its beta, implying good stock selection or market timing.
*   **Beta:**  The very low Beta values suggest LUNR's price movements are not strongly correlated with the broader market (S&P 500). It behaves independently, which can be a double-edged sword.  Low Beta may be misleading because the company does rely on government contracts, and the S&P 500 is subject to that as well.
*   **Cap(B):** Increasing market capitalization is shown over time, increasing dramatically during the 2022-2024 period, indicating increasing investor confidence and capital investment in the company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 9.655
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 9.64, Previous Close: 9.42, Change: 2.34
*   **5-day SMA:** 9.462
*   **20-day SMA:** 9.3362
*   **60-day SMA:** 10.499

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is above both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting short-term positive momentum.  However, it's below the 60-day SMA, which could indicate potential resistance at that level or that the longer-term trend is less bullish.
*   The recent increase of 2.34 suggests a recent positive price movement.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 51.80 (Neutral - Neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 1.19 (Positive - Suggests short-term price strength relative to longer-term prices, indicative of an upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (105 shares - Very Safe) with a monthly investment plan (MRI: 0.9)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** 4.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 116.6%

**Analysis:**

*   An MRI of 0.9 indicates the model considers the stock suitable for investment despite its high volatility. This is probably due to the recent strong performance combined with the low Beta.
*   An RSI around 50 indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The positive PPO supports the conclusion of the recent Relative Divergence change indicating a short-term upward trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal indicates a strong buy recommendation, likely based on the MRI and the expected future growth.
*   A 116.6% expected return is very high, suggesting significant potential upside. However, such high returns are typically associated with higher risk.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Sentiment:**  Articles highlighting potential stock increases due to government work ("These two space stocks could rise 70%"), contract wins ("Evaluating Intuitive Machines After Lunar Contract Wins"), and the potential for long-term gains ("Could Buying Intuitive Machines Stock Today Set You Up for Life?") create positive sentiment.
*   **Mixed Sentiment:**  Articles mentioning lowered expectations from analysts ("Canaccord Genuity Group Has Lowered Expectations") and an expected decline in earnings ("Earnings Preview: Intuitive Machines, Inc. (LUNR) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline") present a mixed outlook.
*   **Neutral/Minor Negative:**  An article stating the stock is down 3% ("$LUNR stock is down 3% today") is a minor negative, but the article's source (Quiver Quantitative) might offer further data-driven insights.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (1.38 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Opinions:** 8 analysts
*   **Target Price:** Average: $15.50, High: $18.00, Low: $9.50
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  No recent rating changes.

**Analysis:**

*   The strong buy consensus and the significant gap between the current price and the average target price ($9.65 vs. $15.50) suggest that analysts see considerable upside potential.  However, note the wide range in target prices, which underscores the uncertainty surrounding the stock.
*   No recent rating changes indicate a stable outlook (at least in the short term).

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Intuitive Machines (LUNR) is a high-growth, high-risk stock with significant upside potential, as indicated by its strong recent performance, analyst ratings, and a high expected return. The company's stock price is currently trending upwards, supported by positive news regarding government contracts and lunar mission successes. The company's independence from the S&P 500 (low beta) and high alpha indicate the company is doing well independent of larger market forces.

However, investors should be aware of the stock's high volatility (high MDD), the mixed news sentiment (lowered expectations and potential earnings decline), and the potential risks inherent in a relatively new space exploration company. The divergence indicates that the current growth rate has not caught up to the historical growth rate, which could represent a buying opportunity or a sign of future stagnation.

**Investment Recommendation:**

*   **Aggressive Investors:** LUNR may be suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. The positive analyst ratings and expected returns suggest significant upside potential. The hybrid signal is a buy for those looking for a 'very safe' pick.
*   **Conservative Investors:** LUNR is likely too risky for conservative investors. The high volatility and potential for significant drawdowns make it unsuitable for those seeking stable returns.
*   **Due Diligence:**  Regardless of risk tolerance, thorough due diligence is crucial before investing in LUNR. Investors should carefully consider the company's financial performance, competitive landscape, and the inherent risks associated with the space exploration industry. Investors should also consider the divergence in growth and ensure that the company is able to recover to the historical growth levels.
