**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a company developing and deploying commercial lunar landers.  The provided data shows LUNR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return difference is a substantial 55.4%, placing the current outperformance at the 16.6th percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500. However,  the Alpha values suggest underperformance relative to the market risk (negative alpha).  The Beta values are volatile, implying high sensitivity to market movements.


**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0% | 61.5%  | -0.1  | 0.3   |        |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 72.3%  | -0.1  | 2.1   |        |
| 2023-2025  | 62.0%  | 72.3%  | -0.1  | 0.9   |        |

**Analysis:**  High volatility in CAGR and Beta across the periods indicates significant risk.  The consistently negative alpha suggests that LUNR's returns have not exceeded what would be expected given its market risk.  The substantial positive CAGR in 2022-2024 needs to be considered in context of the overall volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $7.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.60

**Analysis:** The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average highlights a recent decline.  The recent price change of 4.55% indicates a slight upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 49.01 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.93 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum, but needs further context)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.9 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 27.0% (This represents a projected excess return over the S&P 500 with long-term investment.)
* **Price Change:** The 4.55% increase might signal a short-term bounce, requiring further observation to confirm a trend reversal.

**Analysis:** The indicators present a mixed picture.  While the PPO suggests positive momentum, the RSI is neutral, and the relative divergence change signals a short-term bearish trend. The expected return is positive and significant, but this is based on a specific model and future performance is not guaranteed. The MRI suggests moderate risk.

| 2024-03-25 | -0.11   | -0.12         |

**Analysis:**  There's a pattern of positive EPS surprises, exceeding the expected negative EPS in several quarters. However, the negative EPS figures overall indicate ongoing financial challenges.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the EPS surprises is crucial.

**Analysis:** Revenue is fluctuating. Profit margins are highly variable, with significant losses in Q2 2024. Negative equity throughout the period raises serious concerns about the company's financial stability.  ROE also shows considerable volatility.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown a remarkable outperformance compared to the S&P 500, yet this is coupled with high volatility and negative alpha, suggesting the outperformance might not be entirely sustainable.  The company faces significant financial challenges indicated by negative equity and fluctuating profit margins. While recent earnings have shown positive surprises, the overall picture indicates a high-risk, high-reward investment.  The positive long-term expected return is promising, but potential investors should carefully assess the inherent risks associated with this company's financial situation and volatile market behavior.  Further due diligence and thorough risk assessment are absolutely necessary before any investment decision.
