|------------|--------|-------|---------|------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 279.0% | 83.4% | 214.0%  | 0.0  | 1.8    |

*   **CAGR:** Shows significant growth potential (186% - 279% for more recent periods) but also a period of sharp decline (-50%).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high (83.4%), indicating high volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** The high Alpha values (165% - 214% for more recent periods) suggests that LUNR has significantly outperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. This indicates skilled management or inherent business advantages.
*   **Beta:** The low Beta values (0.1 - 0.0) suggests that LUNR is much less volatile than the market as a whole and therefore not tightly correlated with the market (S&P 500). This is contrary to the volatility indicated by MDD.

*   **60-day SMA:** \$10.98

**Analysis:**

The price jump of 37.7% is a very significant short-term fluctuation. The moving averages confirm a strong recent upward trend. However, such a large one-day move could indicate increased risk and volatility.

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** +11.1 (Short-Term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 47.0%

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI in overbought territory suggests the stock *may* be due for a correction, but momentum can sustain it for a while.
