## Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

LUNR, Intuitive Machines Inc., is a company developing and deploying commercial lunar landing services.  The provided data shows significant volatility and outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO) in certain periods, but also considerable risk.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (LUNR):** 97.65%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 17.92%
* **Return Difference:** 79.7% (This represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, the relative divergence of 17.2% indicates this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical range.)

The alpha/beta analysis shows inconsistent performance:

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) | Notes                               |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|--------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| 2021-2023  | -67.0%   | 44.7%   | -62.0%  | 0.2    |        | Significant negative returns and high MDD |
| 2022-2024  | 180.0%  | 44.7%   | 147.0%  | 1.7    |        | Extremely high return, but still high MDD |
| 2023-2025  | 94.0%    | 44.7%   | 44.0%   | 1.2    |        | High return, but high MDD persists      |


High Beta values (1.7 and 1.2) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The inconsistent Alpha suggests unpredictable returns independent of market movements. The company's performance is highly volatile and not consistently predictable.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $14.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $17.85
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $17.60

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 30.21 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce back but not a definitive buy signal.)
* **PPO:** -4.02 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.8 (Short-term bearish divergence.)
* **Expected Return:** 63.8% (A high expected return, but this must be viewed cautiously due to the significant risk associated with the stock's volatility.)  This potential return must be contextualized against the high risk as evidenced by the other indicators and financial statements.
* **Price Change:** A small positive price change (+$0.01) doesn't significantly alter the overall bearish sentiment.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE          | Notes                                        |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $-0.49B     | 11.28%        | Negative equity, but positive ROE              |
| 2024-06-30  | $-0.23B     | -7.97%        | Negative equity and negative ROE                |
| 2024-03-31  | $-0.49B     | 20.15%        | Negative equity, but positive ROE               |
| 2023-12-31  | $-0.24B     | -3.83%        | Negative equity and negative ROE                |
| 2023-09-30  | $-0.35B     | -9.62%        | Negative equity and negative ROE                |

Negative equity throughout the period is a major concern, indicating significant financial risk.  While ROE is sometimes positive, it's highly volatile and unreliable.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

LUNR shows significant potential for high returns, as evidenced by its substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in certain periods and its high projected future returns. However, this potential is coupled with extremely high risk.  The company's financials reveal negative equity, inconsistent earnings, highly volatile profitability, and a highly volatile stock price (high beta).  The high projected return should be viewed with extreme caution given these risks.  Investing in LUNR requires a high-risk tolerance and a long-term perspective, even with the potential for significant returns.  Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing.  Further in-depth due diligence is recommended.
