2025-12-28 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) based on the provided data:

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Intuitive Machines Inc is a space exploration, infrastructure, and services company.
*   **LUNR Cumulative Return:** 290.29%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 37.41%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 247.3
    *   Relative Divergence: 42.2

**Analysis:** LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. However, the "Relative Divergence" of 42.2 indicates that while the difference is large, the current divergence level sits only in the lower portion of the historical band of divergence. This suggests that while LUNR's outperformance is substantial, it could still potentially rise significantly higher relative to its past performance.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ---- | ------ |
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%  | 83.4% | -43.0%  | 0.1  | 0.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 186.0% | 83.4% | 165.0% | 0.1  | 2.2    |
| 2023-2025  | 287.0% | 83.4% | 219.0% | 0.0  | 1.8    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Demonstrates impressive growth in recent periods (2022-2025, 2023-2025) after a period of decline.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk. Investors should be prepared for potentially large drops in value.
*   **Alpha:**  High positive Alpha values (especially in recent periods) show that LUNR is generating returns above what would be expected based on market movements alone.  This suggests strong stock-picking ability or exposure to unique factors.
*   **Beta:**  Low Beta values (close to 0) imply LUNR's price is not very correlated with the broader market (S&P 500). This can offer diversification benefits but also means LUNR's performance is driven by company-specific factors.
*   **Cap:** This is capitalization expressed in Billions of USD.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 15.25
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 15.25

    *   Change: -8.74
*   **5-day SMA:** 16.02
*   **20-day SMA:** 12.207
*   **60-day SMA:** 11.3802

**Analysis:**  The stock price has recently decreased significantly as indicated by the negative change, with price dropping below all the simple moving averages. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting that while a recent drop occurred, it still shows short-term positive momentum, however the current price sits below all averages.  Investors should carefully examine why the stock fell significantly on the last day.

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 66.83 (Approaching overbought territory, but not yet definitively overbought)
*   **PPO:** 4.15 (Positive, indicating upward momentum, but not extreme)

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 11.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return:** 47.0% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The high MRI score is an encouraging signal for the stock, suggesting that the stock, based on the indicators used in the MRI, is sound for investment.
*   **RSI and PPO:** Indicate positive momentum but don't suggest extreme overbought conditions.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Very Safe" recommendation combined with the MRI is a bullish indicator, encouraging a full investment of available cash with a consistent dollar-cost averaging approach.
*   **Expected Return:** A 47% expected return (over the S&P 500 over 2 years) is very high and should be considered with caution, especially given the company's volatility.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative:**
    *   SVP Crain sells $5.3m in LUNR stock (Insider selling can be perceived negatively).

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (1.33) based on 9 opinions.
*   **Target Price:** Average of $16.67, High of $20.00, Low of $9.50.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is strongly positive, with a "Strong Buy" rating. The target price suggests potential upside from the current price of $15.25, but the wide range between the high and low targets reflects the uncertainty surrounding the stock. The recent news of strong analyst sentiment is a positive signal, but potential investors should also take into account the fact that an SVP of the company recently sold a large number of shares.

Intuitive Machines (LUNR) presents a mixed picture. On one hand:

*   **Strong Performance:** It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 with a substantial cumulative return and high Alpha.
*   **Positive Analyst Sentiment:** Analyst ratings are very positive with significant upside, but the spread is very wide.
*   **Technical Indicators:** MRI indicates high investment recommendation and Hybrid Signal suggests an allocation into LUNR.

On the other hand:

*   **High Volatility:**  MDD is high, and the stock price has recently experienced a significant drop.
*   **Risk Factors:** Negative market sentiment due to recent stock performance and the news of an SVP of the company selling shares.
*   **Dependence on News:**  The stock's performance is clearly sensitive to news events, both positive (analyst upgrades, contract wins) and negative (insider selling, mission setbacks).
*   **Uncertainty:** While analyst target prices suggest upside, the large range highlights the uncertainty in valuing a company in the space exploration sector.

**Conclusion:**

LUNR is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The company shows enormous potential based on its Alpha, recent performance and analyst opinions, however it also comes with a high level of uncertainty due to volatility and the company's recent stock decline. Investors should carefully weigh their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in LUNR. In the short-term the 5-day SMA indicates the positive momentum, however the news of the stock price decline may reverse the momentum. In the long-term the hybrid signal and analyst consensus indicate the stock is a buy.
