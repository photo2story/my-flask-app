* **Cumulative Return (LUNR):** 43.93%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 6.44%

**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a provider of lunar surface access and delivery services.  LUNR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, with a cumulative return of 43.93% compared to VOO's 6.44%.  The difference is substantial, though the relative divergence suggests this outperformance is not unprecedented based on historical data.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show significant volatility in performance metrics across the different time periods.  High beta values (2.1 in 2022-2024) indicate higher sensitivity to market movements than the S&P 500.  Conversely, a beta of 0.3 (2021-2023) shows less sensitivity.  Alpha values vary, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to market benchmarks.  The market capitalization is not consistently reported.


| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| 2021-2023  | -57.0%   | 68.6%   | -49.0% | 1.6    |         |
| 2022-2024  | 101.0%  | 89.0%   | 79.0%  | 2.1    |         |
| 2023-2025  | 44.0%   | 89.0%   | 3.0%   | 0.9    |         |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $7.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $8.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $8.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.52

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The significant difference between the short-term (5 & 20-day) and the 60-day moving average indicates a recent substantial price drop.  The small positive daily change (`{'price': 7.47, 'previousClose': 7.45, 'change': 0.27}`) does not indicate a significant reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.53 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.35 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.77 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 87.0% (Significant outperformance relative to S&P 500 anticipated)


The high MRI indicates significant risk associated with the stock.  While the PPO suggests bullish momentum, the negative relative divergence change and the price being below moving averages suggest caution.  The projected 87% return is a significant forecast, demanding further investigation to determine its reliability.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has shown inconsistent earnings, with both positive and negative EPS figures.  Importantly, actual EPS consistently beats the estimated EPS, suggesting possible positive surprises in the future. However, the recent trend shows declining revenue and fluctuating profitability.

| 2025-03-25 | 0.04     | -0.08         |

| 2024-03-25 | -0.11    | -0.12         |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has fluctuated, and profitability (profit margin) shows significant inconsistency across quarters, indicating operational challenges.  Equity has also been largely negative, pointing to financial fragility. The ROE (Return on Equity) is also highly volatile, reflecting the overall instability of the company's financial performance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown periods of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this performance is accompanied by considerable volatility and risk, as highlighted by the high beta, inconsistent earnings, and fluctuating financial metrics. The high MRI and negative relative divergence indicators suggest caution. While the high projected return is tempting, the underlying financial instability of Intuitive Machines requires further scrutiny before any investment decision is made.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with this stock and conduct thorough due diligence before investing.  The large negative equity figure is particularly concerning.
