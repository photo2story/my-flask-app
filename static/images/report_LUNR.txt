Okay, here's an English report analyzing the provided data for Intuitive Machines Inc (LUNR).

**Report: Intuitive Machines Inc (LUNR) Analysis**

**Company Overview:** Intuitive Machines Inc. is a space exploration, infrastructure, and services company focused on lunar missions.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **LUNR Cumulative Return:** 119.51%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 38.78%
*   **Absolute Spread:** 80.73%
*   **Historical Spread Range:** Max: 683.3, Min: -62.6
*   **Relative Spread Position:** 19.2

**Analysis:** LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  However, the 'Relative Spread Position' of 19.2 indicates that the current outperformance, while substantial, is relatively low compared to the extreme historical highs of outperformance. This suggests that, while LUNR is doing well compared to the S&P 500, its current performance is not exceptional compared to its own historical volatility.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%  | 61.5% | -60.0%  | -0.0  | 0.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0%  | 72.3% | 147.0%  | -0.0  | 2.1    |
| 2023-2025  | 116.0%  | 72.3% | 71.0%   | 0.1   | 1.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant volatility. The negative CAGR for 2021-2023 is concerning, but the dramatic increases in subsequent periods (177% and 116%) indicate potential for high growth, albeit with high risk.
*   **MDD:**  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is high across all periods, indicating substantial downside risk.  This is typical for growth stocks, particularly in the space exploration sector.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are very high (especially 2022-2024), suggesting that LUNR's returns are largely independent of market movements. The negative alpha for 2021-2023 is not good.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to zero suggest very low correlation with the S&P 500. This implies LUNR's price movements are driven more by company-specific factors than overall market trends.

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 9.533
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 10.6228

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** -0.2 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 46.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI indicates low to medium risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 30, indicating an oversold condition, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity *if* other factors support a reversal.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests a bearish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggest a very conservative allocation, due to the low MRI index.
*   **20-day spread change:** The negative spread confirms recent underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return suggests significant upside potential from current levels over a long-term (2+ year) investment horizon.  However, this should be viewed with caution given the company's volatility.

Intuitive Machines (LUNR) presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.

**Key Positives:**

*   Negative equity and volatile profit margins, raising solvency concerns.
*   Recent negative price momentum.
*   Recent EPS misses.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the significant risks, especially the negative equity and inconsistent revenue, a conservative approach is warranted. If considering an investment, it should be a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, with a long-term (2+ year) investment horizon. Close monitoring of company news, financial reports, and industry developments is crucial. The hybrid signal is very conservative, and reflects the situation very well.
