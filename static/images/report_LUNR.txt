## Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) shows significant outperformance against the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period, with substantially higher cumulative returns. However,  volatility and inconsistent financial performance raise concerns.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of its growth.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) is a company developing and deploying lunar landers and related space technologies.

* **Cumulative Return Comparison:**  LUNR achieved a cumulative return of 93.5%, significantly outperforming VOO's 15.7%. The difference is substantial, with a relative divergence placing LUNR in the upper 90th percentile of its historical range against VOO.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows inconsistent performance metrics.  While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of significant growth (177% in 2022-2024),  it also reflects periods of substantial losses (-50% in 2021-2023). The Beta fluctuates considerably, suggesting high sensitivity to market movements.  A negative alpha consistently indicates underperformance relative to the market after adjusting for beta.  The market capitalization (Cap) is not consistently reported.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0% | 61.5% | -66.0% | 0.3 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 72.3% | 151.0% | 2.1 |  |
| 2023-2025  | 90.0% | 72.3% | 75.0% | 1.0 |  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $8.60
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $8.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $11.51

The price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent price increase from $8.57 to $8.60 (0.35 change) is a relatively small positive move and doesn't signify a significant rebound.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Low Risk) suggests relatively low market volatility.
* **RSI:** 66.07 (Approaching overbought territory).
* **PPO:** 3.72 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum).
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +3.0 (Short-term upward trend).
* **Expected Return:** 21.9% (2+ year horizon), a substantial premium over the S&P 500.

The relatively small recent price change doesn't significantly alter the interpretation of the technical indicators.  The high expected return needs to be viewed in the context of the inherent risk associated with LUNR's high volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has experienced significant losses in recent quarters, although there are signs of improvement towards profitability.  The positive EPS in the last two quarters, compared to the negative expectations, is a positive sign. However,  the overall profitability remains inconsistent.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR demonstrates substantial outperformance against the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative returns.  However, this is accompanied by significant volatility and inconsistency in financial performance metrics, including earnings, revenue, and profit margins.  The high Beta suggests susceptibility to market downturns.  While the expected return is attractive, the risk associated with the company's fluctuating performance and negative equity warrants careful consideration.  Investors should thoroughly assess the company's long-term growth prospects and risk tolerance before investing.  Further investigation into the causes of the inconsistent financial performance is crucial before drawing definitive conclusions.
