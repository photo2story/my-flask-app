This report analyzes Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR), a company developing and deploying lunar landing and surface transportation systems.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

LUNR's cumulative return (28.69%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (17.55%) by 11.1 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 8.9% indicates that LUNR's performance is positioned in the higher range compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. However, this relative strength is not consistently reflected in the alpha/beta analysis.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                      |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|-------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2021-2023  | -67.0%  | 44.7%  | -0.62% | 0.2   |        | Significant negative return and low beta     |

The high volatility and inconsistent performance shown by the CAGR and Alpha/Beta highlight significant risk. While recent performance has been strong, historical data suggests substantial risk associated with this stock.  The lack of market capitalization data further limits a full interpretation.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $16.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $17.55

The current price is significantly below all moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent sharp drop warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 16.72 (Suggests oversold conditions, but should be interpreted cautiously given the context of the price drop.)
* **PPO:** -5.57 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.7% (Indicates a recent decline in relative strength.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 137.5% (This is a projected excess return over the S&P 500,  significantly high and requires careful consideration.  The high volatility of the company necessitates a deeper look into the basis for this projection.)
* **Recent Price Change:** The substantial price drop (-22.11%) suggests a significant negative event impacted the stock price. Further investigation is necessary to understand this decline.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

LUNR shows significant potential with its strong recent relative performance and a positive long-term expected return. However, considerable risk is present. The companyâ€™s high volatility, negative equity, inconsistent earnings, and recent sharp price drop require careful consideration.  Investors need to thoroughly research the reasons for the recent price drop and the basis for the projected high return before making any investment decisions.  The relatively low revenue and inconsistent profitability are also significant concerns.  Further investigation into the company's financial health and future prospects is crucial.  This report should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy or sell.
