**Executive Summary:**

LUNR, Intuitive Machines Inc, is focused on space exploration, offering lunar access services and technologies.  It has demonstrated high volatility and currently faces mixed market signals.  The stock exhibits significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over certain periods but also carries substantial risk.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **Cumulative Return (LUNR):** 115.31%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 29.99%
*   **Spread:** 85.3
*   **Relative Spread Position:** 17.7

*Analysis:* LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 based on cumulative returns. However, the "Relative Spread Position" suggests the current outperformance is relatively low compared to its historical range, indicating potential for further volatility.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%  | 61.5%  | -50.0%  | 0.2  | 0.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0%  | 72.3%  | 152.0%  | 0.1  | 2.1    |
| 2023-2025  | 112.0%  | 72.3%  | 59.0%   | 0.0  | 1.0    |

*Analysis:* The data shows a highly variable performance. The large MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values signal significant risk. Alpha is very high, but Beta is low. This suggests LUNR's returns are less correlated with the overall market (S&P 500) and may be driven by company-specific factors or sector sentiment. The company's cap decreased during 2021-2023.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 31.91 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.0977

*   **20-Day Relative Spread Change:** -0.5 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 119.8%

*Analysis:* The RSI indicates that the stock may be oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity. The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is negative, confirming the downtrend.  The Hybrid Signal is very cautious, advising a high cash position. The 20-day relative spread change confirms a recent negative trend compared to the S&P 500. A remarkable expected return of 119.8% indicates substantial upside potential, however, it should be regarded cautiously due to the company's volatile historical performance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR is a high-risk, high-reward stock. It has shown significant outperformance potential, but its financials are precarious.

*   **Positives:** High potential returns (as suggested by the significant positive alpha and the analyst target prices), oversold conditions (RSI), and positive analyst ratings.
*   **Negatives:** Recent downtrend, inconsistent revenue, negative equity, negative profit margins, the need for convertible note offerings, and high volatility.

**Recommendation:**

Due to the volatile nature of the stock, high risk, and inconsistent financials, this stock is not recommended for risk-averse investors. It should be considered only by investors with a high-risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the space exploration industry. A close watch should be kept on the \$300 Million Convertible Note Offering.
