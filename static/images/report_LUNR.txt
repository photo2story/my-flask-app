Recent news suggests volatility due to business developments and regulatory changes. The hybrid signal suggests a cautious approach.

**Recommendation:**

Given the high volatility, mixed earnings results, and negative equity, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should closely monitor news and company announcements, particularly regarding financial performance and regulatory developments. The high expected return is attractive, but it should be weighed against the significant risks. The hybrid signal's recommendation to hold a high cash position and reduce holdings seems prudent at this time.
