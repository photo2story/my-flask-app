*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals interesting trends over the past few years.
    *   **2021-2023:**  Negative CAGR (-50%) and significant MDD (83.4%) indicate a challenging period. The negative Alpha (-43%) suggests underperformance relative to its benchmark, while the low Beta (0.1) indicates low volatility compared to the market. The small Cap(B) (0.3B) reflect the company's modest size and market capitalization.
    *   **2022-2024:**  Strong turnaround with a high CAGR (186%) and a substantial positive Alpha (165%) demonstrating significant outperformance.  A low Beta (0.1) continues to indicate low volatility. Capitalization increased significantly (2.2B).
    *   **2023-2025:**  Continued positive momentum with a high CAGR (279%) and Alpha (214%). Beta remains low (0.0), suggesting minimal correlation with the market. Capitalization remains high (1.8B).
*   **Overall:** The Alpha/Beta analysis suggests that LUNR's performance has been largely independent of the broader market (low Beta) and driven by company-specific factors, leading to periods of significant outperformance.
