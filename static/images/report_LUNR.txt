*   **Expected Return:** 116.6% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)
    *   *Interpretation:* The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is neutral. The PPO and the recent positive change in relative divergence suggest short-term upward momentum. The hybrid signal is strongly bullish.
