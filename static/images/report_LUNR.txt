*   **Downsides:** Extremely high volatility (as indicated by the large MDD). Low Beta means LUNR does not behave like the wider market and can be considered unpredictable.  Small market cap can lead to greater price swings.  Neutral to negative signals from technical indicators like RSI and recent price action. Relative Divergence is toward the bottom range.
*   **Recommendation:** The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a buy-and-hold strategy with consistent reinvestment. However, given the volatility, potential investors should proceed with caution and size their positions accordingly. The expected return is substantial, but only achievable with a long-term (>2 years) investment horizon and a tolerance for significant price fluctuations. Be sure to perform due diligence.
