**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year        | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Shows substantial volatility.  The negative CAGR in the 2021-2023 period contrasts sharply with the very high CAGRs in subsequent periods.  This highlights the high-growth, high-risk nature of the stock.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses. Investors need to be aware of this volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The positive alpha figures in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods demonstrate the stock has generated returns above what would be expected based on its beta, suggesting successful active management or unique market positioning. However, negative alpha in 2021-2023 indicates underperformance relative to its risk.
*   **Beta:**  The beta values are close to zero/negative, suggesting low correlation with the market. The low beta indicates LUNR's price movements are relatively independent of the broader market.
*   **Cap:** This illustrates the market capitalization of the firm at the time of year in the table.
