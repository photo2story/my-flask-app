**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a provider of lunar landing services.  Over the period analyzed, LUNR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), boasting a cumulative return of 201.02% compared to VOO's 31.41%.  While the high relative divergence suggests a strong performance compared to its historical range against VOO, it's crucial to note that this is relative and doesn't guarantee future outperformance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable performance across different time periods.  The negative alpha values in 2021-2023 indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark (likely due to market conditions), while positive alphas in subsequent years show strong outperformance.  The beta consistently near zero suggests low correlation with the overall market, indicating high idiosyncratic risk.  This high volatility is expected given the company's early-stage nature.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -67.0% | 44.7% | -0.2 | 0.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 180.0% | 44.7% | -0.0 | 0.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 198.0% | 44.7% | 0.0 | 0.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($20.27) is slightly below the 20-day moving average ($20.74) and significantly above the 60-day moving average ($17.26), indicating a recent upward trend but potential for a pullback.  The 5-day moving average ($19.19) suggests a short-term consolidation.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI (44.66) is slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The negative PPO (-1.69) points to a bearish momentum.  The recent positive change in relative divergence (+0.3) indicates a short-term upward trend.  A 35.2% expected return over two years is a significant projection, and investors should carefully consider the high volatility and risk involved.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant variability, with both positive and negative surprises compared to expectations.  The large positive EPS in August 2023 is notable but needs to be examined alongside the subsequent negative results.  It is crucial to investigate the reasons behind these fluctuations.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-08-13 | -0.05 | -0.14 |
| 2024-05-14 | -0.21 | -0.14 |
| 2024-03-25 | -0.11 | -0.12 |
| 2023-11-13 | -0.22 | -0.12 |
| 2023-08-14 | 0.35 | -0.24 |


**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of available revenue and gross profit data is a significant limitation.  Further investigation into the company's financial statements is essential for a comprehensive assessment.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has demonstrated exceptional growth compared to the S&P 500, but this performance has been highly volatile.  The lack of key financial data, combined with the significant swings in earnings and the high relative divergence, suggests considerable risk.  While the projected long-term return is enticing, investors should exercise caution.  Thorough due diligence, including a review of the company's financial statements and future prospects, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The company's success heavily relies on its ability to secure and successfully execute future lunar landing contracts.  The high volatility makes this a high-risk, high-reward investment, suitable only for investors with a high risk tolerance.
