Okay, here's a breakdown of the LUNR (Intuitive Machines Inc) stock data provided, along with a comprehensive analysis.

**0) Summary Numbers and Initial Comparison**

*   **LUNR Cumulative Return:** 282.36%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 35.08%
*   **Divergence (LUNR - VOO):**
    *   Current: 247.3
    *   Relative Divergence: 42.2 (This means the current divergence is in the lower half of its historical range)

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha, Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Intuitive Machines Inc is a space exploration, infrastructure, and services company.
*   **Return Comparison:** LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) based on cumulative return. However, the Relative Divergence suggests that while the *difference* is large, it's not exceptionally high compared to its own historical divergence range.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    *   **2021-2023:** Underperformed the market significantly (negative Alpha), with low Beta suggesting low correlation to the market. High MDD indicates high volatility.
    *   **2022-2024:** Substantial outperformance (high Alpha), but still relatively low Beta. High MDD indicates high volatility.
    *   **2023-2025:** Very high outperformance (high Alpha), but Beta remains low. High MDD indicates high volatility.

    *   **Key Takeaways from Alpha/Beta:** LUNR's performance is largely independent of the overall market (low Beta). The high Alpha values in recent periods suggest company-specific factors (like contract wins, technological advancements, or investor sentiment) are driving returns. The consistent MDD of 83.4% demonstrates a very volatile stock that can change directions swiftly in either direction.

    *   60-day SMA: \$10.98

    *   **Analysis:** The current price is significantly above all three moving averages, indicating a strong upward trend in the short to medium term. The 5-day SMA being higher than the 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 60-day SMA, confirms this bullish trend.
