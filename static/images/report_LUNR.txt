**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Cumulative Return (LUNR):** 76.85%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 11.85%
* **Return Difference (LUNR vs VOO):** 65.00%
* **Relative Divergence:** 17.9% (Indicates LUNR's performance is relatively high compared to its historical performance against VOO, but not necessarily 17.9% better than VOO itself.)


**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a developer of lunar and space exploration technologies.  Over the period analyzed, LUNR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return substantially higher than VOOâ€™s. The provided data shows a substantial divergence in performance between LUNR and VOO, although the relative divergence suggests this outperformance is within the range of historical fluctuations.  Note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values suggest varying relationships between LUNR and the market depending on the time period.  High beta values (e.g., 2.1 in 2022-2024) imply high volatility and sensitivity to market movements, while lower betas (0.3 and 0.9) indicate less market sensitivity.  Negative alpha consistently suggests underperformance relative to the market risk adjusted return. These are short-term observations and should be interpreted with caution.  Further analysis is required to determine the consistency and statistical significance of these alpha and beta results.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0% | 61.5% | -66.0% | -0.1 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 72.3% | 151.0% | 2.1 |  |
| 2023-2025  | 74.0% | 72.3% | 62.0% | 0.9 |  |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $7.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.38

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend.  The significant difference between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a more substantial decline in recent weeks or months.  The increase from the previous close ('change': 6.79%) highlights a recent price jump.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.76 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 2.31 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 24.5% (vs. S&P 500). This is a high expected return and suggests significant potential for outperformance, but it is crucial to remember that this is a projection and may not materialize. The significant price increase reflected in  `{'price': 7.86, 'previousClose': 7.36, 'change': 6.79}` indicates a recent sharp upward movement in price, potentially reflecting market sentiment or news.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative earnings, although recent results indicate a trend towards positive EPS, which is significantly better than expected. This positive surprise may have contributed to the recent price jump.  Further analysis is needed to determine whether this trend is sustainable.


| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-03-25 | 0.04   | -0.08        |
| 2024-11-14 | 0.02   | -0.115       |
| 2024-08-13 | -0.05  | -0.14        |
| 2024-05-14 | -0.21  | -0.14        |
| 2024-03-25 | -0.11  | -0.12        |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information shows inconsistent revenue and profitability. While revenue has generally increased, profit margins have fluctuated significantly, including a large negative margin in Q2 2024. Negative equity throughout the period is a serious concern. The ROE (Return on Equity) also shows volatility, reflecting the overall financial instability.  This suggests high risk, requiring further investigation into the cause of these fluctuations.


Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.05B | 1.24% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.06B | 7.05% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.04B | -37.90% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.07B | 16.64% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.03B | 4.79% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $-1.00B | 14.87% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-0.49B | 11.28% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-0.23B | -7.97% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-0.49B | 20.15% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has demonstrated significant short-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with substantial volatility.  However, the company's financial statements reveal inconsistencies and significant risk.  The negative equity, fluctuating profit margins, and volatile ROE raise serious concerns about the company's financial health. While the recent positive EPS surprises and a high projected return are encouraging,  investors should proceed with extreme caution due to the high risk associated with the company's financial position and the substantial volatility reflected in the beta values.  A thorough due diligence, including a deep dive into the company's business model, future prospects, and management's strategy, is strongly recommended before any investment decision.  The high expected return should be considered in light of the substantial risk.
