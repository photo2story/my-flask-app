**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta  | Cap(B) |

*   **Beta:** Beta values differ significantly in two year windows. The Beta increased from 0.1 to 1.7, indicating increasing market correlation and volatility, meaning LUNR is becoming more sensitive to overall market movements.
