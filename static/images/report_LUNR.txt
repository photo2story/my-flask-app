## Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) Stock Report

This report analyzes Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR), a provider of lunar delivery services, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for LUNR is 106.89%, while VOO's is only 17.82%. This results in a substantial difference of 89.1 percentage points. The relative divergence of 21.1% indicates LUNR's performance is in the top 21.1% percentile of its historical range against VOO.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance:

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%   | 61.5% | -66.0% | -0.1 | 0.3   |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0%  | 72.3% | 151.0% | -0.1 | 2.1   |
| 2023-2025  | 104.0%  | 72.3% | 86.0% | -0.1 | 1.1   |

High volatility is evident (large MDD), and while the CAGR shows periods of strong growth, the negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market in some periods. The fluctuating beta indicates sensitivity to market movements that varies considerably.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.30
* **5-day MA:** $8.66
* **20-day MA:** $7.91
* **60-day MA:** $10.89

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below its 60-day MA, indicating a potential pullback from recent highs.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 70.26 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 3.64 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 19.9% (Long-term, 2+ years, outperformance relative to S&P 500)


The RSI nearing 70 suggests potential short-term overbought conditions, warranting caution. The positive PPO and relative divergence support the short-term upward trend. The high expected return is promising but should be viewed within the context of the high volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-25 | 0.04     | -0.08          |
| 2024-11-14 | 0.02     | -0.115         |
| 2024-08-13 | -0.05    | -0.14          |
| 2024-05-14 | -0.21    | -0.14          |
| 2024-03-25 | -0.11    | -0.12          |

Recent earnings have shown positive surprises compared to expectations. This positive trend is noteworthy, contrasting with the substantial volatility observed in other metrics.  Further analysis of the drivers behind these positive surprises is needed.


**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available. This significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis and requires further investigation.  This absence of crucial data makes a thorough assessment of the company's financial health impossible.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR presents a mixed picture. While it has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative returns and shows positive surprises in recent earnings, it suffers from extremely high volatility and a lack of crucial financial data (revenue and gross profit).  The high expected return is promising, but this should be viewed with caution given the inherent risk indicated by the high volatility and the absence of fundamental financial data.  Further research into the company's financials and underlying business model is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The recent positive earnings surprises are encouraging, but insufficient to overcome the data gaps and volatility.  The information provided needs to be significantly supplemented before a fully informed assessment can be made.
