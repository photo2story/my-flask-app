The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly variable performance across the specified periods, indicative of substantial risk:


| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|--------|

The high beta values suggest significant market sensitivity, while the fluctuating CAGRs highlight the inherent volatility of the investment.  The lack of significant alpha indicates that the returns are largely driven by market movements rather than company-specific factors.  Note that missing capitalization data hinders a full assessment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR demonstrates exceptionally high growth potential relative to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by extremely high risk. The company's volatile performance, negative equity, inconsistent profitability, and high beta suggest a highly speculative investment. The recent price drop and bearish technical indicators further emphasize the caution needed.  While the long-term expected return is attractive, the substantial risk necessitates a thorough due diligence process and a high risk tolerance before considering investment.  Further research into the underlying causes of the recent price drop and the company's financial situation is crucial.  This report should not be considered financial advice.
