Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided data on Intuitive Machines (LUNR) with analysis:

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Intuitive Machines Inc. is a space exploration, infrastructure, and services company focused on lunar missions.
*   **LUNR Cumulative Return:** 307.95%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 36.41%
