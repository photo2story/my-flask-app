**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) is a developer of lunar-based delivery services and robotic solutions.  LUNR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return vastly exceeding that of the index. The relative divergence of 64.0 places LUNR in the upper quantile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating strong outperformance.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance.  While 2022-2024 shows an impressive CAGR of 177%, it also exhibits a high beta (2.1), indicating substantial sensitivity to market movements.  The negative alpha across all periods suggests underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return, despite the high overall return.  The fluctuating beta highlights the inherent risk associated with LUNR's performance.  The small market capitalization (Cap(B)) contributes to this volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $7.73
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.785
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.785
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $13.7987

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a substantial price decline from its recent highs.  The small difference between the last close and the current price (0.13) doesn't signal a significant sudden move, up or down.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.9 (+), indicating a short-term upward trend in relative divergence.
* **Expected Return:** 28.6% (This is a substantial expected return over the long term, exceeding the S&P 500.  However, the validity of this prediction depends heavily on the underlying assumptions and methodology used to calculate it.  The high risk associated with LUNR should be considered.)

The high ROE figures in some quarters should be viewed with caution, given the high level of risk and negative equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has demonstrated impressive returns exceeding the S&P 500, but this performance comes with substantial risk.  The high beta, negative alpha in some periods, fluctuating profitability, and negative equity raise significant concerns. The recent positive EPS surprises are encouraging, but the overall financial picture suggests a volatile and risky investment.  The high expected return should be weighed against this significant risk profile.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in LUNR.  The substantial price drop from recent highs also indicates significant volatility.  Further analysis of the company's long-term growth prospects and financial health is crucial for informed decision-making.
