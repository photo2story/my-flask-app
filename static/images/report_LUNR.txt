**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a developer of lunar landing and surface mobility systems.  The cumulative return of LUNR (238.69%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO)  (30.02%) over the reviewed period.  The substantial difference in returns (208.67%) highlights a considerable outperformance, although this high return should be considered in the context of its high volatility (see MDD below). The relative divergence metric suggests that this level of outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -67.0% | 44.7% | -62.0% | 0.2 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 180.0% | 44.7% | 147.0% | 1.6 |  |
| 2023-2025  | 235.0% | 44.7% | 173.0% | 2.0 |  |

**Analysis:**  The CAGR shows significant variability, reflecting high volatility.  The negative Alpha in the initial period suggests underperformance relative to the market, while later periods show significant positive Alpha, indicating outperformance.  The increasing Beta reflects increasing market sensitivity.  Missing capitalization data limits a complete financial analysis.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 44.7% underscores the significant risk associated with this investment.

* **Closing Price:** $22.42
* **Last Market Price:** $21.68 (a -3.3% decrease from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $21.80
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.26

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend, although the recent drop indicates some potential for correction.

* **RSI:** 61.61 (slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.68 (negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.6 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 29.7% (S&P 500 outperformance)

The recent price drop (-3.3%) is reflected in the negative PPO, but the positive relative divergence change suggests the short-term trend may still be upward.  The significant expected return highlights the potential for long-term growth, exceeding the S&P 500.

**Analysis:** Revenue is growing, but profitability is inconsistent, reflecting the early stage of the company and the inherent risks associated with its business. Negative equity highlights the company's reliance on external funding.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR exhibits substantial growth potential, indicated by its high cumulative return and projected long-term outperformance of the S&P 500. However, this potential comes with considerable risk.  The high volatility, negative alpha in the earlier period and substantial MDD underline the uncertainty.  Inconsistent profitability and negative equity highlight the early-stage nature of the company and its dependence on external financing.  Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance before investing in LUNR. The positive recent earnings surprises and the upward trend in revenue should be considered alongside the significant risk profile.  Further investigation into the company's future projects and funding strategies is recommended.
