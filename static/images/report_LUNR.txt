## LUNR (Intuitive Machines Inc.) Stock Analysis

**Intuitive Machines Inc. is a space exploration company focused on lunar missions and related services.**

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **LUNR Cumulative Return:** 118.70%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 33.13%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** 85.6
*   **Divergence Range:** (Min: -67.3, Max: 676.8)
*   **Relative Divergence:** 20.5

**Analysis:** LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period.  However, the relative divergence of 20.5 indicates that while currently positive, LUNR's outperformance is closer to the lower end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500. This suggests that while it has been a strong performer, its recent performance relative to its own history is not exceptionally high.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%  | 61.5% | -65.0% | -0.1  | 0.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0%  | 72.3% | 147.0% | 2.1   | 2.1    |
| 2023-2025  | 115.0%  | 72.3% | 83.0%  | 1.0   | 1.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows highly variable performance across different periods.  The -50% CAGR for 2021-2023 is concerning, while the 177% and 115% for the subsequent periods are exceptionally high, but also indicate significant volatility.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is very high, consistently exceeding 60%, which indicates significant risk and price volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are volatile. A significantly negative alpha (-65.0%) for 2021-2023 indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark. However, the exceptionally high alpha values for the other periods (147.0% and 83.0%) suggest strong outperformance when the stock is doing well.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are also volatile and range from -0.1 to 2.1. This indicates the stock is highly sensitive to market movements, with the high Beta values suggesting that LUNR's price fluctuations tend to be larger than those of the overall market(VOO).

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** $8.64
*   **Previous Close:** $8.65
*   **Change:** -$0.12
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** $8.83
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $10.40
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $10.88

**Analysis:**  The current price is slightly down from the previous close.  The price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term downward trend.  The fact that the 5-day moving average is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages further reinforces this bearish signal.

### 3. Technical Indicators & Outlook

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 31.20 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -2.32
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_70%_Sell 0.4% of holdings (12 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 26.8% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI indicates a "Low Risk" environment, which could be misleading given the high volatility seen in the past. It might be indicating lower systematic risk in the broad market.
*   **RSI:**  The RSI value suggests that the stock is currently oversold, which could potentially lead to a bounce or a reversal.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests a downward trend in price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a cautious approach, advising to sell a small portion of holdings while maintaining a high cash ratio (70%). This implies a defensive stance.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days supports the recent downward price action.
*   **Expected Return:**  A 26.8% expected return (relative to the S&P 500) indicates a potentially attractive long-term investment opportunity, but this should be weighed against the high historical volatility.
*   **변동이슈:**{'price': 8.64, 'previousClose': 8.65, 'change': -0.12}는 크지 않으므로, 특별한 급반등/급하락 이슈는 반영되지 않았음

|------------|-------|----------|
| 2025-08-07 | -0.11 | -0.06    |

### 6. Financial Information:

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $0.00B  | -23.54%       |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.06B  | 10.68%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.05B  | 1.24%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.06B  | 7.05%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.00B  | -38.55%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE    |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.37B   | 0.01%  |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.13B   | 8.71%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $-1.00B   | 14.87% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-0.49B   | 11.28% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-0.23B   | -0.01% |

**Analysis:** Revenue is inconsistent, with periods of $0.00B revenue indicating project-based income. Profit margins are volatile and often negative, reflecting the high costs associated with space exploration. Equity is consistently negative, suggesting potential financial instability or aggressive financing strategies. The Return on Equity (ROE) is also very unstable.

### 7. Overall Analysis & Conclusion

Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.

*   **Positives:** Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in some periods, oversold RSI indicating potential for a bounce, a high expected return over the long term.
*   **Negatives:** Extremely high volatility (MDD), inconsistent revenue and profitability, negative equity, recent downward price trend, missed recent earnings estimates, volatile and period-dependent Alpha/Beta values.

**Recommendation:** Given the high volatility, inconsistent financial performance, and recent downward trend, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should closely monitor news and company announcements. A small, speculative position *may* be considered if the investor has a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. The "cash_70%_Sell 0.4%" hybrid signal underscores the need for a defensive portfolio allocation at this time.
