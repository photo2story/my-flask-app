## Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) Analysis

**Company Overview:** Intuitive Machines Inc. is a space exploration, infrastructure, and services company focused on lunar missions.

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **LUNR Cumulative Return:** 114.09%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 35.45%
*   **Spread:** 78.65%
*   **Relative Spread:** 19.6 (on a scale where historical variation ranges from -67.3 to 676.8)

**Analysis:** LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  However, the relative spread suggests that this outperformance, while positive, is not at the extreme upper end of its historical range. It's important to note that the high volatility in this stock makes the relative spread figure less informative compared to more stable investments.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%  | 61.5% | -65.0% | -0.1 | 0.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0%  | 72.3% | 147.0% | -0.1 | 2.1    |
| 2023-2025  | 111.0%  | 72.3% | 76.0%  | -0.1 | 1.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate varies wildly, showcasing high volatility.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown figures indicate significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** Strong positive alpha values in recent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025) show LUNR's potential to outperform its benchmark. However, the negative alpha from 2021-2023 highlights the risk.
*   **Beta:** Negative Beta suggests that LUNR's movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization (in Billions) showing fluctuations over time.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 8.41
*   **Previous Close:** 8.41
*   **Change:** -1.31%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 8.45
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 8.92
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 10.34

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average and significantly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a recent downtrend. The negative change indicates a slight downward pressure on the stock.

### 3. Indicators and Expected Return

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.47 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.08
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_8%_Buy 90% of cash (8352 shares - Safe - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 8% on 2025-09-09)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -0.6 (Suggests short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 30.6% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk overall. The RSI suggests the stock may be approaching oversold conditions, which could signal a potential buying opportunity. However, the negative change in relative divergence confirms the short-term downtrend. The hybrid signal suggests a cautious buying strategy (90% of cash), aligning with the low MRI.  The expected return is high, but remember this is long-term and subject to considerable uncertainty with a volatile stock like LUNR. The recent price movement (`change`: -1.31%) confirms downward pressure, potentially driven by the news of the convertible note offering (see below).

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Cantor Fitzgerald Maintains Overweight Rating:**  Positive news suggesting continued confidence from at least one analyst firm.
*   **USA Rare Earth Stock Potential:** Indirectly relevant; discusses a different company, but indicates potential investor interest in related sectors.
*   **A1R Water Merger:** Irrelevant.
*   **$300 Million Convertible Note Offering:** This is significant.  Convertible notes dilute existing shareholders if converted into equity.  This likely explains some of the recent price weakness.

### 4-2) Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.88 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Target Price:** 14.38 (average), suggesting significant upside potential.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes are shown, but the consensus remains positive.

**Analysis:** Analyst sentiment remains bullish despite the recent news and price action. The target price suggests considerable upside.

### 7. Overall Assessment

Intuitive Machines (LUNR) is a high-risk, high-reward stock.

**Key Positives:**

*   Strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500 (though volatile).
*   Positive analyst consensus and target price.
*   High potential long-term return.

**Key Negatives:**

*   High volatility and maximum drawdown.
*   Inconsistent revenue and profitability.
*   Negative equity and fluctuating ROE.
*   Recent EPS miss.
*   $300 million convertible note offering leading to potential dilution.

**Conclusion:**

LUNR is not a suitable investment for risk-averse investors.  The company shows promise in a high-growth sector, but its financial instability and dependence on capital raises are major concerns. The recent convertible note offering adds further uncertainty. The recommendation from the Hybrid Signal is a small buying position with only 90% of cash, which makes sense given the circumstances. Further research into the terms of the convertible note offering and the company's long-term financial plans is essential before making any investment decision.
