**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of significant decline (2021-2023) and substantial growth (2022-2024 and 2023-2025). This indicates high volatility.

*   **Alpha:** Positive and high Alpha figures (157% and 119%) in the later periods suggest that LUNR's performance is driven by company-specific factors rather than market movements.  The negative Alpha in 2021-2023 indicates underperformance relative to its risk-adjusted return.

*   **RSI:** The RSI is in overbought territory, suggesting the stock may be due for a correction or consolidation.
*   **PPO:** The Positive Price Oscillator (PPO) at 1.06 indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a cautious approach with partial buying, which aligns with the low-risk MRI but should be tempered by the overbought RSI.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** The decrease of -2.3 indicates recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:**  The very high expected return suggests significant potential upside but should be viewed with caution, as it likely reflects the high-growth, high-risk nature of the company.
*   **Price Change Impact:** The negative price change from the previous close suggests potential volatility and should be considered within the context of the overbought RSI.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       |  EPS | Expected EPS |
|:-----------|-----:|-------------:|
| 2025-05-13 | -0.2 |         -0.1 |
| 2025-03-25 |  0.04 |         -0.08 |

**Analysis:**

The data reveals a mix of earnings results. While there are instances where EPS exceeded expectations (2025-03-25, 2024-11-14, 2024-08-13), the company has reported losses in other quarters (2025-05-13, 2024-05-14). The most recent EPS (2025-05-13) missed expectations, which could contribute to short-term price volatility.

| 2024-06-30 |   -0.23B | -7.97% |
| 2024-03-31 |   -0.49B | 19.97% |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** The company is generating revenue, although it fluctuates quarter to quarter. This suggests potential for growth, but also indicates variability in operations.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins show considerable variability, including a significantly negative margin in one quarter. This indicates that profitability is not yet consistent, and the company faces challenges in managing costs.
*   **Equity:** The negative equity values indicate that the company has more liabilities than assets, which is a significant concern.
*   **ROE:** Despite the negative equity, the company has positive ROE (Return on Equity) in most quarters. This indicates that the company is able to generate profits even with its current capital structure, but the negative equity raises questions about long-term financial sustainability.

**7. Overall Analysis & Conclusion**

LUNR is a high-growth, high-risk stock.

**Summary:**

*   **Performance:** LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but this outperformance is volatile.
*   **Technicals:**  RSI indicates an overbought condition, while MRI suggests low market risk, which may not fully capture the stock's inherent volatility.
*   **Fundamentals:** The company is generating revenue, but profitability is inconsistent, and negative equity is a major concern.
*   **News:** Recent news suggests the company is subject to significant events and market scrutiny.
*   **Earnings:** Mixed earnings results, with some misses on EPS, contribute to the stock's volatility.
*   **Risk:** LUNR shows high volatility with a high MDD, with inconsistent financial results.

**Recommendation:**

Given the overbought RSI, recent price decline, mixed earnings reports, and negative equity, a cautious approach is warranted. Consider waiting for a pullback or consolidation before initiating or adding to a position. Investors should closely monitor the company's financial performance and industry developments before making any investment decisions.
