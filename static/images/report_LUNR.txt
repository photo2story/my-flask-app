## Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:**  Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) is a company developing and deploying lunar landers and related technologies.  The stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period, showing high volatility and potential for significant gains, but also considerable risk.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the outperformance is sustainable.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

LUNR's cumulative return (116.5%) vastly exceeds that of the S&P 500 (VOO) at 25.1%. The difference is 91.4 percentage points, placing it at the 18.6th percentile of the historical range of differences (max: 770.9%, min: -63.4%).  This highlights substantial outperformance, though volatility is a major concern given the wide range of historical performance differences.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -67.0%   | 44.7% | -0.2  | 0.2   |       |
| 2022-2024  | 180.0%   | 44.7% | -0.0  | 1.6   |       |
| 2023-2025  | 113.0%   | 44.7% | 0.0   | 1.3   |       |

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates wildly, indicating high volatility.  The negative alphas in the first two years suggest underperformance relative to the market, while the positive alpha in the last year shows outperformance.  The beta consistently fluctuates between above and below 1 showing sensitivity to broader market movements and potentially significant risk. Missing capitalization data prevents a full assessment.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $14.58
* **Last Market Price:** $13.66 (a -6.31% decrease from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $15.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $18.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $17.63

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent sharp drop (-6.31%) warrants further investigation.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.35  (Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -3.65 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -5.9% (Indicates a recent short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 58.3% (Significantly higher than S&P 500, but high risk implied)

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests bearish sentiment. However, the significant expected return highlights the potential for long-term growth. The large recent price drop (-6.31%) needs consideration,  but it is not necessarily conclusive in terms of future direction.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-08-13 | -0.05    | -0.14       |
| 2024-05-14 | -0.21    | -0.14       |
| 2024-03-25 | -0.11    | -0.12       |
| 2023-11-13 | -0.22    | -0.12       |
| 2023-08-14 | 0.35     | -0.24       |

Earnings have been largely negative recently, although frequently exceeding expectations.  The August 2023 positive EPS is an outlier, and further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of this volatility.

| 2023-09-30 | $-0.35B     | -9.62%        |

Revenue is erratic, and profit margins are highly volatile, frequently negative. Negative equity raises major concerns about the company's financial health.  ROE (Return on Equity) is also highly volatile.  This financial data suggests significant risk.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown remarkable outperformance against the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial risk.  High volatility in price, earnings, and financial metrics is a significant concern.  The negative equity raises serious red flags. While the long-term expected return is appealing, the financial instability and high volatility suggest that this stock is only suitable for highly risk-tolerant investors with a long-term horizon and a thorough understanding of the company's business model and its challenges.  Further due diligence, including a deep dive into the company's financials and future prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The recent price drop necessitates close monitoring of the market and future news.
