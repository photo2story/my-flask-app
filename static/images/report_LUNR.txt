**1. Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO) Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Intuitive Machines Inc. is a space exploration company focused on lunar missions and related services.
*   **Return Comparison:** LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, with a cumulative return of 282.36% compared to VOO's 35.08%.
*   **Divergence:** The divergence in cumulative returns between LUNR and VOO is currently 247.3.  The *relative* divergence of 42.2 indicates that the current difference in returns is positioned in the lower half of its historical range. This suggests that while LUNR has outperformed significantly, there's still potential for the divergence to widen further based on past volatility.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   The table shows that LUNR's CAGR, Alpha and Beta fluctuate significantly from year to year.
    *   **CAGR:** Exhibits a wide range of performance, from a substantial loss (-50.0%) to strong gains (186.0% and 279.0%), indicating high volatility.
    *   **MDD:** Always at 83.4%, the stock has a very high peak-to-trough decline, which makes this a very risky investment.
    *   **Alpha:** Indicates outperformance relative to a benchmark. Positive Alpha values (165.0%, 214.0%) suggest LUNR has delivered excess returns. The negative Alpha (-43.0%) indicates underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Consistently below 1 (0.1 in 2021-2023, 0.1 in 2022-2024, 0.0 in 2023-2025), this indicates that LUNR is theoretically less volatile than the overall market. However, given the dramatic return fluctuations, this Beta value is likely misleading and reflects a lack of strong correlation with the broad market.
    *   **Cap(B):** Its capitalization has increased from 0.3B to 2.0B, 2.4B.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 14.94
*   **Last Market Data:** Suggests a recent surge with a price of $16.69, a significant change of 11.71% compared to the previous close.
*   **Moving Averages:**  The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is near the 60-day SMA. This indicates a recent upward trend, but the proximity of the 20 and 60-day SMAs might suggest the trend is not strongly established or might be facing resistance.

**3. Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment) suggests the stock is moderately risky, and an investment is recommended.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 75.96 indicates the stock is overbought, which could signal a potential pullback or consolidation.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 2.29 signals an upward trend, but needs to be considered in conjunction with the overbought RSI.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" indicates a strong buy signal based on the indicators, especially given the very safe MRI rating. The monthly investment recommendation of 2.0% further reinforces this bullish stance.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** +11.1 indicates a short-term upward surge.
*   **Expected Return:** 47.0% is a high expected return, suggesting significant potential upside if held long-term.
