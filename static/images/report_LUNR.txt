**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) is a developer of lunar-based transportation and logistics services.  The company significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return difference of 67.06%. The relative divergence of 18.0 indicates that LUNR's performance is in the higher range compared to its historical performance relative to the VOO. However, this is not a guarantee of future outperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent results across different periods. While 2022-2024 shows a high CAGR and positive Alpha, other periods show negative Alpha, suggesting that the stock's performance is not consistently better than the market after accounting for risk. The Beta fluctuates significantly, indicating varying levels of market sensitivity.  High Beta values in some periods (e.g., 2.2) suggest heightened volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations.


| Year       | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%     | 61.5% | -0.1  | 0.3   |        |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0%    | 72.3% | -0.1  | 2.2   |        |
| 2023-2025  | 73.0%     | 72.3% | -0.1  | 1.0   |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $7.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $14.18

The recent price shows a sharp decline (-6.44%) compared to the previous close. The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The significant difference between the 60-day and shorter-term moving averages highlights the recent price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.55 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 2.80 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.9 (+) (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 27.7% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)


The recent price drop of -6.44% suggests a potential short-term bearish trend. However, the positive PPO and upward relative divergence indicate some underlying bullish momentum. The expected return of 27.7% is a long-term forecast and doesn't reflect the current market volatility. The medium risk MRI score adds caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |

| 2024-03-25 | -0.11    | -0.12          |

Recent earnings show a mixed picture. While the company has exceeded expectations in the last two quarters (2025-03-25 and 2024-11-14), previous quarters showed significant negative EPS.  The trend indicates a recent improvement but with considerable volatility.

| 2023-12-31 | $-0.23B     | -3.86%        |

Financial data shows fluctuating revenue and profitability.  Negative equity throughout the period is a significant concern.  While ROE is positive in most quarters, the large swings suggest considerable financial instability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500, exhibiting a high cumulative return.  However, this is coupled with high volatility and inconsistent performance, as reflected in the fluctuating Alpha and Beta. Recent price action shows a sharp decline, and financial statements reveal concerns regarding negative equity and fluctuating profitability.  The positive long-term expected return is promising, but investors should carefully consider the significant risks associated with LUNR's volatile performance and financial situation before making any investment decisions.  Further research into the company's future prospects and the reasons behind the recent price drop is crucial.
