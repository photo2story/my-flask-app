**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) develops and manufactures lunar landers and related technologies for space exploration.  Over the periods analyzed, LUNR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a 72.4% higher cumulative return.  However, this outperformance is highly volatile, as indicated by the wide range in the relative divergence (max: 689.4, min: -45.9).  The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance across different periods:

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                  |
|------------|----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| 2021-2023  | -49.0%   | 61.7%  | -0.0  | 0.3   |        | Significant losses, low beta             |
| 2022-2024  | 164.0%  | 89.2%  | 0.0   | 2.1   |        | High growth, high beta, high volatility |
| 2023-2025  | 48.0%    | 89.2%  | 0.0   | 0.8   |        | Moderate growth, moderate beta           |


The high beta values (especially in 2022-2024) suggest a high sensitivity to market movements.  The inconsistent CAGR indicates significant volatility and risk. The lack of a consistent alpha suggests that the outperformance isn't solely due to skill, but potentially due to market timing or sector-specific factors.  The missing market capitalization data prevents a complete analysis of valuation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $6.87
* **Previous Close:** $7.54
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $14.84

The stock price has experienced a recent decline (-8.89%), currently trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages. This suggests bearish momentum.  The significant difference between the 60-day average and the current price indicates a substantial price drop recently.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.6331 (High Risk) – Suggests elevated market risk.
* **RSI:** 43.08 –  Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting slightly bearish sentiment, but not oversold.
* **PPO:** 1.61 – Positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.8 (Negative) – Short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 148.5% –  Indicates significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  However, this high expected return needs to be considered with the high risk involved. The recent -8.89% price drop should be factored into this long-term projection.  It signals a potential period of high volatility with both upside and downside risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference    | Notes                                    |
|------------|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2025-03-25 | 0.04     | -0.08        | 0.12           | Positive surprise, but still low absolute EPS |
| 2024-11-14 | 0.02     | -0.115       | 0.135          | Positive surprise                         |
| 2024-08-13 | -0.05    | -0.14        | 0.09           | Positive surprise, but still loss          |
| 2024-05-14 | -0.21    | -0.14        | -0.07          | Negative surprise, significant loss        |
| 2024-03-25 | -0.11    | -0.12        | 0.01           | Near expectations, loss                     |

The recent earnings show a mixed picture with some positive surprises, particularly in the last two quarters.  However, profitability remains a concern, with several quarters showing significant losses. Consistent profitability needs to be established to support the high long-term expected return.

|------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-1.00      | 14.87%        | Negative equity, high ROE (potentially due to high debt) |
| 2024-09-30 | $-0.49      | 11.28%        | Negative equity                            |

| 2023-12-31 | $-0.23      | -3.86%        | Negative equity, negative ROE                 |

The company has negative equity throughout the period, indicating a high level of debt.  While the ROE is sometimes high, this should be viewed cautiously due to the negative equity position.  High debt levels increase financial risk.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown significant price volatility and outperformance against the S&P 500 over certain periods. However, this comes with substantial risk. The high beta, negative equity, inconsistent profitability, and high market risk indicator all point to a highly volatile investment.  The projected long-term expected return is compelling, but the high risk profile requires careful consideration.  Investors should have a high risk tolerance and understand the company's operational challenges and high debt levels before investing. Further due diligence, including a thorough analysis of the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
