**0. Overview:**

The relative divergence, considering historical highs and lows, places this performance at the 24.4th percentile.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD (%) | Alpha | Beta | Cap (B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| 2021-2023  | -67.0%    | 44.7%   | -0.2  | 0.2   |         |
| 2022-2024  | 180.0%   | 44.7%   | -0.0  | 1.7   |         |
| 2023-2025  | 166.0%   | 44.7%   | 0.0   | 1.7   |         |

The high volatility of LUNR is evident in the significant changes in CAGR and Beta across the different periods.  The negative alpha in 2021-2023 suggests underperformance relative to the market during that period, while the positive alpha in subsequent years indicates improved performance.  The high beta, especially in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025, highlights the stock's sensitivity to market movements.  The lack of consistent capitalization data hinders a complete financial analysis.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $18.14
* **Last Day Change:** -$1.80 (-8.98%)  This shows a significant price drop.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $19.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $16.73

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average indicating potential support. The recent large single-day drop of almost 9% warrants caution.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.51 (suggests the stock is oversold, possibly indicating a potential bounce, but should be considered alongside other indicators)
* **PPO:** -3.12 (negative PPO confirms bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.3% (short-term price decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 43.2% (significantly higher than expected S&P 500 returns.) This is highly dependent on continued positive momentum.


The recent sharp price drop (-8.98%) significantly impacts the short-term outlook.  While the oversold RSI suggests potential for a rebound, the negative PPO and overall bearish trend should be considered. The high expected return reflects the inherent risk and potential reward in this volatile stock.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue ($B) | Profit Margin (%) |

| 2023-09-30 | -$0.35      | -9.62   |

Revenue is growing, but profitability is highly volatile and frequently negative. Negative equity throughout the period is a significant concern.  ROE is also inconsistent, reflecting the overall financial instability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR exhibits exceptionally high growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  However, this growth is coupled with substantial volatility and considerable financial risk. Negative equity and inconsistent profitability raise serious concerns about the company's long-term financial stability. The recent sharp price drop (-8.98%) highlights this risk. While the high expected return is enticing, investors should carefully weigh the potential rewards against the significant downside risk. Further investigation into the company's underlying business model, future contracts, and overall financial health is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment approach, with a tolerance for high risk, may be warranted, but only after thorough due diligence.
