| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -57.0% | 68.6% | -49.0% | 1.6 | 0.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 101.0% | 89.0% | 79.0% | -0.0 | 2.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 44.0% | 89.0% | 7.0% | -0.9 |

**Analysis:** The CAGR shows significant volatility, with periods of substantial losses and gains.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights the risk associated with this investment. Alpha values fluctuate widely, suggesting inconsistent outperformance relative to the market. Beta values are inconsistent, and change considerably, implying sensitivity to market movements changes over the years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $7.54
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.77
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $15.06

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but significantly below its 60-day moving average, indicating a recent downtrend.  The substantial drop from the previous close (-9.21%) suggests a significant negative event impacting the price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.515 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 51.55 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 2.20 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 81.9% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 expected over the long term (2+ years) given the current market conditions and the investment rationale. Note: this is a prediction, not a guarantee.)

The high MRI indicates considerable risk.  While the RSI and PPO suggest some bullish momentum, the recent significant price drop warrants caution.  The large drop in price from the previous close suggests either profit-taking, or negative news impacting the share price.

**Analysis:** Revenue shows some volatility, but generally increasing trend in recent quarters. Profit margins are inconsistent, with some periods of significant losses.  Negative equity throughout the period is a significant concern, indicating the company is operating with substantial liabilities.  ROE is also volatile but generally positive in recent quarters.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR exhibits high growth potential, but also significant risk.  While its recent performance has outpaced the S&P 500, considerable volatility and negative financial indicators (negative equity, volatile profit margins) raise concerns. The recent sharp price drop requires careful consideration.  A long-term investment approach might be suitable for risk-tolerant investors, but thorough due diligence and ongoing monitoring are crucial.  The positive earnings surprise and improving revenue suggest a potential turning point, but the negative equity and high risk profile should be considered carefully.
