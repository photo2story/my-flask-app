**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.06B   | 7.05%         |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.04B   | -37.90%       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has demonstrated exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, but this performance is characterized by extreme volatility.  The high relative divergence highlights the risk associated with this stock.  While the expected return is substantial,  it's crucial to consider the negative PPO, inconsistent earnings, and volatile profit margins.  Further investigation into the drivers of both the positive returns and the significant losses is needed before forming a definitive opinion.  Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance before considering an investment in LUNR.  The high volatility suggests that a long-term, diversified investment approach might be preferable, with careful consideration of position sizing to mitigate potential losses.
