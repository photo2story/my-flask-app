## Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR) Stock Report

This report analyzes Intuitive Machines Inc. (LUNR), a company developing and deploying lunar landing and surface transportation systems.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

LUNR's cumulative return of 88.55% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 10.14%.  The difference is 78.4%, placing it in the 19.5th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (considering a maximum deviation of 677.2% and a minimum deviation of -67%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results:

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                      |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0% | 61.5% | -0.1  | 0.3   |        | Significant negative CAGR, high MDD            |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0%| 72.3% | -0.1  | 2.1   |        | High CAGR, but high beta indicating high volatility |
| 2023-2025  | 85.0%  | 72.3% | -0.1  | 1.0   |        |  Good CAGR, but still high Beta              |


The negative alpha across all periods suggests underperformance relative to the market benchmark after adjusting for beta (volatility).  The high beta values in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 indicate that LUNR's price is significantly more volatile than the overall market. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) is missing from the provided data.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $8.38
* **Previous Close:** $7.26
* **Daily Change:** +15.51% (Significant daily increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $14.33

The current price is above the 5 and 20-day moving averages but significantly below the 60-day moving average. This suggests recent strong upward momentum but potential for a pullback given the substantial difference between the current price and the 60-day average.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 58.23 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.57 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 25% (significantly higher than S&P 500)

The high MRI, approaching overbought RSI, and the price increase of 15.51% suggest caution, potentially indicating a short-term overbought condition.  However, a positive PPO and the high expected return signal potential for long-term growth. The significant daily price increase might be a short-term event.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|---------------|------------|
| 2025-03-25 | $0.04   | $-0.08        | $0.12      |
| 2024-11-14 | $0.02   | $-0.115       | $0.135     |

| 2024-05-14 | $-0.21  | $-0.14        | $-0.07     |
| 2024-03-25 | $-0.11  | $-0.12        | $0.01      |

While the company has consistently exceeded expected EPS in recent quarters (except Q2 2024), the overall EPS remains low and volatile.  This warrants further investigation into the underlying drivers of these earnings.

The company has experienced significant volatility in both revenue and profitability.  The negative equity is a major concern and requires further analysis to understand the financial health of the company.  High ROE despite negative equity is noteworthy and could indicate financial leverage or accounting practices that need further scrutiny.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

LUNR exhibits high growth potential indicated by its substantial outperformance of the S&P 500 and high projected long-term returns. However,  the company also shows considerable risk due to significant price volatility (high beta), negative equity, fluctuating profitability, and a high market risk indicator. The recent price surge might be unsustainable in the short term.  A thorough due diligence involving a deeper dive into the company's financials, future prospects (especially considering its lunar landing focus), and competitive landscape is essential before making any investment decision.  The negative equity is a critical factor requiring careful consideration and further investigation.
