**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a provider of lunar surface access services, aiming to support the exploration of the moon.  LUNR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of 106.90% compared to VOO's 17.82%.  The substantial difference highlights LUNR's considerable outperformance, but it's crucial to consider the risk involved given the high volatility indicated by its high CAGR and MDD.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%  | 61.5%   | -0.66% | -0.1  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 72.3%   | 151.0% | -0.1  | 2.1    |
| 2023-2025  | 104.0% | 72.3%   | 86.0%  | -0.1  | 1.1    |


The table shows highly volatile performance with significant swings in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  While the high CAGR in 2022-2024 is positive, the negative alpha suggests that the return is not solely attributable to market performance but also influenced by significant risk factors.  The fluctuating beta indicates varying sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.30
* **Previous Close:** $8.62
* **Daily Change:** +7.89% (Significant daily increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $8.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $10.89

The current price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential retracement. The 7.89% daily increase signals a notable short-term price surge, potentially influenced by recent news or market sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 70.26 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 3.64 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 19.9% (Significant excess return compared to S&P 500)

The RSI is nearing the overbought zone, suggesting a potential correction.  However, the positive PPO and upward relative divergence support the current upward trend. The high expected return is attractive, but it's crucial to remember this is a long-term projection and subject to market volatility.  The sharp daily price increase ('change': 7.89%) suggests a potential short-term price correction may occur soon.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown remarkable outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a substantially higher cumulative return. However, this performance comes with significant volatility and risk, as indicated by the high CAGR and MDD, negative alpha, and fluctuating beta.  Recent earnings have been better than expected, but the company's financials reveal inconsistent revenue, fluctuating profit margins, and negative equity, raising concerns about its long-term financial health. The high expected return is alluring but must be considered alongside the inherent risk.  Investors should proceed with caution and thoroughly research LUNR's business model and future prospects before making any investment decisions.  Given the high volatility, diversification of the investment portfolio is strongly advised.
