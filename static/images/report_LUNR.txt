* **5-day Moving Average:** $8.01
* **20-day Moving Average:** $8.18
* **60-day Moving Average:** $15.52

The recent price shows a significant jump compared to the previous closing price and is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages. However, it is substantially below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term recovery following a longer-term decline.

The last market price shows a sharp increase (8.58%), suggesting a potential rebound. While the RSI indicates a neutral market, the PPO suggests positive momentum.  The negative relative divergence change, however, warns of a short-term bearish trend. The projected long-term expected return of 46.2% is promising, but its reliability depends on the accuracy of the projection model and whether the company can overcome its challenges.

Further due diligence, including examining the companyâ€™s future contracts and operational plans, is crucial.
