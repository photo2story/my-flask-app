**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a provider of lunar-surface landing services and related technologies.

The provided data shows LUNR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While VOO had a cumulative return of 10.15%, LUNR achieved a 67.63% return. The significant difference, however, needs to be viewed in context of the high volatility demonstrated by LUNR's historical performance (relative return difference of 16.9%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -50.0%  | 61.5%   | -0.1  | 0.3   |        |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 72.3%   | -0.1  | 2.1   |        |
| 2023-2025  | 64.0%   | 72.3%   | -0.1  | 0.9   |        |

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant volatility, ranging from a substantial loss to a very high gain.  The negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market benchmark adjusted for risk (beta). The beta fluctuates significantly, implying substantial risk exposure, and a potential for high sensitivity to market movements.  The lack of market capitalization data hinders a complete assessment.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of $7.45 shows a downward trend compared to the previous close ($7.565) and the moving averages. The price is significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a possible bearish trend. The proximity to the 5-day and 20-day averages might indicate a short-term support level.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.35 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 2.49 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** -1.0 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 26.4% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is predicted, however this prediction should be carefully evaluated due to high volatility).  The significant negative price change (-1.52%) suggests a recent market downturn that is not yet reflected in the longer term expectations.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-25 | 0.04     | -0.08         |
| 2024-11-14 | 0.02     | -0.115        |
| 2024-08-13 | -0.05    | -0.14         |
| 2024-05-14 | -0.21    | -0.14         |
| 2024-03-25 | -0.11    | -0.12         |

Earnings have been consistently better than expected recently. However, the company is still operating at a loss. The positive surprise in recent quarters might reflect positive market sentiment driving a price surge rather than significant change in operational capacity.

The company shows negative equity, a sign of significant financial risk.  ROE is also highly volatile.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has demonstrated a strong recent return, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this performance is accompanied by substantial volatility and risk. Negative alpha, fluctuating beta, negative equity, and volatile profit margins all suggest a high-risk, high-reward investment.  The recent price decline, coupled with the negative equity and volatile financial metrics, indicates caution is warranted.  While the longer-term projected return is positive, the significant risk inherent in the company requires investors to thoroughly assess their risk tolerance before investing.  Further investigation into the company's financial health and future growth prospects is strongly recommended.  The currently positive earnings surprises should be further analyzed to determine their sustainability.
