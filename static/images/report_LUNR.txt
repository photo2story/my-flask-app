**Analysis:** The provided Alpha/Beta analysis paints a mixed picture. The negative Alpha during the 2021-2023 period indicates underperformance relative to its benchmark, while the high Alpha in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods suggests significant outperformance. The Beta values fluctuate and are relatively close to zero, which suggests low systematic risk. Additionally, the high MDD(Maximum Drawdown) indicates that this stock has been experiencing high risk over these periods.

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 11.576
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 11.2816

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a recent downward trend. The last market data confirms this, showing a 4.29% drop. This recent price decrease should be considered a significant negative signal, as the magnitude of price change is relatively large.

*   **RSI:** 35.95

*   The negative PPO suggests a bearish trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal advocates a move to 70% cash and selling a small portion of holdings, indicating a cautious outlook.
*   The negative change in relative deviation over the last 20 days confirms a short-term downtrend relative to the S&P 500.
*   Despite the recent downturn, the expected return of 95.3% suggests a very optimistic long-term outlook, anticipating significant outperformance versus the S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon.
