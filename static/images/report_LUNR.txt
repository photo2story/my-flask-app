Given the overbought condition, recent negative news, and analyst downgrade, a **cautious approach** is warranted. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks against the high expected return and consider waiting for a potential correction before establishing or adding to a position. Monitor news related to NASA contracts and any further analyst updates closely.
