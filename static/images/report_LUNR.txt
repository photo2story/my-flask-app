The recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500, coupled with negative technical indicators, paints a bearish outlook.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering any investment in LUNR.  The high projected return should be viewed with skepticism given the company's current financial situation and operational history.
