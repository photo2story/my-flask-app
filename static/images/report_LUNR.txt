**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Intuitive Machines Inc. is a provider of lunar landing services.  The company significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of 184.53% compared to VOO's 30.76%.  The 153.8% difference highlights substantial outperformance.  However, the relative divergence of 26% suggests this outperformance is not necessarily at an extreme historical high compared to VOO.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta values show inconsistent performance depending on the period considered. While recent periods show high returns (180-181%), indicating strong outperformance (positive alpha), earlier periods experienced substantial losses (-67%). The beta values fluctuate significantly, suggesting high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  Note that a higher Beta typically implies greater risk.  The changing beta values over time imply a fluctuating correlation with the overall market.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -67.0% | 44.7% | -62.0% | 0.2 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 180.0% | 44.7% | 147.0% | 1.7 |  |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $19.16
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $18.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $16.998

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend.  However, the recent price increase (Last-market data shows a 2.19% increase) might signal a short-term reversal, though confirmation is needed.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 34.86 (below 50, suggesting the stock might be oversold)
* **PPO:** -2.72 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.6 (indicates a recent decrease in the relative strength of LUNR compared to VOO)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 39.2% (This is a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but should be viewed with caution given the inherent uncertainty of long-term projections).  The recent price increase (2.19%)  might be a minor short-term uptrend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LUNR has shown periods of exceptional growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance is coupled with considerable volatility and inconsistent financial results. The negative equity and fluctuating profitability raise significant concerns.  The high beta value suggests substantial risk. While the projected long-term expected return is attractive, investors should exercise caution due to the company's financial instability and inconsistent earnings. Further in-depth analysis of the business model, future prospects, and the reasons behind the negative equity are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current price is below several key moving averages, suggesting a potentially bearish short-term outlook.  However, the recent price jump could represent a short-term counter-trend.  The overall risk profile is high.
