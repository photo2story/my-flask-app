**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has shown mixed performance relative to the S&P 500, with recent underperformance. While some periods exhibit positive alpha, others show significant negative alpha, highlighting the volatility inherent in the mining sector.  Technical indicators suggest near-term upward momentum but approach overbought conditions.  Financial data reveals fluctuating profitability and ROE, requiring deeper analysis to understand the underlying drivers. The negative long-term expected return, compared to the S&P 500, is concerning and should be carefully considered alongside other factors before investment.  Further investigation into the causes of EPS volatility and the factors affecting ROE is crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.  Consider consulting a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
