Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.68%, NEM significantly underperformed. The difference is -100.7%, placing it at the minimum end of the historical range of divergence. This indicates NEMâ€™s performance has lagged behind the broader market considerably during this period.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $38.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $37.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $40.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $45.66

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (32.87):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.1771):** Negative value shows the price momentum is bearish.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-1.0):** Shows a recent downward trend in relative performance compared to the market.
* **Expected Return (-1583.4%):** This extremely negative expected return highlights the significant underperformance of NEM compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon (2+ years). This figure needs further investigation and context as it seems implausibly low.  It's likely reflecting the extreme negative returns observed in the provided data and should be treated with caution.

The current price ($38.09) is relatively close to the 5-day moving average and well below the 20 and 60 day averages.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and divergence indicate ongoing bearish momentum.  There is no indication of a sudden drastic price change (either a sharp upturn or downturn).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally been increasing, peaking at $4.61B in Q3 2024. However, there was a significant drop in revenue in Q4 2023, followed by a rebound.
* **EPS:** EPS shows considerable volatility.  A sharp increase from $0.15 in Q1 2024 to $0.8 in Q3 2024 is notable, but followed by a repetition of the $0.2 reported in Q4 2023, suggesting potential inconsistency.  Without expectations data, it's impossible to definitively determine beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue growth is generally positive, though fluctuates. Profit margin has also seen fluctuations but remains relatively stable.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows mostly upward trend, indicating a generally healthy capital position.  ROE, however, is highly volatile and includes a significant negative value (-10.88%) in Q4 2023 which requires further investigation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent revenue growth is positive, EPS is volatile and ROE shows significant swings. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions but bearish momentum prevails.  The extremely negative long-term expected return is a major concern and warrants further investigation to understand its source.   Additional information about recent news, analyst opinions, and expectations data is critical for a more comprehensive assessment.  The lack of this information severely limits the confidence level of this analysis.
