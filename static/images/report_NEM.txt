### 7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is showing mixed signals. While recent earnings, revenue, and profitability have improved, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 historically, and the *expected return* is alarmingly negative.  The positive recent price action and technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest a short-term upward trend. However, the high MDD, negative alpha, and negative expected return highlight significant risks. The positive hybrid signal and news of recent business events suggests opportunities for investment.

**Recommendation:** Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. Further investigation into the reasons for the negative expected return and the "major business developments" is essential before making any investment decisions.  Monitor company announcements, analyst reports, and industry trends closely. The high volatility suggested by recent news requires careful risk management.
