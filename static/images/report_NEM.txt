The earnings and revenue growth coupled with improving profit margins and ROE support the fundamental strength of the company.

**However, several factors warrant caution:**

*   **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 historically, and the models project this underperformance to continue in the long term, a key concern.
*   **Negative Alpha and High Beta:** The negative Alpha and high Beta indicate that NEM is a riskier investment that has not delivered risk-adjusted returns compared to the market.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The RSI approaching overbought territory suggests a potential pullback. The negative PPO indicates some bearish momentum.

**Investment Recommendation:**

*   **Short-Term:** The recent positive momentum suggests a possible short-term trading opportunity.
*   **Long-Term:** Given the historical underperformance, negative expected return, and other risk factors, a long-term investment in NEM should be approached with caution. Potential investors should closely monitor the company's ability to reverse its historical underperformance and improve its risk-adjusted returns compared to the broader market.
