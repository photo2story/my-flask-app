**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compounded Annual Growth Rate varies significantly across the periods, with the most recent period (2023-2025) showing a strong positive return.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative, meaning NEM underperformed relative to its expected return based on its beta and the market's return, except for 2016-2018 and 2023-2025 periods. The -79% from 2022-2024 indicates a very large relative underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta has increased over time, suggesting NEM's price movements are becoming increasingly correlated and volatile relative to the market. Note, however, that the relatively low beta values mean this volatility is still less than the S&P 500's volatility.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated but has significantly increased recently.

*   **Close:** 99.34

*   **5-day SMA:** 98.93
*   **20-day SMA:** 92.093
*   **60-day SMA:** 88.3068

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly below the previous day's close, indicating a small recent dip.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, and both are above the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term uptrend in price, but it might be cooling.  The fact that the 5-day is only *slightly* above the 20-day could mean the upward momentum is weakening.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests a medium risk level for investment in NEM.
*   **RSI:** Indicates the stock may be overbought, and a price correction might be imminent.
*   **PPO:** Positive, meaning the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, confirms uptrend.
