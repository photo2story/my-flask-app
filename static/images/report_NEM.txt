The current price is $46.54, slightly below the 5-day moving average ($46.61) but above both the 20-day ($43.71) and 60-day ($41.37) moving averages. This suggests a recent price consolidation or slight upward trend after a period of lower prices.

* **RSI (73.12):**  Indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (0.79):**  Positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):**  A positive 1.0 indicates short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (-142.1%):**  This strongly negative long-term expected return (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a significant concern.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis. This is a major limitation in assessing the company's financial health and future prospects.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent price action shows some positive momentum, technical indicators suggest caution.  The projected negative long-term return compared to the S&P 500 is a serious concern.  The lack of key financial data hinders a complete evaluation.  Further investigation is needed to determine the drivers of the recent earnings volatility and the long-term outlook.  The absence of crucial financial data significantly limits the confidence in any investment decision.
