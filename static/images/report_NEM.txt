Newmont Corporation's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.  While NEM achieved a 29.46% return, VOO achieved a 122.19% return.  This results in a substantial lag of -92.7%, placing it at the 2.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided data indicates considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.
