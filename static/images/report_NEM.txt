## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold and copper mining company.  Recent performance shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), with a negative alpha suggesting underperformance against the market benchmark. While recent earnings have shown growth,  high RSI and negative expected return raise concerns.  Further analysis is needed to determine the investment viability.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) showed a cumulative return of 46.23% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 104.98%. This represents a significant lag of -58.8%, placing it at the 20.5th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-101.2% to 105.8%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance against the market. While periods of positive alpha (outperformance) existed (2018-2021), recent years (2021-2025) show consistently high positive alpha, suggesting significant outperformance *if the predictions are accurate*, but potentially high risk and volatility.  The high and increasing Beta also reflects significant market sensitivity.  The market cap has fluctuated but generally increased over the period.  Note that the CAGR figures are significantly higher than the cumulative return, indicating highly volatile performance.

| 2018-2020  | 47.0% | 13.9% | 19.0% | 0.1 | 58.3 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $47.36
* **5-day Moving Average:** $47.69
* **20-day Moving Average:** $44.51
* **60-day Moving Average:** $42.71

The price is currently slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent downward pressure. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term upward trend.  The previous day's price drop of $0.84 (-1.76%) suggests some downward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 77.32 (Overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.84 (Positive momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +1.0 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -89.6% (This is a very significant negative expected return and requires further investigation into its calculation methodology.  It strongly suggests significant future underperformance relative to the model.)

The high RSI suggests the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction. The positive PPO indicates upward momentum, but this is countered by the overbought RSI and very negative expected return. The negative price change of $0.84 doesn't indicate a sharp drop but reinforces the negative expected return.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM shows strong recent revenue and profit growth.  However, the stock is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, with a concerning negative expected return. Technical indicators suggest an overbought condition, potentially signaling a near-term correction.  The highly volatile performance and high beta highlight significant risk.  The projected future alpha (from the Alpha/Beta table) is highly positive, but requires independent verification and careful consideration given the other indicators.  Before investing, further investigation is crucial to understand the basis for the exceptionally negative expected return and the discrepancies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entry).  A thorough review of the company's long-term growth strategy and industry outlook is recommended.
