| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $44.88
* **Last Market Price:** $45.24 (Slight increase of $0.79)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $43.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $41.85
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $40.91

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.58 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.91 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.8 (Short-term upward trend)

The recent price increase is notable (0.79). While the RSI suggests potential overbought conditions, the PPO and relative divergence indicators support the short-term uptrend.  However, the extremely negative expected return of -166.6% suggests significant long-term risk relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a very low probability of outperforming the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years) based on current data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

*Note: There's a duplicate entry for October 24th, 2024.  This needs clarification.*

Earnings have shown a generally upward trend in recent quarters (excluding the repeated entry).  However,  the large variation in EPS from quarter to quarter needs further investigation to determine its underlying cause.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, showing considerable volatility and substantial negative returns in recent periods. While recent earnings and revenue figures appear positive,  the profitability metrics and ROE show inconsistencies that require deeper analysis. Short-term technical indicators suggest a potential upward trend, but the extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 cautions against long-term investment without further investigation into the reasons for its persistent underperformance.  The data suggests a high-risk investment with a low probability of outperforming the market in the long term. Further due diligence, including examining the reasons behind the volatile earnings and ROE, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
