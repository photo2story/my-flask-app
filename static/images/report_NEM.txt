## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Newmont Corporation (NEM), a leading global gold producer, based on provided financial data.  We will compare its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), analyze key financial metrics, and provide a concluding assessment.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading global gold producer with significant operations across multiple jurisdictions.

* **Cumulative Return (NEM):** 46.42%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 76.31%
* **Return Difference:** -29.9%  This indicates NEM underperformed VOO by almost 30 percentage points over the measured period.
* **Relative Deviation:** 28.7% This places the current performance relatively low compared to the historical range of the difference between NEM and VOO returns (-78% to +89%).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis showcases inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO). While periods of strong outperformance (Alpha > 0) are evident, other periods show significant underperformance (Alpha < 0). The Beta values, consistently above 0, signify NEM's sensitivity to market fluctuations, implying higher volatility compared to the market benchmark.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates, indicating shifts in market valuation.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $54.54
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $55.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $50.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.48

The closing price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.  However, it is above the 60-day moving average, suggesting some longer-term support.  The recent price drop of $1.21 (Last-market data) further reinforces the short-term bearish momentum.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)  Indicates a moderate level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 66.27 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions).
* **PPO:** 1.02 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum).
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +0.9 (Short-term upward trend).
* **Expected Return:** -33.0% This represents a significant expected loss relative to the S&P 500, specifically over the long-term investment horizon of 2+ years.  This is a key concern.

The significant negative price change of $1.21 from the previous close suggests a potential negative market reaction, possibly a temporary correction or part of the ongoing downtrend.  The negative expected return emphasizes the need for caution.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.80 | $4.61 Billion |
| 2024-07-25 | $0.74 | $4.40 Billion |
| 2024-04-29 | $0.15 | $4.02 Billion |
| 2023-10-26 | $0.20 | $2.49 Billion |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.20 | $2.49 Billion | *(Duplicate Entry - likely a data error)*

There's a potential data error with duplicate entries for October 24th, 2024.  Excluding the duplicate, revenue shows a generally increasing trend. EPS also demonstrates growth excluding Q1 2024, suggesting the company's financial performance is variable and further investigation is warranted.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $5.65B     | 45.51%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $4.61B     | 36.13%        |

| 2024-03-31  | $4.02B     | 31.39%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $3.96B     | 24.59%        |

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE           |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $29.93B     | 4.69%         |
| 2024-09-30  | $29.71B     | 3.10%         |
| 2024-06-30  | $29.38B     | 2.90%         |

| 2023-12-31  | $29.03B     | -10.88%       |


Revenue shows consistent growth over the past year. Profit margins are relatively high, but fluctuate.  ROE, while positive in recent quarters, indicates variability and was significantly negative in Q4 2023.  This requires more detailed investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly. While recent earnings show revenue growth, EPS and ROE exhibit volatility.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend, but the longer-term outlook is unclear.  The projected negative long-term return (-33%) relative to the S&P 500 presents a major concern.  Further investigation into the reasons for the Q1 2024 EPS drop and the negative ROE in Q4 2023 are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests a higher level of risk compared to a broad market index like the S&P 500.  Additional due diligence is highly recommended.
