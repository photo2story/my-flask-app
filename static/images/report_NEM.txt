## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Investment Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold and copper mining company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 31.03% for NEM, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 118.37%. The difference is -87.3%, placing it at the 6.4th percentile of the historical range of performance differences (-100.7% to 107.2%). This indicates NEM's underperformance relative to the broader market.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data reveals significant volatility in NEM's performance over different periods. While showing high CAGRs in some periods (e.g., 75% from 2019-2021), it also experienced substantial negative returns (e.g., -76% from 2021-2023).  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests that NEM has not significantly outperformed or underperformed the market adjusted for its beta, which remains consistently high (around 47). This high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values highlight the substantial risk associated with investing in NEM.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 40.0% | 28.0% | 13.0% | -0.0 | 47.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 33.0% | 25.5% | 18.0% | -0.0 | 47.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 12.0% | 22.5% | -20.0% | -0.0 | 47.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 56.0% | 24.6% | 23.0% | -0.0 | 47.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 75.0% | 24.7% | -5.0% | -0.0 | 47.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -4.0% | 52.6% | -11.0% | -0.0 | 47.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -76.0% | 52.6% | -100.0% | -0.0 | 47.0 |
| 2022-2024  | -75.0% | 56.0% | -97.0% | -0.0 | 47.0 |
| 2023-2025  | -23.0% | 38.0% | -92.0% | -0.0 | 47.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $41.67
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $40.80
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $38.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $42.09

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent period of consolidation or slight upward trend following a potentially larger downturn.  The small positive change from the previous close ($0.05) doesn't indicate any significant sudden upward or downward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.64 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.62 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but should be considered in conjunction with other indicators)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +0.9 (Suggests short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -252.2% (This extremely negative expected return over the long term is a significant red flag and needs further investigation to determine if it is accurate.)

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought, increasing the risk of a near-term price correction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue.  There's a noticeable jump in revenue and EPS in Q3 2024, but overall trends are not consistently upward.  Note that there are duplicate entries for October 24th, 2024.  Clarification on this data inconsistency is needed.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.8  | $4.61B        |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.74 | $4.40B        |
| 2024-04-29 | 0.15 | $4.02B        |
| 2023-10-26 | 0.2  | $2.49B        |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.2  | $2.49B        |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a generally upward trend, although there's a drop in Q4 2023.  Profit margins are quite high but also exhibit some fluctuation.

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $4.61B  | 36.13%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $4.40B  | 37.35%        |

| 2023-09-30  | $2.49B  | 25.75%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has shown general growth, but ROE (Return on Equity) is volatile, including a significantly negative value in Q4 2023. This volatility reflects the risk associated with the company's operations.

| Quarter     | Equity    | ROE      |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| 2024-09-30  | $29.71B   | 3.10%    |
| 2024-06-30  | $29.38B   | 2.90%    |
| 2024-03-31  | $28.89B   | 0.59%    |
| 2023-12-31  | $29.03B   | -10.88%  |
| 2023-09-30  | $19.07B   | 0.83%    |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, showing considerable volatility in both returns and profitability metrics. While revenue shows growth, the fluctuating profit margins and negative ROE in Q4 2023 raise concerns about the company's profitability and consistency.  The high beta highlights the market risk. The overbought RSI suggests potential for a price correction. The extremely negative long-term expected return (-252.2%) requires further investigation and validation.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind the large discrepancy between the expected return and historical performance before making any investment decisions.  The conflicting information regarding the October 24th, 2024, earnings data also requires clarification.  The current data suggests a high-risk investment with significant uncertainty.
