**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate varies significantly, showing periods of strong growth (2019-2021, 2023-2025) and substantial declines (2022-2024).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.  This is typical for gold mining stocks, which are often sensitive to commodity price fluctuations and broader economic conditions.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is mostly negative, suggesting NEM has underperformed relative to its risk (Beta). The last period (2023-2025) shows positive Alpha, indicating recent outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta has been increasing over time, reaching 1.7 in the last two periods. This indicates that NEM's price fluctuations are becoming more sensitive to market movements (i.e., more volatile than the market).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated, showing significant growth in the most recent period (2023-2025), likely driven by the positive CAGR in that period.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Change:** 1.96
*   **5-day SMA:** 99.56
*   **20-day SMA:** 93.06
*   **60-day SMA:** 88.60

**Analysis:** NEM's current price is above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This suggests a short-term upward trend. The price change of 1.96 indicates some volatility. The rising SMA values also confirm a recent upward price trend.

*   **Expected Return:** -40.0%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI of 75.05 indicates that the stock is currently overbought, suggesting a potential pullback may be in order.
*   A PPO of 0.75% suggests that the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, confirming a bullish trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal is a strong buy signal.
*   The positive change in divergence over the last 20 days confirms the recent upward price movement.
*   The Expected Return of -40.0% is very concerning. This suggests analysts anticipate significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Catalysts:**  Articles highlight potential tailwinds from gold prices, BofA raising the price target, and a thriving metals market.
*   **Potential Concerns:** Articles mention a stock position cut by Crocodile Capital Partners GmbH and an analysis questioning if NEM is overvalued after a surge.
*   **Company Actions:** News reports Newmont selling a stake in Fuerte Metals.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating. The average target price suggests a potential upside from the current price.

The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to ascertain immediate shifts in analyst sentiment.

*   **Conflicting Signals:** Analyst consensus is generally positive, but the significant difference between high and low target prices reveals uncertainty. Recent news is also mixed, with positive catalysts offset by concerns about valuation and position cuts.
*   **Strong Fundamentals:** Earnings and financial data indicate improving revenue, profit margins, equity, and ROE.
*    **Concerning Expected Return:** Despite the recent positive developments, the extremely negative Expected Return of -40% should be taken with high concern, especially for long-term investors.

**Conclusion:**

NEM presents a mixed picture. Recent technical indicators, earnings, and financial data suggest positive momentum, which could be seen as a short to mid term buy. However, the high volatility, historical underperformance, mixed news flow, and the particularly poor Expected Return indicate significant risks. Investors should carefully weigh these factors and conduct further due diligence before making investment decisions. The overbought RSI also suggests potential downside risk in the near term.
