## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Newmont Corporation is a leading gold mining company.  The provided data shows NEM's cumulative return significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **NEM Cumulative Return:** 46.03%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** -75.8%  (This means NEM underperformed VOO by 75.8% over the period considered).
* **Relative Divergence:** -12.0% (This places NEM's performance in the lower 12th percentile relative to its historical performance against the VOO.  It does *not* imply that NEM is 12% worse than VOO, but rather that its current underperformance is relatively low compared to its historical underperformance relative to VOO).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows mixed results with fluctuating alpha and beta values across different time periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), many show negative alpha or a significantly negative CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), indicating underperformance. The high beta in the later periods suggests higher volatility than the market. The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) numbers are very concerning, displaying substantial losses during those time frames.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 11.0% | 15.9% | -17.0% | -0.0 | 34.5 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $46.54
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $46.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $43.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $41.37

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating recent downward pressure. However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting some potential for upward movement.  The significant drop from the previous close (-2.53) indicates a notable negative change.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (73.12):**  Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, implying a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (0.79):** A positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+1.0):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative strength.

**The significant negative price change (-2.53) from the previous close suggests a potential event influencing the stock's price.**  Further investigation into news and market events is needed.

**Expected Return (-142.1%):** This extremely negative projected return against the S&P 500 is extremely concerning and requires careful scrutiny. This extremely low value warrants a detailed review of the methodology used to calculate this figure, considering the extreme pessimism inherent in this prediction.  Simply put, the model appears to have generated a highly improbable result.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue, with a noticeable increase in revenue and EPS in the last two quarters (2024-07-25 and 2024-10-24) compared to previous periods.  There is a discrepancy in the table, with the same data repeated (2024-10-24).  Clarification is needed.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.8 | $4.61 B       |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.74 | $4.40 B       |
| 2024-04-29 | 0.15 | $4.02 B       |
| 2023-10-26 | 0.2 | $2.49 B       |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.2 | $2.49 B       | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals a generally improving trend in revenue and profitability up until the last quarter. However, the ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated significantly, even showing a negative value in 2023-12-31.  This suggests potential underlying issues in the company's financial health and needs further investigation.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.61B | 36.13% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.40B | 37.35% |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.02B | 31.39% |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.96B | 24.59% |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.49B | 25.75% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $29.71B | 3.10% |
| 2024-06-30 | $29.38B | 2.90% |
| 2024-03-31 | $28.89B | 0.59% |
| 2023-12-31 | $29.03B | -10.88% |
| 2023-09-30 | $19.07B | 0.83% |



**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, showing periods of strong growth and substantial losses.  The negative expected return is particularly concerning and warrants further investigation into the model used to generate that prediction. Technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term correction, given the overbought RSI.  The recent price drop indicates a potential market event requiring further investigation. While recent earnings show an improvement, the financial data reveals volatility in ROE, signaling potential underlying issues.  Before investing, a thorough analysis of the company's fundamentals, including the causes of past underperformance and the reason for the extreme negative expected return projection, is crucial.  This analysis only presents the data; further research is necessary to form a sound investment decision.
