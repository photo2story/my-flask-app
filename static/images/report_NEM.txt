**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows significant volatility, ranging from negative values to a high of 79.0% in the most recent period (2023-2025). This suggests the stock's performance is highly sensitive to market conditions, particularly those affecting the price of gold.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is generally negative, particularly in recent periods. This means that Newmont has generally underperformed its benchmark index, even when considering its risk (Beta).  The recent period (2023-2025) showing a positive Alpha of 12% suggests improving performance relative to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** The Beta has been increasing over time, indicating that Newmont's stock price is becoming more correlated with the overall market.  A Beta consistently above 1.0 in the more recent periods (2021-2025) indicates that Newmont is more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated but saw a significant increase in the most recent period.

**Analysis:** Newmont's stock price has recently increased. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, indicating a short-term bullish trend. The recent change of 1.0 suggests a positive movement in the last trading session.

*   **RSI:** 82.47 (Overbought)

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** NEM has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, although its relative divergence is in the middle range of its historical fluctuations.
*   **Volatile Performance:** The stock exhibits significant volatility, as indicated by the high Maximum Drawdown and increasing Beta.
*   **Improving Fundamentals:** Recent earnings data, revenue, and profit margins show positive trends, reflecting improved financial performance. ROE is also increasing.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The MRI indicates a high investment recommendation, but the RSI suggests the stock is overbought. The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a positive target price, but there is a wide range of target prices. The hybrid signal and the expected return present conflicting analysis.
*   **News Analysis:** The news is mixed, with some positive catalysts (analyst upgrades, potential gold breakout) and potentially negative signals (stake reduction by Voya).

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, Newmont appears to be a potentially risky investment with some positive catalysts.  While the recent financial performance is improving and analysts generally recommend a "Buy", the stock's volatility, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and mixed signals from technical indicators suggest caution. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further research before investing in NEM. It is particularly important to investigate the conflicting data for EPS and Revenue reported on 2025-10-23.
