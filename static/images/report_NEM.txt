**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-07-25 | 0.74 | 4.40 B$ |
| 2024-04-29 | 0.15 | 4.02 B$ |

**Analysis:** The most recent earnings (2024-07-25) exceeded expectations, with EPS reaching 0.74. However, the previous two quarters showed a decline in both EPS and revenue. It's important to note that these recent declines might be influenced by fluctuating gold prices. Looking forward, the company needs to maintain or improve its earnings performance to justify the high expected return. 

**5. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has been underperforming the S&P 500 recently. While technical indicators suggest potential short-term bearish pressure, the high expected return and the recent earnings beat indicate a positive long-term outlook. However, the company needs to demonstrate consistent earnings performance to support the optimistic projection. Investors should monitor the gold market and the company's operational efficiency for a clearer picture of NEM's future trajectory.
