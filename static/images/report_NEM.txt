**Overall Analysis:**

NEM is a company with strong fundamentals, as evidenced by its latest earnings beat. The high expected return and positive technical indicators, including a recent price surge, suggest potential for continued growth in the long-term. However, the stock is currently overbought and its recent performance is lagging behind the market. Investors should monitor the stock closely for any signs of correction and consider entering at a more opportune moment. While the long-term outlook is positive, caution is advised due to the stock's overbought conditions and current underperformance against the market.
