## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold and copper producer with significant global operations.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over a specific period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons for this underperformance and assess future prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

* **NEM Cumulative Return:** 29.71%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 65.78%
* **Return Difference:** -36.1%
* **Relative Divergence:** 25.0% (This indicates NEM's underperformance is in the 25th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500, suggesting it's not an extremely unusual level of underperformance.)


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (S&P 500).  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others indicate significant negative alpha and high beta (greater volatility than the market).  This volatility is further highlighted by the maximum drawdown (MDD) figures.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates, indicating potential sensitivity to market conditions and gold prices.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $50.94
* **5-day Moving Average:** $46.74
* **20-day Moving Average:** $47.51
* **60-day Moving Average:** $44.91

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and the moving averages indicates a weak uptrend. The recent price change of +4.49 represents a sharp increase compared to the previous day's closing price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 62.18 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 0.0509 (Positive, indicating a bullish momentum, although relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -48.6% (This indicates a significant projected underperformance compared to S&P 500 over the long-term. This figure should be treated with caution given the high degree of uncertainty in long-term market predictions).

The significant price increase of $4.49 reflects a substantial daily jump, possibly due to market news or unforeseen events. This needs further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has shown inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500. While recent price action shows a potential short-term uptrend, the long-term outlook is uncertain due to the highly volatile nature of gold prices and the company's past performance. The significant negative expected return (-48.6%) compared to the S&P 500 raises concerns for long-term investors.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the large daily price jump and the fluctuations in EPS and ROE.  A more in-depth analysis, including examination of the gold market and macroeconomic factors, would be necessary to provide a more comprehensive assessment of NEM's investment potential. The data inconsistencies need to be resolved before drawing definitive conclusions.  This report is a preliminary assessment based solely on the provided limited data.
