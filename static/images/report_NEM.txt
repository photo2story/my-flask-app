The large negative Alpha values in recent years suggest considerable underperformance relative to the market.

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $52.66
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $48.82

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but below the 20-day moving average.  This suggests a potential for short-term upward momentum, but caution is advised as the price is still below the 20-day average. The last market data shows a positive change, which is a good sign.

**3. Market Risk and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3475 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 37.10 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -1.33

*   **Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk. The RSI is close to oversold, which could signal a potential rebound.  However, the negative PPO and significant negative expected return suggest caution. The recent decline in relative disparity reinforces the negative short-term trend. The price increasing from $49.84 to $50.10 may suggest a brief bullish movement, it is not substantial enough to offset the long-term negative expectations.
