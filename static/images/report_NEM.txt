**7. Overall Assessment**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) presents a mixed picture.

Recent news also includes a delisting from the TSX and price target adjustments, which could create uncertainty. The long-term expected return is modest.

**Recommendation:** A cautious approach is warranted. While the company's financials are improving, the underperformance relative to the market and overbought condition suggest potential risks. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing in NEM. The Hybrid signal also suggests a cautious approach to buying (buy only 80% of available shares).
