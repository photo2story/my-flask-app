The earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally increased, EPS shows inconsistency, with a notable decline in Q1 2024. The duplication of the Oct 2024 data point requires clarification.  A more comprehensive analysis requires additional data and a deeper dive into the company's operational and market conditions.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.8 | 4.61 B$ |

**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows a positive trend, although the profit margin fluctuates, showing decline in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.  Equity has also shown inconsistency.  ROE (Return on Equity) is highly volatile and indicates periods of both profitability and significant losses. Further analysis is required to understand the underlying drivers of this volatility.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, showing considerable volatility and a high maximum drawdown.  While some periods showed positive growth, recent performance has been poor. Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction despite recent price increases.  The projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  A thorough investigation into the factors driving the negative alpha and the methodology behind the -188.4% expected return is critical before making any investment decisions.  Furthermore, the inconsistent financial data requires further examination to understand the underlying causes and implications.  Additional data and a deeper fundamental analysis are needed for a more comprehensive assessment.
