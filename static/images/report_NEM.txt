* **Technical Analysis**: The RSI approaching overbought territory could mean an imminent correction.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, a cautious approach to Newmont is warranted. Investors should closely monitor upcoming news and earnings reports to assess the company's ability to improve its performance and address the concerns raised by the technical indicators and financial metrics. The large underperformance versus the S&P500, combined with the very negative projected return, warrants serious consideration before investing.
