## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Analysis

Newmont Corporation is the world's leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc and lead.

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **NEM Cumulative Return:** 68.39%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 96.68%
*   **Absolute Performance Difference:** -28.29% (NEM underperformed VOO by this amount)
*   **Performance Gap (Max: 63.1, Min: -94.8, Current: -39.1, Relative Position: 35.3)** This means that, relative to its historical range of underperformance/outperformance vs the S&P 500, NEM is currently positioned in the lower end. Historically, it has performed much better relative to the S&P 500 at times.

**Analysis of Provided Alpha/Beta Data Table:**

The table presents rolling 3-year periods and provides key performance metrics.  Here's a breakdown of the key columns:

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  This shows the average annual growth rate over the 3-year period.  Note the wide range, from positive to significantly negative.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** This represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. The MDD is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:**  This measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). Negative alpha indicates underperformance. The alpha values are consistently negative, and in some periods, significantly so.
*   **Beta:** This measures the investment's volatility relative to the benchmark.  A beta of 1 means the investment moves in line with the benchmark.  A beta greater than 1 means it's more volatile.  The Beta is high and increasing, suggesting NEM has become more volatile relative to the market.
*   **Cap(B) - Capitalization in Billions:** Shows the company's market cap during that period.

**Key Takeaways from Table:**

*   **Underperformance:** The consistent negative Alpha is a major concern, suggesting that NEM has struggled to deliver returns above the benchmark.
*   **High Volatility:** The high MDD values and the increasing Beta point to NEM being a volatile investment.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 89.40
*   **Last Market Data:** Price increased by 5.0 compared to the previous close of 85.14, indicating a significant single-day jump.
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 86.97
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 84.45
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 74.62

**Analysis:**

*   The price is above all three moving averages, which is generally a bullish signal.
*   The recent price surge is substantial and needs further investigation (news, earnings, etc.).

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expectations

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI:** 61.59 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** -0.38 (Slightly below zero, indicating potential weakness but nearing a crossover)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). This is a model output suggesting a strong buy signal.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Performance Change:** -2.1 (Negative, indicates a recent decline in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return:** -70.3% (Significantly negative, indicating projected underperformance vs. S&P 500 over the long term with a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy.)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI is nearing overbought levels, which could indicate a potential pullback.
*   The PPO is close to crossing over to positive, which could be a bullish sign, but it's still negative.
*   The Hybrid Signal contradicts the other signals and the expected return.
*   The negative relative performance change is concerning and aligns with the long-term underperformance.
*   The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.  It suggests that, even with dollar-cost averaging, the model predicts significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**The significant price increase of 5.0** reflects a potentially important development (positive news, earnings surprise, etc.). It's crucial to understand the reason behind this jump. The negative 20-day Relative Performance Change is counterintuitive and needs further investigation.
### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Goldman Sachs Upgrade:**  This is a positive catalyst that likely contributed to the recent price increase.
*   **New Orleans Investment Conference (Thunderstruck Resources):**  Indirectly relevant; could indicate increased investor interest in the gold/resource sector.

**Analysis:**
