**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Newmont Corporation is a leading global gold producer.  Over the reviewed period, NEM underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by 34.67%, significantly lagging behind the market benchmark.  The relative divergence suggests this underperformance is within the historical range, but relatively toward the lower end.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and beta (volatility relative to the market).  While some periods show positive alpha, others indicate significant negative alpha, particularly in more recent years. The beta has increased noticeably over time indicating increasing sensitivity to market movements, especially in recent periods.  The consistent decline in CAGR and increasing negative alpha over the last few years is a significant concern.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures also highlight the significant risk associated with investing in NEM.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 33.0% | 26.5% | 4.0% | 0.0 | 34.0 |

**2. Recent Price Action:**

The stock price is currently trading slightly below its recent 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price decrease of -$0.33 (Last-market data) signals a minor negative shift, but it is not significant enough to be considered a sharp drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI value of 70.52 indicates that the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.  The positive PPO value supports the bullish momentum but should be viewed cautiously given the other indicators. The recent increase in relative strength (+1.2) suggests short-term upward movement. The projected long-term expected return (-47.1%) is significantly negative compared to the S&P 500, raising concerns about long-term investment prospects.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue figures. While revenue generally increased, EPS shows volatility, with a significant drop in Q1 2024. This inconsistency warrants further investigation into the underlying drivers of profitability. The repeated entry for Oct 24, 2024, needs clarification.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.8 | 4.61 B$ |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.74 | 4.40 B$ |
| 2024-04-29 | 0.15 | 4.02 B$ |
| 2023-10-26 | 0.2 | 2.49 B$ |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.2 | 2.49 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows a relatively stable equity level, but inconsistent profitability. While revenue shows a general upward trend, profit margins have fluctuated significantly. ROE is generally low and negative in one period, indicating potential concerns about profitability and return on investment.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $5.65B | 45.51% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While some periods exhibit positive growth and alpha, the recent trend shows declining performance, high volatility (indicated by beta and MDD), and a negative long-term expected return.  The technical indicators suggest potential short-term upward movement, but the overall picture indicates a need for caution.  The inconsistent earnings and fluctuating profit margins further reinforce the concerns.  Before considering a long-term investment in NEM, a deeper dive into the company’s future growth prospects, operational efficiency, and potential risks is crucial.  The current data raises serious questions about the long-term viability of this investment, especially given the negative expected return relative to the market.
