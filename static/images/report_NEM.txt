This report analyzes NEM's recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering its price movements, financial indicators, and earnings data.  The analysis reveals significant underperformance against the market benchmark, although recent earnings show growth.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM), a leading gold producer, shows a cumulative return of 11.22% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 89.44%.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values over the years.  While alpha is mostly near zero, indicating performance roughly in line with the market, 2023-2025 shows an unusually high alpha (1.9). This may suggest a period of outperformance, but it is crucial to note that a single year's performance is not indicative of consistent behavior. Beta, representing market volatility sensitivity, has also been erratic, suggesting varied correlation with the overall market across different time periods. High beta values indicate higher risk.  Capitalization (Cap) has shown a generally upward trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.8   | $4.61B        |

| 2024-10-24 | $0.2   | $2.49B        |

There's a discrepancy in the October 24th data. Assuming this is a duplicate entry, the data shows a clear increase in both EPS and revenue in the most recent quarters, although this is partially due to seasonal variations that might impact gold demand.  Further investigation is needed to confirm the data accuracy.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NEM's recent financial performance shows improvements in revenue and profitability. However, its significant underperformance against the S&P 500 (-78.2%) and a projected negative long-term return relative to the market raise significant concerns. The high RSI suggests an overbought condition, and the negative long-term expected return requires careful consideration. While recent earnings show positive trends, investors need to carefully weigh these positive factors against the considerable underperformance compared to the broader market and the relatively high risk associated with the stock's volatility.  Further in-depth fundamental analysis is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The discrepancy in the October 24th earnings data also requires clarification.
