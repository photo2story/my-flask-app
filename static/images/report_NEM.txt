## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading global gold and copper mining company.  As of the last data point, NEM's cumulative return is 22.95%, significantly lagging the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 112.20%.  The difference is -89.2%, placing it at the 5.5th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data reveals significant volatility in NEM's performance over time, ranging from a high of 76% to a low of -76%.  Alpha consistently shows near zero, suggesting the stock's returns are primarily driven by market movements (Beta fluctuates between 32 and 64, reflecting sensitivity to market fluctuations). Market capitalization has shown some growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $39.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $38.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $38.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $43.39

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a notable price decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.77 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.82 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -285.8% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significant projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon of 2+ years.  This figure requires further scrutiny to determine its accuracy and underlying assumptions.)

The current price of $39.10, being below the moving averages, does not indicate a sudden, dramatic price movement (either up or down). However, the significant negative expected return warrants careful consideration.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.80  | $4.61B        |
| 2024-07-25 | $0.74  | $4.40B        |
| 2024-04-29 | $0.15  | $4.02B        |
| 2023-10-26 | $0.20  | $2.49B        |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.20  | $2.49B        | *(Duplicate entry - likely an error)*

There's a clear increase in both EPS and revenue from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, but the Q2 2024 numbers show a significant drop in EPS, which needs further investigation. The duplicate entry for October 24th, 2024, requires clarification.  A deeper analysis of the underlying factors driving these fluctuations is necessary.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.61B  | 36.13%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.40B  | 37.35%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.02B  | 31.39%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.96B  | 24.59%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.49B  | 25.75%       |

Revenue shows a generally upward trend, with strong profit margins, although there is some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE       |
|---------|----------|------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $29.71B | 3.10%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $29.38B | 2.90%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $28.89B | 0.59%      |
| 2023-12-31 | $29.03B | -10.88%    |
| 2023-09-30 | $19.07B | 0.83%      |

Equity has generally increased, but ROE shows significant variability, including a substantial negative value in Q4 2023.  This needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM shows mixed signals. While revenue and profit margins are generally positive, the stock's significant underperformance against the S&P 500, negative long-term expected return, and volatile ROE raise concerns.  The price is currently below its moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this underperformance is a temporary blip or a reflection of deeper underlying issues within the company.  The provided -285.8% expected return is exceptionally negative and needs verification. The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry, sudden EPS drop) also warrant further investigation before making any investment decisions.  Due diligence and additional research are crucial before investing in NEM.
