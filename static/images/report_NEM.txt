**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, indicated by a negative alpha and a large negative divergence. While recent earnings show improvement, the stock price is currently below its moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The -173.7% long-term expected return is highly questionable and needs clarification.  The high beta indicates high market sensitivity.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough investigation into the causes of the recent price drop and the extremely negative long-term expected return is crucial.  Further research into industry trends and the company's future prospects is recommended.  The data provided contains inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) that require clarification.
