**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM shows strong recent quarterly earnings, with significant revenue and EPS growth. However, its substantial underperformance against the S&P 500 over various periods, as evidenced by the consistently negative alpha, is a major concern.  The extremely negative long-term expected return against the S&P 500 raises serious doubts about its investment potential. The negative ROE in Q4 2023 requires further investigation. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with some suggesting upward momentum, while others indicate bearish trends.  More information is needed on recent news and analyst opinions to form a comprehensive assessment.  The provided data alone does not support a bullish outlook for NEM in the long term compared to the S&P 500.
