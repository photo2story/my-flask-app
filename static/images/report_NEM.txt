**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 21.0%   | 62.5% | -8.0%  | -0.1 | 41.2  |
| 2016-2018  | 16.0%   | 68.9% | 1.0%   | 0.0  | 38.1  |
| 2017-2019  | -7.0%   | 71.3% | -29.0% | 0.4  | 47.8  |
| 2018-2020  | 7.0%    | 72.6% | -16.0% | 0.4  | 65.8  |
| 2019-2021  | 43.0%   | 72.6% | -4.0%  | 0.7  | 68.2  |
| 2020-2022  | -14.0%  | 80.0% | -13.0% | 0.9  | 51.9  |
| 2021-2023  | -27.0%  | 80.0% | -29.0% | 1.5  | 45.5  |
| 2022-2024  | -58.0%  | 74.9% | -79.0% | 1.7  | 40.9  |
| 2023-2025  | 51.0%   | 79.1% | -14.0% | 1.7  | 99.4  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Fluctuates significantly, indicating volatile performance. It has shown both strong positive and negative growth periods. The recent 2023-2025 period shows a strong positive growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high, implying substantial risk and potential for significant losses.  MDD is the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained.
*   **Alpha:**  Predominantly negative, suggesting underperformance compared to its benchmark after adjusting for risk. This means Newmont hasn't been generating excess returns relative to its risk exposure.
*   **Beta:**  Has increased over time, indicating that Newmont's price movements have become more sensitive to overall market movements (S&P 500). The high recent beta values (1.5 and 1.7) indicate a higher correlation and volatility relative to the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):**  Fluctuates, reflecting market valuation changes. The increase in 2023-2025 indicates a recent resurgence in market capitalization.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 90.375
*   **Last-Market:** price: 90.491, previousClose: 90.48, change: 0.01
*   **5-day SMA:** 89.631
*   **20-day SMA:** 86.9752
*   **60-day SMA:** 85.3152

**Analysis:**

The stock price (90.375) is trading above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day simple moving averages (SMAs). This *could* be interpreted as a short-term bullish signal.  The slight increase in the 'last-market' figures could reflect small intraday volatility, but is not necessarily a meaningful movement in and of itself.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.82 (Neutral - not overbought or oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.4779 (Positive - slightly above the signal line)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 4.8 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -62.0 (Negative - significant underperformance expected)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment Recommended" risk level, implying that the model views the stock as reasonably safe, especially given the high score of 0.9.
*   The RSI of 50.82 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The PPO being positive could indicate a slight upward momentum.
*   The 'Hybrid Signal' recommends buying, suggesting a positive outlook based on the model's analysis, and points out that there is no need to retain any cash.
*   The "short-term increase" in relative divergence suggests a recent positive trend in NEM's performance *relative* to the S&P 500, but that's only for the last 20 days.
*   The **very concerning** "Expected Return" of -62.0% suggests a *significant* underperformance is anticipated if holding the stock for over two years. This contradicts the 'Medium Investment Recommended' classification and the positive Hybrid Signal, and is a red flag.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Trending Stock:** Some articles highlight Newmont as a "trending stock," which might attract speculative interest.
*   **Sector Leadership:** One article questions whether Newmont will benefit from sector leadership, indicating a potential positive catalyst.
*   **Stock Down:** One article notes a recent 3% drop, highlighting short-term volatility.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** An article discusses Newmont's record free cash flow momentum potentially carrying into Q4, which is a positive sign.
*   **Big Money Piling In:** An article mentions significant investment after a substantial year-to-date rally.
*   **Outperforming Sector:** An article explores whether Newmont is outperforming the Basic Materials sector, which suggests relative strength within its industry.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. There are elements of positive news like increasing free cash flow and some recognition of momentum. However, the volatility and a recent price decline are also mentioned. It's important to critically assess the claims in these articles.  "Trending stock" can often attract speculative money, which can be a risk.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.71)
*   **Opinions:** 20
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 104.53 / 124.68 / 62.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes provided.

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is a "Buy," which is generally positive. The average target price of $104.53 suggests potential upside from the current price (~90). However, the low target price of $62 indicates a wide range of opinions and potential downside risk.  Without the recent rating changes themselves, it's impossible to determine if sentiment is improving or worsening.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출    |
|------------|------|---------|
| 2025-10-23 | 1.67 | 5.52 B$ |
| 2025-07-24 | 1.86 | 5.32 B$ |
| 2025-04-24 | 1.68 | 5.01 B$ |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.8  | 4.61 B$ |
| 2025-10-23 | 0.8  | 4.61 B$ |

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS has generally increased over the past year.
*   **매출 (Revenue):** Revenue has also generally increased over the past year.

This suggests positive growth in both profitability and revenue.  However, the duplication of the final row is a data error and is confusing.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $5.52B   | 53.04%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $5.32B   | 50.71%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $5.01B   | 46.13%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $5.65B   | 45.51%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $4.61B   | 36.13%        |

**Analysis:** Revenue and profit margins have generally increased recently, indicating improving business performance. The most recent quarter (2025-09-30) shows the highest revenue and profit margin in the given period.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE   |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| 2025-09-30   | $33.23B  | 5.51% |
| 2025-06-30   | $32.11B  | 6.42% |
| 2025-03-31   | $31.25B  | 6.05% |
| 2024-12-31   | $29.93B  | 4.69% |
| 2024-09-30   | $29.71B  | 3.10% |

**Analysis:** Equity has steadily increased, indicating a growing asset base. ROE (Return on Equity) has also increased, reflecting improved profitability relative to shareholder equity. However, ROE has decreased recently, which is a negative development.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

**Overall Assessment:**

Newmont Corporation presents a mixed picture.

*   **Positive Indicators:**
    *   Recent positive trend in revenue, EPS, and profit margins.
    *   Analyst consensus is generally "Buy."
    *   Increase of MRI recently.
    *   Recent increase in free cash flow (as per news articles).
    *   Short-term increase in relative divergence (relative to S&P 500).
*   **Negative Indicators:**
    *   Significant historical underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High maximum drawdown, indicating substantial risk.
    *   Negative Alpha, suggesting a historical failure to generate excess returns relative to risk.
    *   A high beta, making it very sensitive to market fluctuations.
    *   The **extremely concerning** Expected Return of -62.0%. This cannot be ignored and contradicts many other data points, suggesting potentially flawed underlying assumptions in its calculation.
    *   The analyst target price range has a very wide range, implying uncertainty in the future of the stock.

**Recommendation:**

Due to the extremely low expected return, substantial risk, and high beta, investing in this stock is not recommended.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Conflicting Signals:** The Hybrid Signal and MRI rating of "Medium Investment Recommended" contradict the negative expected return and underperformance of the analysis of cumulative return, alpha, and beta.
*   **Gold Price Sensitivity:** Newmont's performance is likely highly correlated with the price of gold. This analysis doesn't explicitly account for gold price forecasts.
*   **Data Validity:** Verify the accuracy of the provided data, especially the duplicate row in the EPS table and the negative expected return.

The extremely low expected return should be thoroughly investigated before making any investment decisions. This strongly suggests a flawed model or very pessimistic future expectations for Newmont.
