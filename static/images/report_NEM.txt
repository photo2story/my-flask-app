**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported earnings show a mixed picture. Revenue has generally increased over the past few quarters but the EPS fluctuates considerably.  While revenue shows growth from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024 ($2.49B to $4.61B), EPS decreased sequentially (from $0.8 in Q3 2024 to $0.74 in Q2 2024 and $0.15 in Q1 2024). There's no information to compare results against expectations, preventing an assessment of beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows strong growth in recent quarters, but profit margins fluctuate and have decreased slightly from Q2 2024 ($37.35%) to Q3 2024 ($36.13%).
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows growth generally, though there's a significant drop between Q2 2023 ($19.07B) and Q4 2023 ($29.03B). ROE has been highly variable and even negative in Q4 2023.  This inconsistency highlights the inherent risks within the gold mining industry.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news (within the last two days) concerning earnings announcements, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which has not been provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, showing a substantial negative divergence.  While recent revenue growth is positive, erratic EPS and ROE figures, along with negative technical indicators (RSI, PPO) and a negative relative strength divergence point towards a bearish sentiment. The projection of 0% expected return versus the S&P 500 further reinforces the lack of strong positive outlook for NEM in the given data.  More information on recent news and analyst sentiment would be needed for a more comprehensive assessment.  The provided data highlights the volatile nature of gold mining stocks and the need for careful risk management for any investment consideration.
