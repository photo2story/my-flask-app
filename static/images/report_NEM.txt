## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Investment Review

This report analyzes Newmont Corporation (NEM), a leading gold and copper producer, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Newmont's cumulative return (18.15%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (117.62%) over the analyzed period.  The provided data shows a large negative divergence (-99.5), indicating NEM's substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.  The relative divergence of 0.9 suggests that this underperformance is near the lower bound of the historical range of divergence between NEM and the S&P 500.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $37.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $37.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $39.11
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $44.30

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages implies a recent slowdown in the price decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (34.79):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (0.33):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+0.2):** Suggests a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (-1643.7%):** This extremely negative value indicates a significantly negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This prediction warrants careful consideration and scrutiny of its underlying assumptions.  The extremely low expected return likely reflects the substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 observed in the historical data.  The current price of $37.79 doesn't inherently signal a sudden price surge or drop; rather, its position below various moving averages points towards continued downward pressure unless significant market shifts occur.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture:

* **Revenue:** Revenue generally increased from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, peaking at $4.61B. There's a noticeable drop in revenue from $4.61B (Q3 2024) to $4.40B (Q2 2024) and further down to $4.02B (Q1 2024) and $2.49B (Q4 2023).

* **EPS:** EPS also fluctuates, with a noticeable rise from $0.15 (Q1 2024) to $0.74 (Q2 2024) and $0.8 (Q3 2024), followed by a previous value of $0.2 (Q4 2023).  The repetition of the $0.2 entry for Q4 2023 and Q4 2024 is contradictory and requires clarification from the original data source.

* **Profitability:** The inconsistency in the reported Q4 2023 and Q4 2024 data makes definitive conclusions about trends difficult.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows growth trends, particularly from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024. However,  profit margins fluctuate, suggesting variability in profitability despite revenue increases.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity generally increased, but Return on Equity (ROE) is highly volatile, ranging from a significant loss (-10.88%) in Q4 2023 to a positive but low value of 3.10% in Q3 2024. This suggests some instability in the company's profitability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500.  While recent quarterly revenue growth is positive, the EPS and profitability trends are volatile and the contradictory Q4 2023 and Q4 2024 data requires clarification.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 casts significant doubt on the investment potential.  Further research is needed to assess the accuracy of the negative expected return and to gain insight from recent news and analyst opinions before any investment decision is made.  The provided data alone does not strongly support an investment in NEM.
