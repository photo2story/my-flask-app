## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold and copper producer.  This report analyzes NEM's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial data to assess its current standing and potential future returns.  NEM's recent performance has lagged the S&P 500, showing signs of both strength and weakness depending on the indicator considered.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading global gold and copper mining company.

* **NEM Cumulative Return:** 48.11%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 72.42%
* **Return Difference:** -24.3%
* **Relative Divergence:** 32.1% (This means NEM's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is in the 32nd percentile of its historical range of under/outperformance.)


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO). While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others show significant negative alpha, especially in the most recent years (2021-2025). The beta values indicate fluctuating sensitivity to market movements. Notably, the high negative CAGR in recent years (-37% to -70%) is concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $55.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $55.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $49.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.27

The stock price is currently trading above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day MA indicates a recent period of stability. The larger difference between the closing price and the 20-day and 60-day MAs shows that the recent upward trend is building upon a longer-term period of lower prices.  The last market data shows a minor positive change ($0.24), indicating a relatively modest increase.


**3. Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 68.68 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.33 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.9 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -27.8% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 significantly over the long term)

The RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought, potentially indicating a short-term correction might be on the horizon. The positive PPO confirms short-term upward momentum. However, the negative expected return suggests a potential for underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term. The recent price increase is not drastic enough to be labeled a 'sudden surge'.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.8 | $4.61 Billion |
| 2024-07-25 | $0.74| $4.40 Billion |
| 2024-04-29 | $0.15| $4.02 Billion |
| 2023-10-26 | $0.2 | $2.49 Billion |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.2 | $2.49 Billion | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


Earnings have been fluctuating, with significant growth in EPS and revenue from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024. However, there's a considerable drop in EPS in Q2 2024, and the duplication in the October 24th data needs clarification.  Further investigation is needed to understand the variations in profitability across quarters.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2024-09-30  | $4.61 Billion | 36.13%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $4.40 Billion | 37.35%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $4.02 Billion | 31.39%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $3.96 Billion | 24.59%        |

| 2024-12-31  | $29.93 Billion | 4.69%         |
| 2024-09-30  | $29.71 Billion | 3.10%         |

| 2023-12-31  | $29.03 Billion | -10.88%       |


Revenue shows consistent growth, while profit margins fluctuate.  The ROE also shows volatility, including a negative value in Q4 2023.  This indicates the company's profitability is inconsistent, and it's crucial to understand the reasons for these fluctuations.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NEM's recent performance has been mixed. While the stock price shows a short-term upward trend and some positive indicators, its long-term performance lags the S&P 500, with significant negative expected returns.  The inconsistent earnings and ROE values raise concerns about the company's financial stability and profitability.  Further investigation is necessary to understand the drivers behind the fluctuating performance and to assess whether the recent price increase is sustainable.  Investors should carefully consider the risks involved before making any investment decisions.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings report) also highlight the need for more reliable and verified data before drawing definitive conclusions.
