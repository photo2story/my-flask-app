*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Alpha:** Newmont has consistently underperformed the market (negative alpha) in most periods except for 2016-2018 and 2023-2025. This suggests NEM's returns haven't justified the risk taken relative to the market.
    *   **Beta:** The beta has been increasing over time, indicating the stock has become more sensitive to market movements. A beta of 1.7 in the most recent period (2023-2025) suggests it's significantly more volatile than the S&P 500.
    *   **CAGR:**  Fluctuating CAGR values indicate volatile performance.
    *   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures suggest high risk and potential for significant losses during downturns.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 105.78
*   **Last Market Data:** price: 99.81, previousClose: 105.78, change: -5.64
*   **Simple Moving Averages (SMAs):**
    *   5-day SMA: 104.386
    *   20-day SMA: 96.749
    *   60-day SMA: 89.9586

*   **Analysis:** The recent price drop is significant. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA.  This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but the sharp price decrease on the last market could reverse the trend.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 82.47 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.7477

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 3.6 (+) indicating a recent short-term increase.
*   **Expected Return:** -40.0% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:** The RSI indicates the stock is overbought, suggesting a potential pullback. The MRI suggests that, despite the risk, investment is recommended. The hybrid signal suggests buying, allocating all cash to the investment. The expected return is very negative (-40.0%), indicating that, from this point, investment is not expected to do well compared to S&P 500 over the long term.
