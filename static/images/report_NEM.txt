## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM), a leading gold mining company, shows a cumulative return of 35.5% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 121.1% over the analyzed period.  This results in a significant divergence of -85.6%, placing it in the 7.3rd percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500.  This indicates NEM significantly underperformed the broader market. The provided alpha consistently shows near zero values suggesting the returns weren't significantly better or worse than the market after adjusting for beta, but beta fluctuates and shows considerable sensitivity to market conditions.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $43.09
* **5-day Moving Average:** $41.93
* **20-day Moving Average:** $40.38
* **60-day Moving Average:** $41.01

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent price surge, though it's important to consider the relatively short period represented by the moving averages.  The strong price movement from the previous close ($41.59) is approximately a 3.6% increase, reflecting a recent significant uptick.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 79.38 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a pullback)
* **PPO:** 0.77 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -231.8% (This dramatically negative expected return suggests that even with long-term investment, NEM is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over two years. This prediction should be treated with caution; it relies on uncertain future projections.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.80  | $4.61B      |
| 2024-07-25 | $0.74  | $4.40B      |
| 2024-04-29 | $0.15  | $4.02B      |
| 2023-10-26 | $0.20  | $2.49B      |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.20  | $2.49B      | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings show significant fluctuation.  The two October 24th entries appear to be duplicates.  Revenue is generally increasing, but EPS volatility warrants further investigation into the underlying factors influencing profitability.  The significant increase in EPS and revenue in Q3 2024 is noteworthy and may warrant further scrutiny.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.61B     | 36.13%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.40B     | 37.35%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.02B     | 31.39%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.96B     | 24.59%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.49B     | 25.75%        |

Revenue shows a clear upward trend, particularly in the last two quarters, while profit margin is also generally increasing although it fluctuates.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE       |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $29.71B    | 3.10%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $29.38B    | 2.90%     |
| 2024-03-31 | $28.89B    | 0.59%     |
| 2023-12-31 | $29.03B    | -10.88%   |
| 2023-09-30 | $19.07B    | 0.83%     |

Equity shows consistent growth.  ROE, however, is highly volatile, indicating significant shifts in profitability.  The negative ROE in Q4 2023 is a significant concern.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's recent performance has been mixed. While revenue and, in some periods, profit margins have been increasing, the stock's overall return significantly lags the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest overbought conditions, raising caution.  The highly volatile EPS and ROE figures, coupled with the extremely negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500, indicate considerable risk.  Further investigation is needed into the causes of the EPS and ROE volatility and the underlying assumptions of the negative long-term expected return.  The data suggests that while there might be near-term growth potential, the long-term outlook for outperforming the market appears significantly unfavorable based on the available data.  Investors should proceed with caution.  Independent research and a thorough risk assessment are crucial before making any investment decisions.
