## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Investment Review

This report analyzes Newmont Corporation (NEM), a leading gold and copper mining company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Newmont's cumulative return of 40.6% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return of 128.86%.  The difference is -88.3%, placing it at the 4.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided Alpha values consistently show outperformance relative to the market benchmark, suggesting this lag is not a consistent trend.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $42.04
* **5-day Moving Average:** $42.69
* **20-day Moving Average:** $43.29
* **60-day Moving Average:** $50.00

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (32.47):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (0.55):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-10.6%):** Shows a recent decline in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return is zero. This is likely a placeholder, as accurately projecting long-term returns is challenging. Without further details on the methodology used to calculate this expected return, it should be treated cautiously.  Based on the historical data, long-term returns may well be tied to the price of gold and the company's ability to generate profits in a volatile commodities market.

The closing price of $42.01 is close to the 5-day and 20-day moving average,  but well below the 60-day average, making a dramatic price movement (up or down) less likely in the immediate future barring unexpected news.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals a mixed picture:

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows strong growth from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, reaching $4.61B. However there is evidence of sequential quarterly decline in the last two quarters of 2024, after a significant surge in the prior quarter.
* **EPS:** EPS experienced significant volatility.  A sharp increase from Q1 2024 to Q2 and Q3 2024 is observed.
* **Profit Margin:** Shows a mixed trend, peaking at 37.35% in Q2 2024,  but showing a decline recently.

The data doesn't provide information to compare actual results against expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue growth is apparent, although recent quarters show some decrease in sequential growth. Profit margins fluctuated but generally remain healthy despite recent decline.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has seen some volatility. ROE is highly volatile, with significant negative values observed in Q4 2023.  These fluctuations highlight the cyclical nature of the mining industry.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Further information would significantly enhance this analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Newmont (NEM) shows signs of underlying strength in revenue and profit margins (with some recent dips) and has historically outperformed the market based on Alpha values. However, recent price action suggests a bearish short-term outlook. The significant underperformance against the S&P 500 in the past period is a major concern, though the provided data suggests the current position may be an opportunity given the oversold indicators.  Further research into the specific causes for recent dips in profit margins and EPS and the current market outlook, along with any significant news or analyst opinions, is crucial for a complete evaluation.  The lack of context for the 0.0% expected return makes it impossible to use this metric in the analysis.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the limited information, a strong buy or sell recommendation cannot be made.  Further investigation into recent news, analyst sentiment, and a more detailed explanation of the 0.0% expected return are necessary.  The oversold RSI and the historical Alpha values suggest a potential buying opportunity, but the price action and recent earnings dip indicate a degree of caution.  A thorough analysis of the company's future gold and copper price forecasts and operational efficiency is warranted before making an investment decision.
