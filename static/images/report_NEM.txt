**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance has been inconsistent relative to the S&P 500.  While showing periods of strong outperformance, it has also experienced substantial underperformance and significant losses recently.  The recent price drop and the negative expected return signal caution.  Further investigation is crucial to understand the underlying causes of the volatility and the -40.3% expected return projection.  A detailed review of the company's financial statements, industry trends, and macroeconomic factors impacting gold and copper prices is necessary for a comprehensive assessment.  The data provided has inconsistencies (duplicate earnings data) that need clarification before drawing definitive conclusions.  The negative expected return projection needs additional justification and context.
