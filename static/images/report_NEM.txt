## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold and copper mining company.  As of the last reported date, NEM's cumulative return is 39.57%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which shows a cumulative return of 129.75%. The difference is -90.2%, placing it at the 4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in NEM's performance over the years, ranging from a high of 82% to a low of -69%.  The beta consistently hovers around 0, suggesting very low correlation with the overall market.  This low beta is likely a result of the gold sector's inherent counter-cyclical nature.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $42.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $49.24

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.71 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.51 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though relatively weak)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:**  Nan (-), indicating recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term, based on the provided data). The current price of $41.56 doesn't significantly trigger any immediate alarms (e.g., sharp uptrend or downtrend); however, the recent decline, as reflected in the moving averages and relative divergence, should be noted.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS. While revenue generally increased from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, the EPS shows significant variation, with a notable drop in Q1 2024.  There is no information about expected earnings to compare actual performance against.   Profit margins were highest in Q2 2024 and decreased through the following quarters.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows a significant increase in Q3 2024, followed by a small decline in Q4 2024. This indicates seasonality or cyclical influences within the business.
* **Profit Margin:** Fluctuated considerably, reaching a high of 37.35% in Q2 2024 and falling to 36.13% in Q3 2024. The sharp decline in Q4 2023 and subsequent recovery suggest potential market-specific factors influencing profitability.
* **Equity and ROE:**  Equity shows fluctuations, but ROE shows significant volatility, including a substantial negative value in Q4 2023. This highlights the risk associated with NEM's operations.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook or analyst opinions were provided.  This section requires additional information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 in recent periods.  While the company shows some signs of revenue growth and profitability, the high volatility in both revenue, EPS, profit margins, and ROE raises concerns. The low beta suggests limited correlation with the broader market, which may be beneficial during market downturns but could limit upside potential. Technical indicators show a neutral to slightly positive momentum but with a recent short-term downtrend. The lack of information on analyst opinions and recent news prevents a more complete assessment.  More detailed information is needed to fully evaluate the investment prospects of NEM. Further investigation into the factors driving the volatility and the company's future growth plans is recommended before making any investment decisions.
