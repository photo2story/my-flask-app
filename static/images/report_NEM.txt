**0) Overview**

We'll start with the raw data, move to simpler analysis, and then provide a more in-depth summary.

**1) Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **NEM Company Overview:** Newmont Corporation is the world's leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc and lead.
