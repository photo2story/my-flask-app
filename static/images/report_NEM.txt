* **NEM Cumulative Return:** 34.33%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 119.91%

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance for NEM over different periods. While some periods exhibited strong returns (e.g., 2019-2021: 76%), others show significant losses (e.g., 2021-2023: -64%).  Alpha values generally indicate underperformance relative to the market (Beta >1 shows higher volatility than the benchmark) with the exception of 2021-2023 and 2022-2025.

* **60-day Moving Average:** $40.98

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the long term, but recent quarters show improved revenue and profitability. Technical indicators suggest potential short-term upward momentum, but the RSI is approaching overbought levels. The extremely negative projected long-term return (-233.5%) is a major concern and needs to be thoroughly investigated.  Further analysis is needed to reconcile the conflicting signals from various indicators.  More data, particularly the methodology behind the -233.5% expected return and clarification on some data inconsistencies, are crucial for a more comprehensive and reliable analysis. The high volatility (Beta > 1) of NEM also highlights the risk involved in investing in the stock.
