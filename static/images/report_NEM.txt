This report analyzes Newmont Corporation (NEM), a leading gold producer, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Newmont Corporation's cumulative return (45.08%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (127.58%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -82.5%, placing it at the 7.6th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $43.38 (Last Market: $42.12)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $43.05
* **20-day Moving Average:** $44.11
* **60-day Moving Average:** $50.49

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average highlights the recent decline. The slight increase from the last market close suggests a minor upward correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

* **RSI (38.1):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 40), suggesting potential for a short-term bounce.
* **PPO (0.49):**  Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-10.42):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength against the benchmark, confirming the downtrend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data indicates zero expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  This should be viewed cautiously as a prediction for a future period. A more detailed analysis is needed for a reliable forecast of long-term performance.
* **Last Market Close ($42.12):**  The close is not significantly different to trigger a classification of "sharp upturn" or "sharp downturn".


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows mixed results. While revenue has generally been increasing, EPS fluctuates significantly, indicating some volatility in profitability.  The October 24th, 2024 EPS of $0.80 is notably higher than previous quarters, and requires comparing it against analyst expectations to fully assess its significance.  Further analysis is needed concerning the 2024-10-24 entry being duplicated in the provided data.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**


**(1) Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a slight upward trend in the first half of 2024 followed by a dip in Q3. Profit margins have varied, peaking in Q2 2024 and falling in the subsequent quarters.  This suggests some sensitivity to market conditions and potentially fluctuating gold prices.

**(2) Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows a slight downward trend, with ROE being highly volatile and demonstrating both positive and negative results.  The significantly negative ROE in Q4 2023 raises concerns regarding profitability during that period.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires current news sources to provide accurate and up-to-date information.  Please provide recent news articles from sources like Shacknews or FINBOLD.)*  An analysis of recent earnings news, analyst opinions, and market outlook is needed here.

**7. Overall Summary:**

NEM shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the historical period examined. While recent earnings ($0.80 EPS in Q3 2024) were strong, historical volatility in EPS and ROE raise concerns. Technical indicators point to a potential short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook is uncertain given the underperformance against the market and the prediction of no excess return. More detailed analysis and up-to-date news (including analyst opinions and market outlook) are needed for a definitive conclusion. The lack of positive growth against the S&P500, despite relatively strong recent quarterly revenue, is troubling. The negative ROE in Q4 2023 further emphasizes the need for thorough investigation of the company's performance. The relatively low RSI suggests it could be oversold and may bounce back, but it is risky to rely on a short-term bounce.
