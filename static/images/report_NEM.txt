|------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|

**Analysis:**

*   The negative alpha values indicate underperformance relative to the market on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   The high beta values closer to recent years suggest NEM's price is more volatile than the market, potentially amplifying both gains and losses.
*   The negative alpha throughout different periods suggests systematic underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   Maximum Drawdown(MDD) is considerably high, so it is important to consider risk management.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **Current Price:** 86.86
*   **Previous Close:** 86.43
*   **Change:** 0.5 (Slight increase)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 85.439
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 81.7025
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 71.7804

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, which is generally a bullish signal.
*   The increasing trend of the moving averages themselves (60-day < 20-day < 5-day) further supports this bullish momentum.
*   The positive change from the previous close (0.5) reinforces the short-term upward trend, although it's not a dramatic jump.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 74.57 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** -0.0391 (Slightly below zero, indicating potential for upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (8 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_0.25 (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-04)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Disparity Change:** 1.3 (+) - Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return (%):** -63.5 (Negative long-term excess return vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI suggests the market environment is conducive to investment, but this is a general market indicator and doesn't guarantee Newmont's success.
*   The RSI near 70 suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term, indicating a possible pullback.
*   The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a potential shift to positive momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a strong buying opportunity with the current parameters.
*   The negative expected return is a major red flag. It indicates that, based on the model, investing in Newmont now is likely to result in *underperforming* the S&P 500 over the long term.
*   The price change of 0.5 is not particularly large, so it doesn't suggest any major market-moving event.

*   **Earnings Preview:** Barchart anticipates Newmont's upcoming report.

**7. Overall Summary:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) presents a mixed picture. Recent earnings and financial data show strong improvements in revenue, profit margins, and ROE. Technical indicators suggest short-term bullish momentum. However, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the long-term expected return is negative. Analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy," but the limited upside potential and wide range of target prices reflect uncertainty. The CEO succession and sector-wide scrutiny add further complexity.

**Recommendation:**

Given the negative long-term expected return, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and the high volatility (high MDD), a cautious approach to Newmont is warranted. Investors should carefully weigh the recent positive financial data against the significant risks before making any investment decisions. A price pullback due to the overbought RSI could present a better entry point if the negative expected return is addressed.
