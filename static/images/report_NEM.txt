The current price of NEM is $45.49, down from the previous close of $46.46 (-2.09%). This represents a relatively minor daily price decline.  The price is above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **PPO (0.87):** Positive value suggests upward momentum.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's recent performance has been mixed. While the company shows improvement in revenue, profitability, and equity in recent quarters, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  Technical indicators suggest near-term overbought conditions.  The extremely negative expected return needs to be verified.  The positive alpha in the last two years, combined with the recent improvement in financial metrics, is a counterpoint to the longer term underperformance relative to the broader market. Further investigation into the -150.9% expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment strategy may be viable if the negative expected return is corrected, however, the risk should be considered in light of its recent high beta values and its history of high maximum drawdown.  Investors should carefully consider this risk profile and the uncertainties surrounding the provided expected return.
