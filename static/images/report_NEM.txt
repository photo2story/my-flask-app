## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold producer with significant mining operations worldwide.  The cumulative return of NEM (30.65%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (120.40%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -89.7%, placing it at the 4th percentile of historical divergence relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta varies significantly year to year), with periods of significant outperformance and underperformance. Alpha consistently registers near zero, suggesting that the stock's returns are largely explained by market movements.  The significant swings in CAGR, MDD (Maximum Drawdown), and Beta highlight the volatility associated with this gold mining stock. Note: the extremely high negative CAGR in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 should be investigated further.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $41.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $41.74
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $48.35

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average underscores this downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.45):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (0.64):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **Relative Strength:** Recent 20-day relative strength is slightly positive (0.1), hinting at a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided data indicates no expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This should be viewed with caution; a 0% expected return may not necessarily reflect the stock's potential, but rather the limitations of the data provided. If the $41.5 price is a significant point, it could be interpreted as a potential support level. A break below this level may indicate further downside pressure.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some volatility in both EPS and Revenue.  While revenue generally shows an upward trend, particularly in the past two quarters, EPS has been quite volatile and dropped significantly in the first quarter of 2024.  There is no information provided to compare results against expectations, therefore beats and misses cannot be identified. More data is needed for a complete analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue has shown growth in recent quarters, particularly a significant jump in Q3 2024.
* **Profit Margin:**  Profit margins have been volatile but generally trended upward until a slight dip in the latest quarter (Q3 2024).  The significant drop in Q4 2023 should be further investigated.
* **Equity:** Equity shows a general upward trend but with significant volatility.
* **ROE:** The Return on Equity has been erratic, including a negative value in Q4 2023. This fluctuation signals instability in profitability and should be investigated.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook information or analyst opinions were provided for analysis. This significantly hampers a complete assessment of the stock.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. While recent revenue growth and some positive technical indicators (oversold RSI) suggest a potential short-term bounce, the inconsistent performance, low ROE, volatile EPS, significant market underperformance, and lack of positive news warrant caution. The lack of comparative data against earnings expectations and the absence of recent news and analyst opinions severely limits the thoroughness of this analysis. Further investigation into the reasons for the extreme negative CAGR figures in the last two years is critical. The 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests that significant risk is present without any significant anticipated return advantage.  Investing in NEM requires a high tolerance for risk and a deep understanding of the gold market and the company's specific challenges.  More comprehensive data is needed to provide a more confident assessment.
