**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. While recent earnings show revenue growth, the negative expected return, the low RSI and negative PPO, along with the price being below its moving averages, suggest a bearish outlook in the short term. The highly negative long-term expected return (-194.3%) needs further scrutiny to determine the validity of this prediction.  Before making any investment decisions, additional research is needed to assess the underlying reasons for the underperformance and the accuracy of the long-term return projection, considering factors such as gold price predictions and company-specific news.  The significant price drop needs further investigation to determine if it is a temporary correction or signals a more substantial trend.
