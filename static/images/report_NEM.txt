**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $40.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $41.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $47.77

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (29.85):** Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (0.53):** A positive value suggests some bullish momentum, although weak.
* **Recent Relative Divergence (-0.7):** Shows a short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  This indicates that, based on the provided data, there's no expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) accumulation investments.  This does not account for potential future market shifts or the inherent risks in gold mining.  The low expected return needs further analysis and may warrant consideration of risk tolerance. The current price of $40.22, being below the moving averages, doesn't suggest a sudden rebound or crash based solely on this data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture:

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has generally increased over the past four quarters, experiencing a significant jump from Q3 2023 to Q4 2023.  However, recent quarters show some signs of slowing revenue growth.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS fluctuates significantly, dropping sharply in Q1 2024 before recovering to a higher level in Q2 and Q3 2024.
* **Quarterly Comparison:**  There's no consistent trend; EPS and revenue figures show variation from quarter to quarter, requiring further investigation to determine potential contributing factors.  No specific expectations are provided against which to measure beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable with growth showing in the most recent two quarters. Profit margins show a recent high, with a dip in Q1 2024, possibly indicating seasonality or other factors.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been fairly consistent recently, but ROE shows great variability, experiencing significant negative values in Q4 2023.  This requires further investigation into the underlying causes.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or analyst opinions are provided within the given data.  To assess the current market outlook and analyst sentiment, further research is necessary.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Newmont's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While recent quarters show improved EPS and revenue figures, the overall trend is volatile and needs further evaluation. The stock is currently trading below its moving averages, and technical indicators suggest an oversold condition but with a weak positive momentum signal. The lack of expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term investment based on the data should be given significant consideration.  Additional information (news, analyst ratings, and industry-specific data) is required for a more comprehensive and informed investment decision.
