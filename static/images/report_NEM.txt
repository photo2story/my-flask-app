**4. Recent Financial Performance & Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show fluctuating performance, with a notable increase in revenue and EPS in the most recent quarters.  The most recent earnings report shows $0.8 EPS and $4.61B revenue.  However, a thorough analysis requires comparing these figures to analyst expectations and previous periods.  The provided data doesn't include those comparisons, limiting the interpretation's depth.


**5. Quarterly Financial Data Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue has been relatively stable, but profit margins show a downward trend from Q2 2024 to Q4 2023. This needs further investigation to understand the contributing factors (e.g., commodity prices, operating costs).

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has remained relatively stable, while Return on Equity (ROE) has been volatile, even showing a negative value. This requires deeper analysis to understand the drivers of ROE fluctuations and their implications for future performance.

**7. Overall Analysis (Summary of points 1-6):**

NEM is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing a significant negative divergence.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions but a bearish trend prevails.  Recent financial results show some strength in revenue and earnings, but profit margins and ROE fluctuate, indicating potential volatility.  The lack of comparative data against analyst expectations limits the depth of the financial analysis.   Current news and analyst sentiment are crucial for a more comprehensive evaluation and will be added once the data is provided.  The 0% expected return suggests that outperformance against the S&P 500 is not expected in the long term (based on the information provided).  Investment decisions should consider the high risk indicated by the large MDD values in the provided alpha/beta analysis.
