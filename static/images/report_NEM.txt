## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM), a leading gold producer and mining company, shows a cumulative return of 33.17% over the analyzed period.  This significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a 120.36% return. The difference in cumulative returns is -87.2%, placing it at the 6.5th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (relative divergence).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $42.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $38.95
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $41.82

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  However, it's relatively close to its 60-day moving average, indicating some potential for consolidation or correction.  The recent price change of $1.63 reflects a significant daily increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 80.43 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO:** 1.68 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.0 – This confirms short-term upward movement.

The recent significant price increase (1.63) should be considered in light of the high RSI value. It may indicate a temporary surge rather than sustained growth, highlighting the risk of a potential correction. The expected return of -249.9% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is extremely negative and requires further investigation into the underlying assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue          |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.80 | $4.61 Billion    |
| 2024-07-25 | $0.74 | $4.40 Billion    |
| 2024-04-29 | $0.15 | $4.02 Billion    |
| 2023-10-26 | $0.20 | $2.49 Billion    |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.20 | $2.49 Billion    | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings have been volatile.  There's a significant increase in EPS and Revenue from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024, followed by a decrease (or potential error in data entry for Oct 24th).  A thorough review of the data source is recommended to clarify the discrepancy in the October 24th entries.  The substantial fluctuations warrant further analysis to understand the underlying drivers.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.61B   | 36.13%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.40B   | 37.35%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.02B   | 31.39%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.96B   | 24.59%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.49B   | 25.75%        |


Revenue shows a generally upward trend, although profit margins fluctuated. The improvement in profit margins from Q4 2023 to Q2 2024 is notable but requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE      |
|---------|------------|----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $29.71B   | 3.10%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $29.38B   | 2.90%    |
| 2024-03-31 | $28.89B   | 0.59%    |
| 2023-12-31 | $29.03B   | -10.88%   |
| 2023-09-30 | $19.07B   | 0.83%    |

Equity shows a general increase, but ROE is highly volatile, experiencing a significant negative value in Q4 2023.  This volatility needs to be examined in conjunction with the revenue and profit margin data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings and revenue show growth, the high RSI, volatile ROE, and large negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raise significant concerns. The data suggests short-term upward momentum, but the overbought conditions and significant historical underperformance compared to the market warrant caution.  Further investigation is needed to address the data inconsistencies and assess the sustainability of the recent positive trends.  The extremely negative projected return against the S&P 500 requires careful scrutiny of the underlying assumptions and model used to generate this prediction.  The current price action might represent a short-term bounce, but a long-term investment should be carefully evaluated.
