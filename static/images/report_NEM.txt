* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $46.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $51.25

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (15.51):**  Indicates the stock is significantly oversold, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible. However, this alone is not sufficient to predict a rebound.

* **PPO (-1.33):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-25.7%):**  Shows a significant recent decline in relative performance against the market.

* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% suggests that, based on the available information, no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated over the long term (2+ years). This aligns with the historical underperformance observed.  If the $40.92 closing price represents a sharp drop, it could indicate an overreaction in the short term, but it does not alter the long-term outlook given the other information.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show a mixed picture. While revenue has generally increased, EPS shows volatility. The most recent EPS of $0.80, accompanied by strong revenue of $4.61B, shows positive growth compared to previous quarters but needs comparison to analyst expectations. Without further context such as analyst forecasts, it's difficult to fully assess the significance of these results.  A comparison to prior years' results and industry averages would provide a more thorough evaluation.

**5. Financial Information:**

The provided quarterly data (Revenue and Profitability, Capital and Profitability) reveals significant fluctuations in Profit Margins and ROE. While revenue consistently remained above $4B for the past few quarters, profitability and return on equity have been volatile, indicating a certain degree of risk and uncertainty surrounding the company's performance. The recent drop in ROE is particularly concerning.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period shown.  While the recent earnings report shows some positive signs, volatility in profitability and ROE highlight significant risk. The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and substantial underperformance relative to the market raise concerns.  Further analysis of recent news and comparison with analyst expectations is necessary before drawing definitive conclusions.  The long-term outlook, according to the provided expected return, does not suggest significant outperformance versus the S&P 500.  The high MDD values across several periods further reinforces the inherent risk.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data and the significant underperformance against the benchmark, a thorough review of the latest market analysis and analyst forecasts is recommended before making any investment decisions. The high risk profile highlighted by the MDD figures and volatile profitability warrants caution.  Potential investors should carefully evaluate the gold market outlook and consider the company's risk tolerance before investing.  Diversification is crucial to mitigate risk.
