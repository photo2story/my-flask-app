## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading global gold producer.  Recent performance shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), though recent earnings show increasing revenue and profit margins.  Technical indicators suggest potential overbought conditions.  Long-term prospects require further investigation.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) has accumulated a return of 45.77% while the S&P 500 (VOO) has accumulated a return of 120.05% over the unspecified period. This represents a significant underperformance of -74.3%, placing it at the 12.7th percentile of the historical range (-100.7% to 107.2%) relative to the S&P 500's performance.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods.  While some years show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), recent years (2021-2025) indicate significantly negative returns with increasing beta (higher market sensitivity).  This highlights the volatility and market sensitivity of NEM, particularly in recent times.  The large negative CAGR values in the recent periods point towards significant underperformance compared to the previous years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $46.46
* **5-day Moving Average:** $44.90
* **20-day Moving Average:** $42.50
* **60-day Moving Average:** $40.98

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, the relatively small difference between the price and the 5-day moving average might indicate potential consolidation or a minor correction.  The significant gap between the closing price and the longer-term moving averages signifies a recent price rally.  The jump from previous close indicates a sharp increase in price (3.61%).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 76.31  – Indicates overbought conditions; the stock may be susceptible to a short-term correction.
* **PPO:** 1.00 – Suggests positive momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 3.8 (+), indicating a recent short-term uptrend.
* **Expected Return:** -129.2% – This extremely negative figure represents a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) horizon, assuming current trends continue.  This prediction strongly warrants further investigation and a reassessment of the underlying assumptions.
