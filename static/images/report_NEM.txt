**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation is a leading gold mining company.  The cumulative return of NEM (47.80%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 76.18%, resulting in a -28.4% difference.  The relative lag of 29.6% places NEM's performance in the lower third of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results across different periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), particularly between 2019-2021, others show substantial negative alpha, especially in the recent years, suggesting vulnerability to market downturns (high Beta).  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values consistently highlight the significant risk associated with this stock.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly, particularly in the most recent period.  While some periods show positive alpha, the high beta and substantial maximum drawdowns highlight significant risk.  Recent price action shows some short-term support, but the long-term outlook appears bearish, based on the negative expected return compared to the S&P 500.  Financial statements reveal some volatility in profitability and ROE, which needs further investigation.  Before any investment decision, it is recommended to conduct a thorough analysis considering the inherent risks and volatility in the gold mining sector.  The conflicting signals from technical indicators and the negative long-term expected return suggest caution.  Investors should carefully weigh the risks before investing in NEM.
