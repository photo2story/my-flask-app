**1. Performance Comparison:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of 20.43% compared to VOO's 56.36%.  The -35.9% difference highlights a substantial underperformance.  The relative divergence of 25.1% suggests that while underperforming, this level of underperformance isn't entirely unprecedented based on historical data.

The provided CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) data shows fluctuating performance over various timeframes, with periods of strong returns followed by periods of significant losses.  Alpha values generally indicate underperformance relative to the market (negative or near zero) except for more recent periods showing higher alpha values, possibly influenced by specific market conditions. Beta values consistently show moderate market sensitivity.  Market capitalization has shown growth over the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $45.555
* **Last Market Change:** +1.52% (a small positive change)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $47.017
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $46.9488
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $44.4731

The stock price is currently below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.  The recent 1.52% increase could be interpreted as a small bounce, but it's too early to conclude a significant trend reversal.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883, indicating a high-risk level.
* **RSI:** 38.86, below 50, suggesting bearish momentum.

* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +5.4%, signifying a recent short-term upward trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's recent performance has been weak relative to the S&P 500. Technical indicators point towards bearish sentiment.  While recent earnings show improved revenue, the high Market Risk Indicator (MRI) and negative expected return warrant caution.  The substantial negative expected return (-47.5%) should be carefully scrutinized given it's such a pessimistic outlook.  Before making any investment decision, a much more in-depth analysis of the underlying factors driving the expected return and other market factors is essential.  The information provided is insufficient for conclusive investment recommendations.  Further research including a competitive analysis, industry outlook, and thorough macroeconomic analysis is strongly recommended.
