**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Newmont Corporation is a leading gold and copper mining company.  The cumulative return of NEM (11.31%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (85.44%) over the considered period, resulting in a large negative difference of -74.1%.  The relative divergence of 17.2% indicates that this underperformance is relatively low compared to the historical range of divergence between the two assets.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta data show inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO). While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance),  others (especially recently) show significantly negative alpha, indicating considerable underperformance against the market benchmark. The Beta is also volatile, ranging widely and increasing in the last few periods, suggesting increasing market sensitivity. High negative alpha and increased market sensitivity could suggest that the company is undergoing a significant period of underperformance. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) generally shows an upward trend, though this should be examined in conjunction with other financial metrics.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  Revenue shows a general upward trend, but EPS is erratic. The October 2024 EPS figure appears duplicated in the provided data.  Further investigation into the discrepancy is needed.  A deeper dive into the financial statements is required to fully understand the drivers of the earnings fluctuations.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.8  | $4.61 B        |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.74 | $4.40 B        |
| 2024-04-29 | 0.15 | $4.02 B        |
| 2023-10-26 | 0.2  | $2.49 B        |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.2  | $2.49 B        | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals strong revenue growth but mixed profitability. Profit margins show fluctuation but are generally high. Return on Equity (ROE) is highly volatile, showing periods of both positive and negative returns.  The significant drop in ROE in 2023-12-31 requires further analysis to understand the underlying causes.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $5.65B | 45.51% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered. While recent price action shows some signs of recovery, the predicted long-term underperformance (-143.2%) is a serious concern.  The volatile earnings and ROE figures, along with high negative alpha in recent periods, raise questions about the company's future prospects.  Further investigation is needed into the causes of the negative ROE, the duplicated earnings data entry, and the underlying drivers of the inconsistent performance. Before considering any investment, a more thorough due diligence process, including an examination of the company's future growth prospects and strategic plans, is highly recommended.  The currently predicted long-term underperformance, coupled with significant volatility, suggests that NEM may not be a suitable investment for risk-averse investors.
