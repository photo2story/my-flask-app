Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold and copper mining company.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  While NEM had a cumulative return of 26.21%, VOO achieved a return of 121.78%.  This results in a substantial lag of -95.6%, placing it at the 1.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests NEM significantly underperformed the market benchmark over the analyzed period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $40.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $41.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $47.54

The current price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average suggests a more substantial decline in recent months.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (33.44):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce. However, it's important to note that oversold conditions can persist.
* **PPO (0.37):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, but the relatively low value indicates this momentum might be weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-2.9):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The expected return is 0%, implying no significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is anticipated in the long term (2+ years) based on the provided data. This is consistent with its historical underperformance.
* **Price Considerations:** The current price ($40.08) being below the moving averages doesn't necessarily signify a sudden, dramatic drop or rebound. It simply reflects a continuing downtrend.  Further analysis is needed to determine the likelihood of a significant price change.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue figures.

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue shows some growth from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024 ($2.49B to $4.61B).  However, there's no consistent upward trend apparent.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS has exhibited significant volatility. While Q3 2024 saw a significant increase compared to previous quarters, it is not a consistent pattern.  There are notable ups and downs.
* **Significant Changes:** The most dramatic change is seen in the jump from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024 EPS.
* **Beats/Misses:** The data does not include any expected values for comparison, therefore we cannot assess whether the reported numbers beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions are provided.  This information is crucial for a comprehensive investment analysis and is missing from the provided data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's recent performance has been significantly below that of the S&P 500.  While the stock is currently in oversold territory (RSI), the lack of consistent revenue and earnings growth, coupled with fluctuating profit margins and ROE, raises concerns. The absence of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more complete assessment.

More information is required, particularly regarding recent news and market sentiment, before a robust investment decision can be made.  The data suggests a potentially risky investment.

Given the current information, a more in-depth analysis is crucial before any investment decision is made.  Conduct thorough research into recent news, analyst ratings, and future growth prospects.  Consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate the risk associated with NEM's inconsistent performance and volatility.  The data suggests further investigation is needed before considering NEM as a long-term investment option.
