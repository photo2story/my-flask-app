## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:** Newmont Corporation (NEM), a leading gold mining company, has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While showing periods of strong growth, recent performance has been negative,  with indicators suggesting potential risk.  Further analysis is needed to determine future prospects.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading global gold producer, operating mines across several continents.

* **Cumulative Return:** NEM: 49.51%, VOO: 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** NEM underperformed VOO by 33.1 percentage points.  The relative underperformance places it at the 26.8th percentile of its historical range (max 89.4%, min -78%).

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows fluctuating performance relative to the market (beta) and inconsistent alpha (excess return).  While some periods (2019-2021) show strong positive alpha, other periods (2022-2025) show significantly negative alpha, indicating sensitivity to market conditions and potentially poor risk-adjusted returns. Market capitalization also fluctuates, but generally remains within the $40B - $60B range.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $55.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $54.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $50.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.92

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The recent significant price increase ('change': 4.8%) indicates a potential short-term upward trend, warranting further investigation into the cause of this jump.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 66.52 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.5183 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.2% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** -36.9% (Long-term (2+ years) expected underperformance compared to S&P 500)

The relatively high RSI and positive PPO suggest bullish momentum, but the negative relative divergence and high MRI suggest caution.  The significant price increase needs further examination to determine if it reflects sustainable growth or temporary market fluctuation. The negative long-term expected return warrants careful consideration.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

| 2025-04-24 | $1.68  | $5.01B        |

There's a significant increase in EPS and revenue in Q1 2025,  but this data needs verification for accuracy since the duplicate entry of 2025-04-24 suggests potential data entry error.  Further analysis of the underlying drivers of revenue and earnings is needed to assess sustainability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, with a negative alpha in recent years.  While recent financial data shows strong revenue growth and improved profit margins,  the inconsistency in ROE and the negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 raise concerns.  The recent price surge requires further investigation to understand the underlying drivers. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with bullish momentum countered by a relatively high risk indicator and short-term bearish divergence.  A thorough analysis of the causes behind the recent price jump and a deeper dive into the sustainability of recent earnings growth are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The potential data errors in the provided earnings data also need to be addressed.
