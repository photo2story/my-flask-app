## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Investment Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold and copper mining company.  The cumulative return of NEM is 30.78%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 119.94%. The provided data shows a considerable lag of -89.2%, placing it in the 5.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates NEM's underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility in NEM's performance relative to the market. While some periods show strong outperformance (e.g., 2019-2021), others reveal substantial underperformance (e.g., 2021-2025).  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests the stock's returns haven't significantly deviated from what would be expected given its beta, indicating market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $41.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $40.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $41.05

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent minor pullback after a period of higher prices.  The price is above the 20-day moving average indicating a potential short-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 77.62 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.67 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +0.6 (Positive, indicating short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -313.7% (This indicates a significant projected underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, a concerning figure requiring further investigation).  The extremely negative expected return needs further clarification on how this figure was calculated, as it seems unrealistic.

The slight price increase (+$0.58)  doesn't indicate a significant  sudden jump or drop.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.80 | $4.61 Billion |
| 2024-07-25 | $0.74 | $4.40 Billion |
| 2024-04-29 | $0.15 | $4.02 Billion |
| 2023-10-26 | $0.20 | $2.49 Billion |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.20 | $2.49 Billion | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings show substantial growth in revenue and EPS in the recent quarters (Q2 & Q3 2024),  but also volatility. The apparent duplication in the October 2024 entry needs clarification.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers behind this fluctuation.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.61B  | 36.13%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.40B  | 37.35%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.02B  | 31.39%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.96B  | 24.59%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.49B  | 25.75%       |


Revenue has shown a clear upward trend in recent quarters, with corresponding fluctuations in profit margins.  Further investigation into the factors driving these margin changes is necessary.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE     |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $29.71B  | 3.10%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $29.38B  | 2.90%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $28.89B  | 0.59%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $29.03B  | -10.88%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $19.07B  | 0.83%   |


Equity shows growth, but ROE (Return on Equity) is highly volatile, indicating potential challenges in profitability. The negative ROE in Q4 2023 is particularly noteworthy and requires further investigation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance has been inconsistent, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 over the period reviewed. While recent earnings show revenue growth, profit margins and ROE exhibit volatility.  Technical indicators suggest an overbought condition and potential for a near-term correction.  The extremely negative long-term expected return, if accurate, raises significant concerns about investment in this stock.  Further research is crucial before making any investment decisions, particularly to understand the extremely low projected returns and resolve the inconsistencies and data errors present in the provided data.  Thorough due diligence is required to validate the accuracy and reliability of the data and to assess the risk profile appropriately.
