This represents a significant underperformance of -89.3% relative to the S&P 500.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $38.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $43.12

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day moving average highlights a considerable price drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.26 –  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but approaching overbought territory.
* **PPO:** 0.91 – A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.5 – Indicates a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -288.1% – This extremely negative expected return, relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon (2+ years), is a significant warning sign.  It suggests a substantial risk of further underperformance.  The current price ($39.17) is not explicitly stated as "high" requiring a significant upward revision.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.80   | $4.61B       |
| 2024-07-25 | $0.74   | $4.40B       |
| 2024-04-29 | $0.15   | $4.02B       |
| 2023-10-26 | $0.20   | $2.49B       |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.20   | $2.49B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


Earnings show volatility, with significant increases in EPS and Revenue in Q2 and Q3 2024 compared to previous quarters.  The duplicated entry needs clarification. Further investigation into the data source is required to ensure accuracy.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.61B | 36.13%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.40B | 37.35%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.02B | 31.39%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.96B | 24.59%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.49B | 25.75%       |

Revenue shows a generally upward trend, with strong profitability margins.  However, the considerable drop in ROE in 2023-12-31 requires further analysis to understand the underlying cause.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE     |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $29.71B | 3.10%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $29.38B | 2.90%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $28.89B | 0.59%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $29.03B | -10.88%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $19.07B | 0.83%   |

Equity shows overall growth, but ROE highlights significant profitability concerns, particularly the negative ROE in Q4 2023.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's recent performance has been significantly underwhelming compared to the S&P 500. While recent earnings show positive growth, the substantial negative expected return relative to the market and the volatile ROE raise significant concerns.  The negative trend indicated by the moving averages further supports the bearish outlook. The substantial drop in the stock price relative to its 60-day moving average suggests a potential downward correction.  Before investing, a thorough investigation into the reasons for the negative ROE in Q4 2023 and the data errors in the earnings data is crucial.  The highly negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 strongly advises against a long-term investment in NEM at this time unless significant changes in the company's prospects occur.
