**Analysis:**

**1) Return and Alpha/Beta:**

*   Newmont has underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.
*   The divergence of -4.7 suggests Newmont's cumulative return lags behind the S&P 500 by that amount. The relative divergence of 57.1 indicates where the current divergence sits within its historical range.
*   The Alpha values are consistently negative for most periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market.  However, the last period (2023-2025) shows a positive Alpha.
*   Beta values have generally increased, suggesting that NEM's price is becoming more sensitive to market movements, especially in recent years.
* The maximum drawdown (MDD) is very high, indicating there were times when NEM stock dropped substantially.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   The current price is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. The 5-day SMA is highest, but it may still be consolidating before it can take off.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.9 suggests a "High Investment Recommended" based on the model, which should be viewed cautiously given other indicators.
*   The RSI of 64.47 is approaching overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the recent price increase may be unsustainable.
*   The PPO being slightly positive suggests short-term upward momentum, but it's a very weak signal.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a full buy of 11 shares with additional monthly investment.
*   The recent increase in relative divergence is also indicative of a short-term price rise.
*   The **Expected Return of -35.4% is a major red flag.** This suggests that, according to the model, the stock is significantly overvalued, or that fundamental factors are expected to negatively impact future performance.

**4) Recent News and Events:**

*   The news headlines paint a mixed picture. Recent negative news about a stock crash and margin hikes is concerning. While some sources claim the stock is a "buy," the negative news cannot be ignored.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   The "Buy" consensus is encouraging, but consider the target price range. The low end of the target price ($62) is significantly below the current price, while the average is slightly above the current price.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

*   The EPS and revenue figures show increasing trend.

**6) Financial Information: Revenue, Profitability, Capital, and ROE:**

*   Revenue generally increased over the periods.
*   Profit margins have also increased, which is a positive trend.
*   Equity has been consistently growing, indicating financial health.
*   ROE has fluctuated but is generally stable, suggesting consistent profitability relative to equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Based on the provided data, here's a comprehensive analysis:

*   **Mixed Signals:** There are conflicting signals regarding Newmont's investment potential. The MRI and analyst consensus lean positive, but the negative expected return, negative Alpha, and concerning news headlines raise serious concerns.
*   **Underperformance:** Newmont has underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Short-Term Upward Trend:** Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term upward trend, but the RSI approaching overbought territory warrants caution.
*   **Negative Long-Term Outlook:** The -35.4% expected return suggests a negative outlook for the next two years, potentially based on factors not immediately apparent in the other data points. This could be due to anticipated declines in gold prices, rising costs, or other factors.
*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Recent increase in revenues and profits.

**Conclusion:**

While Newmont shows some positive trends in revenue, profitability, and recent price movement, the significantly negative expected return and underperformance compared to the S&P 500 are major warning signs. The mixed news headlines and analyst opinions add to the uncertainty. **Given these conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted.** Further investigation is needed to understand the factors driving the negative expected return and to assess the long-term viability of the investment. Consider the risks and do further research.
