## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Investment Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold and copper mining company.  The provided data shows NEM's cumulative return of 19.16% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 118.39%.  The difference is -99.2%, placing it at the 0.7th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data also reflects periods of both strong and weak performance relative to the market. The recent -64% and -74% CAGR figures highlight significant underperformance in the most recent periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $37.84
* **5-day Moving Average:** $38.14
* **20-day Moving Average:** $40.03
* **60-day Moving Average:** $45.39

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 31.65 (Suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a bounce, but not confirmation of a trend reversal)
* **PPO:** -0.12 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.6 (Short-term upward movement, but within a larger downtrend context).
* **Expected Return:** -1580.3% (This extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation.  It's likely this figure contains an error or needs significant context clarification. The negative sign could simply indicate underperformance relative to VOO over a longer time frame, but the magnitude is implausible).  The 37.84 price does not suggest a major sudden price move (either up or down) based solely on this data.  More data is required for better context.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Generally increasing, but with a notable drop between Q3 2023 and Q4 2023, followed by a rebound.
* **EPS:**  Significant fluctuation, with a peak in Q4 2024, followed by a drop in subsequent quarters. This needs further analysis beyond what's presented here to understand the underlying drivers.  There is a duplication of the Oct 24th, 2024 data point, which needs clarification.  No benchmarks (e.g., analyst expectations) are provided for comparison.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue has shown growth but with significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.
* **Profit Margin:**  While profit margins are generally healthy, there's considerable variability, suggesting sensitivity to market conditions.
* **Equity:** Equity shows some fluctuation, but generally increasing except for a drop at the end of 2023.
* **ROE:**  ROE is highly volatile, ranging from significantly negative to positive, indicating cyclical profitability dependent on market factors. The very large drop in ROE at the end of 2023 and significant recovery deserves further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or analyst opinions are provided in the prompt.  To complete this section, current news sources would need to be consulted.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the periods shown. While some technical indicators (RSI) suggest oversold conditions, the overall trend appears bearish, supported by the negative PPO and the price being below its moving averages. Recent earnings data reveals volatility in both revenue and EPS. The provided "Expected Return" of -1580.3% is highly suspect and should be disregarded unless it is clarified.  Financial statement data indicates cyclical performance.  Additional context (market conditions, industry trends, company-specific news) is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  The provided data alone is insufficient to make an informed investment recommendation.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the significant underperformance against the market, volatile financial performance, and lack of context from news or analyst opinions, further research is strongly advised before making any investment decision in NEM.  Specifically, investigating the reasons for the large swings in ROE and the seemingly erroneous expected return figure should be prioritized.
