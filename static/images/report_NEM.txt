**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of key financial data like total revenue and gross profit significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This data is crucial for assessing profitability and financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period. While positive momentum is suggested by some indicators (PPO, price action relative to moving averages), other indicators (RSI, expected return, relative divergence) point to potential near-term weakness and significant long-term underperformance against the market. The lack of crucial financial data hampers a complete assessment. The inconsistent Alpha and Beta values suggest sensitivity to market conditions.  Before making any investment decision, thorough due diligence, including access to full financial statements, is strongly recommended.  The -36.9% expected return should be treated with significant caution, as it's a long-term prediction based on potentially incomplete data and may not reflect future performance.
