**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally increased quarter-over-quarter, with a notable spike in Q3 2024 ($4.61B).  However, there is some fluctuation.
* **EPS:** EPS has shown substantial variability, peaking at $0.8 in Q3 2024 before declining significantly. There appears to be a duplicate entry for October 24th, 2024 which needs clarification.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have fluctuated, reaching a high of 37.35% in Q2 2024 and then declining in subsequent quarters.  The significant drop in the profit margin in Q4 2023 (-10.88% ROE) is particularly noteworthy and requires further investigation.

Without access to expected earnings, it's impossible to definitively say whether results beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data shows:

* **Revenue Growth:**  Strong revenue growth is evident in recent quarters, particularly from Q3 2023 to Q3 2024, indicating a positive trend.
* **Profitability:** Profit margins show some volatility, suggesting potential market sensitivities in pricing of gold and copper.  The significant negative ROE in Q4 2023 is a major concern and warrants further analysis.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity has seen some increase but the ROE is volatile and concerning due to the negative value in Q4 2023.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires external news sources to provide context on recent earnings announcements (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  The provided data alone is insufficient.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent times. While recent revenue figures show positive growth, EPS and profitability are volatile, with several quarters exhibiting significantly poor results, most notably the negative ROE in Q4 2023.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal, suggesting caution. The 0.0% expected return reinforces concerns regarding its long-term underperformance. A thorough examination of the Q4 2023 results and current market conditions is vital before making any investment decisions.  Missing information about earnings expectations prevents a complete analysis of whether earnings "beat" or "missed".  Additional research into industry trends, geopolitical factors (affecting gold and copper prices), and management commentary are crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
