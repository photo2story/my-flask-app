NEM shows a mixed performance picture.

The high volatility and fluctuating alpha and beta values suggest significant risk.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent price increase, the negative long-term expected return, and the duplicated data points is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough due diligence including an examination of the gold market outlook and NEM's competitive landscape is strongly recommended.
