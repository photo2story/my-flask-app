**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some volatility. Revenue has generally increased over the past year but the EPS is quite volatile.  The October 2024 EPS of $0.8 is significantly higher than previous quarters but we lack information on whether this beat or missed analyst expectations.  A comparison to analyst estimates for the October 2024 quarter is needed for a complete assessment.


**5. Quarterly Financial Data Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been relatively stable, with a minor dip in Q3 2023, before bouncing back. Profit margins have fluctuated, showing strength in Q2 2024 but then a significant decline in Q4 2023.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE has been highly volatile, ranging from significant losses (-10.88% in Q4 2023) to positive but relatively low values. This volatility highlights the cyclical nature of the mining industry.

*(This section requires information from recent news sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD, as well as analyst reports, to provide a comprehensive analysis of recent news, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.  Please provide these data sources for a complete analysis.)*


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM shows substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the given period.  While the recent price decline may suggest oversold conditions (RSI below 40), the negative divergence and the price's position below its moving averages point to a bearish trend. The volatility in both earnings and ROE indicate a high-risk investment.  The 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, based on the currently available data, suggests the potential for this underperformance to continue.  Additional information on recent news, analyst sentiment, and the October 2024 earnings expectations is crucial for a more accurate assessment.
