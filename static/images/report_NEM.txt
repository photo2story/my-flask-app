* **Closing Price:** $42.84
* **Last Market Price:** $42.71 (a decrease of $0.13)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $43.10
* **20-day Moving Average:** $45.04

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **PPO (-1.448):** Negative, confirming the bearish trend.
* **Relative Strength Divergence (-2.7):**  Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength.  The price change of -$0.13 indicates a slight daily decline, not a significant event (no rapid surge or plunge).
* **Expected Return (-207.9%):** This extremely negative figure suggests a significantly lower expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  This needs further clarification as a -207.9% return is not realistic.  It is likely an error in the data provided.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, showing negative CAGR and high MDD. While recent quarterly earnings show revenue growth and improving profit margins, the stock's price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend.  The extremely negative expected return needs clarification.  A long-term investment in NEM carries substantial risk given its recent performance.  More in-depth analysis of the underlying causes of the negative CAGR and high MDD, along with a re-evaluation of the expected return calculation, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Careful consideration should be given to the high volatility exhibited by the stock.
