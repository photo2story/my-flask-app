## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold and copper mining company.  The cumulative return of NEM is 32.19%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a 122.16% cumulative return.  The difference is -90.0%, placing it at the 5.1 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in NEM's performance across different periods, ranging from extremely high growth to substantial losses. The alpha consistently remains near zero, suggesting its returns are largely driven by market movements (beta), rather than outperformance.  The negative CAGR in recent years (-64% to -76%) indicates considerable underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $42.04
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $39.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $41.34

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but significantly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The small positive change from the previous close ($0.21) indicates minimal daily movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (79.45):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction is due.
* **PPO (1.28):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but the RSI indicates caution.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-2.3):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (-332.8%):** This extremely negative figure indicates a significantly lower expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This likely reflects the underperformance and risk associated with NEM.  The small recent price increase should be viewed in the context of this significantly negative outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals some inconsistencies. There are duplicate entries for October 24th, 2024.  Excluding the duplicate, the data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue growth.  While revenue generally increased, EPS shows significant volatility.  This needs further investigation for clarity and accuracy.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information shows strong revenue growth in recent quarters, but profit margins show some fluctuation.  The Return on Equity (ROE) is highly volatile, swinging from positive to significantly negative values, highlighting the risk inherent in the company.  Further analysis of the drivers behind this volatility is necessary.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, displaying high volatility in both price and earnings. While recent revenue growth is positive, profit margins and ROE are inconsistent. Technical indicators suggest the stock is overbought, increasing the risk of a correction.  The projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is extremely negative.  Investors should exercise caution and consider the high risk associated with NEM before investing.  Further due diligence, including analysis of commodity prices and the company's specific operational challenges, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
