*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows varied performance, with significant positive growth in some periods (e.g., 2019-2021) and substantial negative growth in others (e.g., 2022-2024). The recent negative CAGR suggests potential headwinds.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. NEM experiences considerable volatility, as evidenced by the relatively high MDD values.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the stock's performance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). Negative Alpha values suggest underperformance compared to the benchmark. The consistently negative and increasingly negative Alpha values in recent periods highlight a trend of underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta of 1 indicates that the stock's price tends to move with the market, while a Beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility than the market. NEM's Beta values have increased, particularly in the later periods, indicating that the stock has become more volatile relative to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in billions, showing the company size during each period.
*   **Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a concerning trend.  NEM has consistently underperformed its benchmark in recent years, and its volatility (Beta) has increased.  The large negative Alpha values in recent periods are a significant red flag.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3359 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 60.01 (Approaching overbought territory, but not yet there)

*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_69%_Sell 0.7% of holdings (6 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** -4.5 (Indicates recent short-term decline relative to the benchmark)
*   **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -156.9% (Long-term underperformance projection)
*   **Analysis:** While the MRI indicates low market risk, the high RSI suggests the stock might be slightly overbought in the short term. The PPO is near neutral, and the negative change in relative spread confirms recent underperformance.  The Hybrid Signal recommends a relatively conservative approach (high cash ratio). The significantly negative expected return is a major concern, suggesting a long-term negative outlook relative to the S&P 500.  The large price change today should be considered in light of the broader trend of underperformance.
