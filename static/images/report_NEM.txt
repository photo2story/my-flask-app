**1. Performance Comparison:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM) is a leading gold mining company.  Over the analyzed period, NEM significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 38.20% compared to VOO's 108.62%.  The difference of -70.4% highlights substantial underperformance.  The relative divergence suggests that while underperforming, NEM's current position is relatively better than the minimum divergence observed historically.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperforming the market), recent years (2021-2025) display increasingly higher beta and positive alpha, suggesting increased market sensitivity and potential outperformance during periods of market growth, but also potentially amplified losses during market downturns.  The high negative CAGR values in the last three periods indicate significant price decline.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 11.0% | 15.8% | -0.1 | 33.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 25.0% | 13.9% | 0.0 | 31.8 |
| 2017-2019  | 5.0% | 13.9% | -0.0 | 41.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 47.0% | 13.9% | 0.1 | 58.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 76.0% | 12.6% | 0.1 | 62.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -10.0% | 23.7% | 0.1 | 49.6 |
| 2021-2023  | -64.0% | 23.7% | 0.7 | 45.2 |
| 2022-2024  | -76.0% | 23.7% | 0.9 | 41.7 |
| 2023-2025  | -26.0% | 17.1% | 1.6 | 49.4 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of NEM is $43.87, slightly down from the previous close.  The 5-day moving average ($43.25) is below the current price, indicating recent price increases. However, both the 20-day ($44.70) and 60-day ($41.67) moving averages suggest a short-term downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (40.04):**  Approaching oversold territory, which could suggest a potential bounce, but it's not a guaranteed bullish signal.
* **PPO (-0.63):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** The recent 20-day relative divergence increase of 5.5% suggests a short-term upward trend.
* **Price Change:** The small negative price change (-$0.05) is not significant enough to warrant concerns about a sharp drop.  The change itself does not trigger a "급반등" (sharp rebound) or "급하락" (sharp decline) classification.
* **Expected Return:** The projected -123.2% long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is extremely negative and warrants serious caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue, with a notable dip in Q1 2024.  The most recent quarters show an increase in both EPS and revenue compared to the previous quarters.  Further analysis is needed to assess the underlying reasons for the fluctuations and to assess the overall financial health of the company and profitability.

| 날짜       | EPS | 매출        |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.8 | 4.61 B$      |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows a generally upward trend, although the profit margin fluctuates.  Equity is relatively stable, but ROE is erratic, showing periods of both profitability and significant losses.  The negative ROE in Q4 2023 is a significant concern.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $5.65B | 45.51% |
| 2024-09-30 | $4.61B | 36.13% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.40B | 37.35% |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.02B | 31.39% |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.96B | 24.59% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $29.93B | 4.69% |
| 2024-09-30 | $29.71B | 3.10% |
| 2024-06-30 | $29.38B | 2.90% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While some periods show positive alpha, the recent trend is overwhelmingly negative, with high beta suggesting increased market sensitivity.  Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) paint a bearish picture, although the RSI is approaching oversold levels.  Earnings show volatility, and the negative ROE in Q4 2023 is concerning. The extremely negative long-term expected return compared to VOO strongly suggests against a long-term investment in NEM at this time.  Further in-depth analysis and consideration of macroeconomic factors affecting the gold mining industry are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests significant risk associated with NEM.
