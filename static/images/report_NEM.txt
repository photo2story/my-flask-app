*   **Negatives:** Underperformance compared to the S&P 500, high maximum drawdown, negative Alpha in most periods, RSI suggesting overbought conditions, concerns about being overvalued (as reported by Forbes),  potential for job cuts and insider selling, high beta values.

Based on the data provided, a cautious approach is advised. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks against the potential rewards and consider their individual risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Monitoring the news and analyst opinions for any significant changes in the outlook is highly recommended.
