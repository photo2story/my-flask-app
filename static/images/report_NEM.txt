* **Expected Return:** -172.6% â€“  this dramatically negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 indicates that a long-term (2+ years) investment in NEM is projected to substantially underperform the broader market.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Newmont (NEM) presents a mixed picture. While recent earnings and financial data suggest a generally healthy financial position, its stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period and is projected to continue doing so over the long term.  The high RSI suggests the stock is overbought and prone to a potential correction.  The positive PPO and recent price increase signal short-term positive momentum, but the negative long-term expected return coupled with high volatility and generally low Alpha makes NEM a high-risk investment with potentially low rewards compared to the S&P 500.  Investors should proceed with caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in NEM.  Further investigation into the duplicated data entry and a more in-depth analysis of macroeconomic factors impacting the gold mining sector are recommended.
