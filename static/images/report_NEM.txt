Before making any investment decisions, additional research should be conducted to verify data accuracy (particularly the duplicate entry in earnings and the -28.8% expected return), understand the drivers behind the recent price surge, and investigate the methodology used for the long-term return prediction.  Consider analyzing the underlying fundamentals of the gold and copper markets, along with NEM's specific business operations and future outlook, to form a more complete investment thesis.
