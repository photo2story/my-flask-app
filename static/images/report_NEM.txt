**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings show growth in revenue, the negative CAGR, high negative alpha in recent years, and volatile profit margins and ROE raise concerns.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, although the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions. The -133.1% expected return likely reflects a projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Investors should carefully consider these factors before investing.  Further investigation into the reasons for the substantial underperformance and the unusually low expected return is crucial.  The -8.59% one-day drop requires analysis to identify the causative factors.
