* **20-Day Moving Average:** $46.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $43.90

* **RSI:** 79.35 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.23 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +2.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -165.4% (This negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and needs further investigation. It is likely reflecting the current underperformance and  may not accurately reflect long-term potential.)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, increasing the risk of a price pullback.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term requires further analysis to understand the underlying factors.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's recent financial performance shows signs of improvement in revenue and profitability. However, the stock's significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-78.2%) and the negative long-term expected return are major concerns.  The high RSI suggests caution, indicating potential overvaluation in the short term.  The substantial volatility, as evidenced by the Beta and MDD values, highlights the inherent risk in the gold mining sector.  Before considering a long-term investment, a thorough examination of the factors driving the large negative expected return and the unusual spike in EPS is crucial.  Further analysis of macroeconomic conditions affecting gold prices and NEM's specific competitive landscape is recommended before reaching any conclusions about its investment potential.  The duplicate data entry in the earnings report needs immediate clarification.
