**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Newmont Corporation's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 26.65% for NEM versus 120.91% for VOO. This results in a substantial negative divergence of -94.3%, placing it at the 1.8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  The company has underperformed the market considerably.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-day Moving Average:** $41.46
* **20-day Moving Average:** $41.81
* **60-day Moving Average:** $47.77

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The closing price is notably below the 5 and 20-day averages.  The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average highlights a more considerable decline over the longer term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 29.85 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.53 (Positive, but weak)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.7 (Indicates a recent short-term downturn)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that, based on the provided data, no significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term.  Additional data or forecasting would be needed to provide a more informed estimate)


Given the current price ($40.22) is significantly below recent moving averages and the relative divergence indicates a short term downturn, it's crucial to consider that this does not necessarily signal a significant upturn is imminent.  A continued downward trend is equally possible.
