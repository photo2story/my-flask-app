**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $42.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $42.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $44.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $41.77

The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.23  (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially signaling a buying opportunity, although this needs further confirmation)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.42 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** 2.7 (+), indicating a short-term upward trend.  The price change of $0.95 ($42.51 - $42.11) from the previous close is relatively small and does not indicate a significant price jump (neither a sharp uptrend nor a sharp downtrend).

**Expected Return:** -154.4%  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is concerning and warrants further investigation.  It likely reflects the current market sentiment regarding NEM's future prospects.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NEM's performance has been significantly below that of the S&P 500 recently. While recent earnings show improvement and the company shows positive financial health, the extremely negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern. The stock shows signs of short-term volatility.  Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying reasons for the poor relative performance and to assess the accuracy and reliability of the -154.4% expected return figure before making any investment decisions.  Consideration should also be given to resolving inconsistencies in the provided data (e.g., duplicate entries in earnings data).  A thorough fundamental analysis including a review of industry trends, future gold and copper price projections, and the company's operational efficiency is crucial before making any investment decisions.
