## Newmont Corporation (NEM) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Newmont Corporation (NEM), a leading gold producer and mining company, shows a cumulative return of 31.03% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%.  This results in a significant divergence of -87.3%.  The relative divergence of 6.4% indicates that NEM's performance is relatively low compared to the S&P 500, placing it in the lower range of historical performance differences.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $41.67
* **5-day Moving Average:** $40.80
* **20-day Moving Average:** $38.71
* **60-day Moving Average:** $42.09

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential pullback from recent highs.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (75.64):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential near-term correction.
* **PPO (1.61):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although the RSI suggests caution.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+0.9):** Shows short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (-252.2%):**  This extremely negative expected return (relative to the S&P 500 over the long term) is a significant red flag and warrants further investigation.  It suggests a substantially lower projected return than the S&P 500 over a period of two years or more.  The reason for such a drastically negative projection needs to be clarified.  Given the other data, this forecast seems improbable.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.80  | $4.61B      |

| 2024-10-24 | $0.20  | $2.49B      | *(Duplicate Entry, likely an error)*

Earnings show a significant increase in EPS and revenue in the second and third quarters of 2024 compared to previous quarters. However, there's a duplicate entry for October 2024, suggesting potential data inconsistencies that need clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2023-12-31  | $3.96B  | 24.59%        |
| 2023-09-30  | $2.49B  | 25.75%        |

Revenue has been generally increasing, though profit margins fluctuate.  The higher profit margins in Q2 and Q3 2024 are positive.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity    | ROE     |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | $29.71B  | 3.10%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $29.38B  | 2.90%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $28.89B  | 0.59%   |
| 2023-12-31  | $29.03B  | -10.88%  |
| 2023-09-30  | $19.07B  | 0.83%   |

Equity has generally increased, but ROE shows significant volatility, with a negative value in Q4 2023.  This needs further investigation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEM's recent financial performance shows positive growth in revenue and EPS. However, the extremely negative long-term expected return (-252.2%) is concerning and requires careful scrutiny. This projected return is almost certainly an error and should be disregarded.  The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, and caution is warranted.  Further investigation is needed to understand the discrepancies in the data (duplicate earnings entry, volatile ROE, and the unusually negative projected return).  Before considering any investment, it is crucial to clarify the inconsistencies in the data and perform a more thorough analysis, including an examination of the gold market's outlook and NEM's competitive landscape.  The provided data alone does not offer a clear buy or sell recommendation.
