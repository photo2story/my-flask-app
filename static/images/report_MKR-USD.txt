2025-12-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the Maker (MKR-USD) data provided, along with comparisons to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Overview & Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Maker is a decentralized credit platform on the Ethereum blockchain that supports the DAI stablecoin.
*   **MKR Cumulative Return:** 397.97%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 79.55%
*   **Divergence:** 321.6 (Relative Divergence: 28.2)

**Analysis:** MKR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The divergence of 321.6 is substantial, indicating a much higher return for MKR over the period. However, the relative divergence of 28.2 suggests that the current divergence is relatively low compared to historical divergence.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|----------|------|--------|

| 2019-2021  | 723.0%  | 80.0% | 677.0%   | -0.0 | 0.0    |
| 2020-2022  | 101.0%  | 80.0% | 102.0%   | 0.0  | 0.0    |
| 2021-2023  | -12.0%  | 79.5% | -13.0%   | 0.0  | 0.0    |

| 2023-2025  | 250.0%  | 79.2% | 185.0%   | 0.2  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Highly volatile. Shows periods of significant losses (e.g., -78% from 2018-2020) and gains (e.g., 723% from 2019-2021).  This highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of MKR.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD (around 80%) across all periods indicates significant price volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is also highly volatile and generally positive when CAGR is positive, indicating that MKR's returns are often exceeding what would be expected based on market movements (S&P 500).
*   **Beta:** Beta values are very low, close to zero, suggesting that MKR's price movements are not highly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This could be because it's in the crypto space, which can move independently from traditional stocks.
*   **Cap(B):** Zero values suggest that the provided data does not have market capitalization information in billions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 1757.79
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 1807.2725, 'previousClose': 1833.649, 'change': -1.44}
*   **5-day SMA:** 1764.07
*   **20-day SMA:** 1718.48
*   **60-day SMA:** 1771.29

**Analysis:** The stock price closed lower than the previous close, with a negative change. The 5-day SMA is slightly above the 20-day SMA, suggesting a recent upward trend. The 60-day SMA is the highest, indicating a longer-term trend could be sideways. MKR is trading slightly below its 5-day and 60-day SMA, but above its 20-day SMA.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended) - Suggests moderate risk based on this indicator.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 49.75 - This is near the neutral level (50), implying neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.80 -  Indicates a slight upward price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.1 (Negative) - This suggests a short-term downward trend relative to the comparison asset.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1057.6 - This is a very high expected return, suggesting significant potential upside if held long-term.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests that MKR is a medium-risk investment based on their criteria.
*   The RSI near 50 indicates neutral momentum.
*   The PPO indicates an upward trend.
*   The negative change in relative divergence hints at short-term underperformance compared to VOO.
*   The extremely high expected return should be viewed with caution, as it's likely based on historical volatility and may not be sustainable.
*   Important : Fluctuation issue (sharp rebound, sharp decline)

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   Most headlines relate to Dogecoin, Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin (BTC) rather than Maker (MKR). There is one related news on CoinMarketCap from 2017.
*   **Key takeaways from the news headlines:**
    *   **Dogecoin & XRP:** Mentions of Dogecoin and XRP being "millionaire makers" or potential rallies should be viewed with extreme skepticism. The crypto market is highly speculative, and such claims are often unsubstantiated.
    *   **Tokenization:** The article about the "$16 Trillion Tokenization Era" is relevant. It suggests a growing interest in tokenizing real-world assets, which could potentially benefit platforms like Maker.
    *   **Trump Tariffs & Crypto:** The article about Trump's tariffs affecting crypto markets highlights the potential impact of macroeconomic events on the crypto space.
