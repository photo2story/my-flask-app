2025-12-17 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided data for Maker (MKR-USD), along with a comparison to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Divergence:**

*   **Ticker:** MKR-USD (Maker)
*   **Company Overview:** Maker is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that created the Dai stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.
*   **MKR Cumulative Return:** 298.75%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 78.77%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 342.5
    *   Min: -53.7
    *   Max: 1275.9
    *   Relative Divergence: 29.8

*   **Analysis:** MKR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The current divergence of 342.5 units represents a substantial difference in cumulative returns. However, the relative divergence of 29.8 suggests that, while significant, the current divergence is still at the lower end of its historical range (Min: -53.7, Max: 1275.9). This suggests that it is not at its peak overperformance compared to its history.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows the average annual growth rate over different periods.  MKR's CAGR has fluctuated wildly, ranging from negative to very high positive values, demonstrating its volatile nature.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. The MDD is consistently high, indicating significant risk of loss.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark index (presumably the S&P 500 in this case). A positive alpha indicates outperformance, while a negative alpha indicates underperformance. MKR's alpha is highly variable, aligning with its volatile returns.
*   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the benchmark index. A beta of 1 indicates that the investment's price will move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the investment is more volatile than the market, and a beta less than 1 indicates that the investment is less volatile than the market. MKR's beta is close to zero for most periods, suggesting it is not strongly correlated with the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions. Always 0.0.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 1406.95
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 1406.94, Previous Close: 1860.15, Change: -24.36%
*   **5-day SMA:** 1743.34
*   **20-day SMA:** 1788.88
*   **60-day SMA:** 1766.04

*   **Analysis:** The price has recently experienced a significant drop (-24.36%). All SMAs are above the current price, indicating a potential downtrend in the short to medium term. The fact that the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA suggests a short-term bearish trend, while the 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, suggesting a medium-term bearish trend.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 32.17 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.53
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.9 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 979.9%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI of 0.7:** Suggests a medium level of risk.
    *   **RSI of 32.17:** Indicates that MKR is currently oversold, which could signal a potential buying opportunity (but also means that it can be bought further).
    *   **PPO of -1.53:** Suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the current downward trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests that it is in "Buy" territory with a 0% cash ratio. However, this is contradictory to the other indicators.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** Despite the recent price drop, there has been a short-term rise in relative divergence, suggesting it is not as bad as it looks.
    *   **Expected Return:** A 979.9% expected return is extremely high and should be viewed with skepticism. This assumes a continued high growth rate and doesn't account for the high volatility of MKR.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines touch on various aspects of the cryptocurrency market, including:
    *   Dogecoin's potential as a "millionaire maker"
    *   Maker (MKR) price spikes and potential for further increase
    *   Tokenization trends and their impact on the market
    *   Ripple XRP's price predictions and potential as a "millionaire-maker"
    *   Historical Maker price data

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The news headlines suggest that MKR is part of a broader cryptocurrency market trend, and its price movements are influenced by factors affecting the entire sector.
    *   The mention of "millionaire maker" cryptocurrencies and price predictions should be taken with caution, as they are often speculative and do not guarantee future returns.
    *   The news regarding tokenization trends is relevant to MKR, as it operates within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and could benefit from the increasing adoption of tokenized assets.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   Analyst Consensus: N/A (no data provided)

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** MKR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, but is currently experiencing a sharp downturn. The recent price drop has pushed the RSI into oversold territory, but other indicators suggest a continued downtrend. The high MDD and volatile CAGR indicate that MKR is a high-risk investment. The extremely high "expected return" is likely overly optimistic.
*   **Risk Considerations:** The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and MKR is no exception. The high MDD indicates a substantial risk of loss. The lack of strong correlation with the S&P 500 (low Beta) means that MKR's price movements may not be tied to the overall market.
*   **News Impact:** The news headlines provide a general overview of the cryptocurrency market, but do not offer specific insights into MKR's future performance. The emphasis on "millionaire maker" cryptocurrencies highlights the speculative nature of the market and the need for caution.
*   **Overall Conclusion:**  MKR presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. While the potential for significant returns exists, investors should be prepared for substantial price swings and potential losses. The recent price decline could represent a buying opportunity for those with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon, especially given the oversold RSI. However, a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market and MKR's underlying technology is essential before making any investment decisions. Due to the hybrid signal recommendation, it may be safe to buy a few shares or invest a small amount of funds for the long-term.
