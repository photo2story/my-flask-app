**Analysis of Performance vs. S&P 500:**

*   MKR-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return.

*   The Alpha/Beta table shows varying performance across different periods.  Note the extremely high Alpha during 2019-2021. The Beta values are consistently near zero, suggesting MKR-USD's returns are largely independent of the S&P 500. The high MDD indicates high volatility.
