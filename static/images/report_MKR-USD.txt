| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -26.0% | 69.6%  | -35.0%  | -0.0  | 0.0    |

| 2020-2022  | 101.0% | 80.0%  | 102.0%  | 0.0   | 0.0    |
| 2021-2023  | -12.0% | 79.5%  | -13.0%  | 0.0   | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024  | -62.0% | 79.2%  | -83.0%  | 0.0   | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 284.0% | 79.2%  | 221.0%  | 0.2   | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Varies significantly, showing periods of substantial growth (e.g., 723.0% in 2019-2021, 284.0% in 2023-2025) and sharp declines (e.g., -78.0% in 2018-2020, -62.0% in 2022-2024). This indicates high volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, around 70-80%, reflecting the inherent risk in this investment, particularly in a volatile crypto market.
*   **Alpha:** Fluctuates widely, mirroring the CAGR. Positive alpha indicates outperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500), while negative alpha signifies underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Remains consistently low, close to 0. This suggests that MKR-USD's returns are not closely correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). The latest beta for 2023-2025 is 0.2, suggesting a slightly higher correlation but still relatively low.
*   **Cap (B):** All values are 0.0, which might indicate missing or incomplete data regarding the market capitalization or the specific calculation being used is not applicable here.

**Interpretation:**

*   **High Volatility:** The wide swings in CAGR and high MDD values clearly show that MKR-USD is a high-volatility investment.
*   **Inconsistent Performance:** Performance varies greatly depending on the period, with booms and busts.
*   **Low Correlation with Market:** The consistently low Beta values suggest that MKR-USD behaves independently of the broader market. This could be due to its unique position as a governance token within the MakerDAO ecosystem.
*   **Alpha-Driven Returns:** The high positive Alpha values in certain periods (like 2019-2021 and 2023-2025) suggest that when MKR-USD does well, it significantly outperforms the market. Conversely, the negative Alpha in other periods shows significant underperformance.
**Relative Divergence Analysis:** The relative divergence of 30.5 indicates that the current outperformance of MKR-USD compared to VOO is in the lower range of its historical divergence. This suggests there may be room for further outperformance if historical patterns continue. However, it's crucial to consider the high volatility and other risk factors.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **20-day Moving Average:** 1804.57
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 1770.91

**Analysis:** The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend in the short, medium, and long term. The slight increase in the last market data (price: 1845.3014, previousClose: 1838.1616, change: 0.39) indicates a marginal positive movement.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 51.01
*   **PPO:** 0.1981
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 921.3% (long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI (0.9) suggests the model views the market environment as favorable for investment, but remember this is just one indicator.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 51.01 indicates a neutral condition, not overbought or oversold.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO (0.1981) reinforces the upward trend.
*   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence indicates a recent weakening in MKR's outperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Last Market Data:** The market data {'price': 1845.3014, 'previousClose': 1838.1616, 'change': 0.39} indicates a small positive change, reflecting some upward price pressure, but is not a major event signaling a drastic shift.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (921.3%) should be viewed with caution. Such projections are highly speculative and depend on numerous factors.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   The news headlines are mostly unrelated to Maker or cryptocurrency specifically. There is a general market article ("Magnificent Seven surpass EU GDP") that may indirectly affect sentiment toward tech-related assets, including crypto. The remaining articles are irrelevant.

**5. Overall Summary & Recommendation**

**Summary:**

Maker (MKR-USD) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but this outperformance has been highly volatile. Recent price action is positive, with the price above key moving averages. The MRI suggests a favorable market environment, but the recent decline in relative divergence warrants attention. The projected long-term return is exceptionally high but should be taken with a grain of salt.

**Recommendation:**

The Hybrid Signal suggests buying 100% with the MRI 0.9 being Very Safe; however, I would still approach MKR-USD with caution, considering its volatility. It is crucial to consider high volatility and other risk factors. If I have to give an answer then:

*   **For existing holders:** Consider taking some profits or setting tighter stop-loss orders to protect against potential downside.
*   **For potential investors:** Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk.
