**5. Overall Analysis & Recommendation:**

MKR-USD has demonstrated substantial historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but its high volatility and recent indicators suggest caution.

Review your portfolio allocation and risk tolerance. Diversification is highly recommended.  Without analyst consensus, it is difficult to compare other expert's ideas.
