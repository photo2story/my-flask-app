**Analysis:**

*   **Volatility:** The data shows significant volatility in MKR-USD's performance, with both very high positive and negative CAGRs across different periods. This is also reflected in the relatively high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures, indicating periods of significant loss.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are also highly variable, reflecting MKR's ability to generate returns independent of the market (represented by the S&P 500). The high positive alpha in 2019-2021 shows a period of exceptional outperformance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are consistently above 1, suggesting that MKR-USD is more volatile than the overall market. This means it tends to amplify market movements, both positive and negative. The fact that Beta is higher in the middle periods and lower in the first and last periods suggests that it is less volatile than in the past but trending upward.
*   **Risk/Reward:** The high CAGR in some periods is countered by the high MDD, indicating that MKR-USD investments carry substantial risk.
