*   **Accumulated Return (MKR-USD):** 428.54%
*   **Accumulated Return (VOO):** 75.39%
*   **Relative Divergence:**
    *   Current: 359.3
    *   Relative Divergence (Current Position within Range): 31.1%

**Analysis of Table:**
The table provides an overview of the performance of the investment over various three-year periods, analyzing key metrics such as CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, and Beta. Here's a breakdown:

*   **CAGR**: The Compound Annual Growth Rate represents the average annual growth rate of the investment over the specified period, assuming profits are reinvested. The CAGR values vary significantly across different periods, ranging from -78.0% to 723.0%, indicating high volatility.
*   **MDD**: The Maximum Drawdown measures the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, indicating the risk of loss. The MDD values are consistently high, around 70-80%, suggesting substantial risk.
*   **Alpha**: Alpha measures the performance of the investment relative to a benchmark (in this case, likely the S&P 500). Positive Alpha values indicate outperformance, while negative values suggest underperformance.
*   **Beta**: Beta measures the volatility of the investment relative to the market. A Beta of 0 suggests the investment's price is not correlated with the market.
*   **Cap(B)**: The values are consistently 0.0, indicating that the data is not available or relevant in this context.

**Analysis:**
1.  **Volatility**: The investment is highly volatile, as evidenced by the wide range of CAGR values and high MDD percentages.
2.  **Inconsistent Performance**: The investment's performance varies significantly across different periods, indicating that it is influenced by various factors, and consistent returns are not guaranteed.
3.  **Market Independence**: The Beta values consistently being 0.0 suggest that the investment's price is not correlated with the market.

**Simple Explanation:**
*   This investment has had periods of very high growth and periods of significant losses.
*   It is not closely tied to the performance of the overall stock market (S&P 500).
*   Investors should be prepared for large swings in value.

**Summary:**

*   MKR-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.
*   However, the high relative divergence range (min to max) signifies considerable volatility. The current position at 31.1% suggests performance, while still positive, is closer to the lower end of its historical range.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment Recommended" level of risk, indicating the asset is not overly risky.
*   **RSI & PPO:** The RSI is neutral, and the PPO is slightly bearish, but not strongly so. These indicators suggest a period of consolidation or a mild pullback might be possible.
*   **Hybrid Signal & Expected Return:** The "Buy" signal and the extremely high expected return (899.3%) are highly optimistic and should be viewed with caution. Such high returns are unlikely to be sustained indefinitely.
*   **Price Change Impact:** The significant positive price change of 3.66% confirms the short-term upward momentum.

**4. Recent News & Analyst Opinions:**

*   **News:** "US lawmaker says licensing deal for TikTok algorithm would raise serious concerns" - This is likely an indirect risk. If regulatory scrutiny increases on tech and crypto, it *could* impact Maker.

**5. Overall Analysis & Recommendation:**

**Summary:**

Maker (MKR-USD) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Strengths:** Significant historical outperformance vs. S&P 500, recent positive price momentum, "Buy" signal from the hybrid indicator, and a high (though potentially unrealistic) expected return.
*   **Weaknesses:** High volatility (demonstrated by MDD and relative divergence range), regulatory risks (as highlighted by the news), and the absence of recent analyst consensus.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Cautiously Optimistic:** The recent price action and hybrid signal suggest a potential for continued growth.
*   **Risk Management is Crucial:**  Due to the high volatility, position sizing should be conservative.  Don't allocate a large portion of your portfolio to MKR-USD.

*   **Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging:** Given the volatility, a strategy of regular, smaller investments (dollar-cost averaging) might be preferable to a large lump-sum investment.
*   **Temper Expectations:**  The 899.3% expected return is highly optimistic.  It's wise to have more conservative growth targets.
