*   **Expected Return (%):** 208.76%
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation.
    *   The RSI is nearing oversold territory (below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity if you believe the stock is fundamentally strong. *However, oversold doesn't always mean a rebound is imminent.*
    *   The negative PPO confirms the recent downward momentum suggested by the SMAs.
    *   The Hybrid Signal advocates a full investment of available cash, with a suggested monthly investment.
    *   The recent negative change in relative divergence aligns with the short-term downtrend observed in the SMAs.
    *   The exceptionally high Expected Return (208.76%) suggests significant potential upside, but this should be viewed cautiously. It reflects the stock's historical high growth, but past performance is not indicative of future results. This figure needs to be considered in light of the risk factors.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

TransMedics Group Inc. (TMDX) has demonstrated exceptional growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this growth has come with significant volatility, as indicated by high MDD and Beta values.
