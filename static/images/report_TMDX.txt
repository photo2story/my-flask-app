*   **TMDX Cumulative Return:** 199.45%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 70.76%
*   **Divergence:** 128.7
*   **Relative Divergence:** 62.2

**Analysis:** TMDX has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period for which cumulative return data is available. The divergence of 128.7 indicates a substantial difference in performance.  A relative divergence of 62.2 suggests that the current outperformance is positioned more towards the middle of its historical range, rather than being at an extreme high.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | 94.0%   | 60.2%   | 96.0%   | 1.3   | 2.2    |
| 2021-2023  | 65.0%   | 60.2%   | 64.0%   | 1.7   | 2.8    |
| 2022-2024  | 130.0%  | 51.7%   | 111.0%  | 1.8   | 2.2    |
| 2023-2025  | 120.0%  | 53.4%   | 58.0%   | 1.4   | 4.3    |

**Analysis:**  TMDX exhibits high growth (CAGR) across different periods but also experiences significant drawdowns (MDD).  The consistently positive and high Alpha values indicate that TMDX is generating returns above what would be expected based on its beta.  The Beta values, consistently above 1, suggest that the stock is more volatile than the market and amplifies market movements. The market cap has shown steady growth over time, indicating increasing investor confidence.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 122.69
*   **Last Market:** Price: 126.28, Previous Close: 122.69, Change: 2.93
*   **5-day SMA:** 122.704
*   **20-day SMA:** 127.454
*   **60-day SMA:** 126.3023

**Analysis:** The stock price increased at the end of the most recent market, and the 5-day SMA is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs.  This might indicate a potential short-term upward trend after a period of price correction as the price rebounds towards the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. It could also indicate a brief upward blip without necessarily reversing a downward trend.

**3) Indicators Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.99
*   **PPO:** -0.64
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (7 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.2% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -3.1 (short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 56.4% (excess compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.  The RSI of 40.99 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity.  The negative PPO (-0.64) suggests that the stock's short-term moving average is below its long-term moving average, generally indicating a bearish trend, although the values are small. The hybrid signal recommends investing all available cash and indicates the stock is very safe according to its model. However, this contradicts the PPO value. The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days supports the possibility of short-term decline. The expected return of 56.4% is very high and suggests significant potential upside.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Trial Outlook (Dec 22, 2025):**  Piper Sandler sees upside potential based on a heart trial. This is a positive catalyst.
*   **Earnings Beat but Stock Falls (Oct 30, 2025):** Q3 earnings beat estimates, but the stock still fell. This could suggest underlying concerns about future performance or market sentiment.

*   **Target Price:** Avg: 144.73 / High: 170.00 / Low: 114.00

Lack of information of the direction of recent rating changes limits ability to assess changes in sentiment.

*   **Mixed Technical Indicators:** The RSI is approaching oversold, while the PPO is slightly negative, presenting a mixed signal.
*   **Insider Sales:**  Recent insider sales could raise concerns.
*   **Inconsistent Hybrid Signal:** Contradictory information between PPO and the model behind the hybrid signal indicates caution is warranted.

**Conclusion:**

TMDX appears to be a growth-oriented stock with high potential returns but also significant risk. The positive analyst sentiment, news coverage, and expected return suggest a bullish outlook. However, investors should be aware of the stock's volatility, potential for drawdowns, recent insider sales, and the contradictory technical signals. The medium MRI suggests the investment is not low risk and should only be undertaken by investors with a reasonable risk tolerance. **Further research is recommended to investigate the reasons for the recent stock price drop, insider sales, and the discrepancy between the short-term market trend and the long-term outlook.**
