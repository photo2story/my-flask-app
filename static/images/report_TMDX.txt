    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows strong growth in recent periods (2020-2025). The CAGR has been consistently high.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD indicates a substantial level of risk and volatility inherent in TMDX, with drawdowns exceeding 80% in all periods. This suggests significant price swings are common.

    *   **Beta:** A beta close to 0, especially in earlier periods, suggests TMDX's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). However, the Beta has slightly increased to 0.3 in 2023-2025, indicating a more moderate correlation with the market.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has been increasing over the years.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI of 0.7 suggests a moderate level of risk associated with the investment.
    *   The RSI of 25.77 indicates the stock is currently oversold, which could signal a potential buying opportunity if you believe in the long-term fundamentals.
    *   The negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a possible downtrend, although the recent price increase may be changing this.
    *   The "Buy" hybrid signal, coupled with a high MRI (0.90), is particularly noteworthy and indicates a positive, conservative signal.
    *   A recent increase in divergence indicates short-term gains versus the S&P 500.
