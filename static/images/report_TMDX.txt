    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate varies significantly across the periods, demonstrating volatility. More recent periods (2022-2025) show strong growth.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and price fluctuation.

    *   **Beta:** Beta is low, and the low figure shows low correlation to the overall market. It means it is less sensitive to market changes.
    *   **Cap(B):** It gradually increases to 4.4. It indicates potential growth.

*   20-day SMA: 134.2503
*   60-day SMA: 124.8776

    *   The 5-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, which is below the 20-day SMA.  This suggests a possible short-term upward trend after a recent dip.  The price increase on the last trading day supports this.

*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -7.1 (Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return (%): 49.8 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

    *   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   The RSI indicates the stock is currently oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, though it could also indicate continued downward momentum.
    *   The PPO supports the short-term downtrend indicated by the declining relative divergence.
