2024-12-08 - Analysis Report
## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-hailing and food delivery company.

The cumulative return for UBER is 68.96%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 92.99%.  This results in a difference of **-24.03%**.  The relative divergence of -24.03% is positioned at the 36.4th percentile relative to historical data, indicating it's underperformed the S&P 500 but not exceptionally so compared to its past performance range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance against the market (negative alpha) and high beta (above 1 in most periods, indicating higher volatility than the market), particularly during 2020-2022.  The most recent period (2022-2024) shows significantly improved CAGR (71%), but this needs to be considered in context with the earlier periods' underperformance.  Market capitalization has increased steadily over the reported period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $66.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $69.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $74.71

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The last market price of $66.15 is also below these averages, reinforcing this bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.92 (Below 30 indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.48 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -12.7% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates no expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term based on the provided data.  This should not be interpreted as a prediction, but rather reflects a lack of prediction within the provided data.)

The RSI value suggests the stock might be oversold, potentially indicating a bounce is possible. However, the negative PPO and the downward trend in relative divergence reinforce the bearish signal.  The given Expected Return of 0% does not account for potential long-term growth inherent in the company or the market.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Uber consistently beat EPS expectations in the last four quarters (Q1 2024, Q2 2024, Q3 2024, Q4 2023), however the magnitude of the beats vary significantly.  Q1 2024 showed a considerable positive surprise, whereas other quarters showed more modest positive surprises.  It's important to note that EPS was negative in Q2 2023. This suggests improving profitability, but volatility remains.  Analysis of revenue growth trends requires additional data beyond EPS reports.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a steady upward trend, indicating consistent growth. Profit margins are consistently high and stable, hovering around 39%.  This suggests strong operational efficiency and pricing power.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has increased significantly (though with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation), indicating strong financial health.  Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile, showing periods of strong profitability (high ROE) and periods of less profitability (low or negative ROE). This volatility likely reflects the company's growth phase and operational investments.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**  This section requires access to real-time news sources to provide information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions within the last two days.  This analysis cannot be completed without that information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows signs of both strength and weakness.  Revenue and profit margins are consistently strong, indicating a healthy business model.  However, the stock is currently trading below its moving averages, and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  Recent earnings beats are positive, but the volatility in ROE and the overall underperformance against the S&P 500 over the evaluated period need to be carefully considered.  The lack of positive expected returns based on the provided data raises concerns about long-term outperformance. Further research, especially considering the missing news and analyst sentiment, is crucial before making investment decisions. The high beta implies higher risk associated with the investment.
