2024-12-28 - Analysis Report
## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a transportation network company providing ride-sharing and food delivery services.

As of the last day of the provided data, UBER's cumulative return (57.38%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (91.44%). The difference is -34.1%, placing it at the 29.1st percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-74% to +63.2%).  The alpha consistently registers negatively (-0.1) across all periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark. The beta, however, shows high volatility, ranging from 52 to 88, suggesting UBER's price movements are significantly more sensitive to market fluctuations than the S&P 500.  While recent periods show positive CAGR (60% from 2022-2024),  the large maximum drawdown (MDD) values highlight considerable risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $61.56
* **Last Market Price:** $61.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $61.216
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $64.6605
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $71.8935

The stock is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages suggests potential for further downside.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (34.41):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound. However, this should be considered alongside other factors.

* **PPO (0.0853):** A positive value suggests a bullish trend, though relatively weak.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-3.8%):** Shows a recent downward trend in relative performance against the market.

* **Expected Return (-61.3%):** This indicates a significant projected underperformance against the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming current trends continue.  A price of $61.13 does not significantly alter this outlook, as it falls within the existing bearish trend. There is no evidence of a recent sharp reversal (either up or down).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Uber consistently exceeded EPS expectations in the last four quarters, displaying significant positive surprises.  However, the previous quarter (2024-05-08) shows a substantial negative EPS (-$0.32), contrasting with both the positive trend and the expectations.  While we see a clear upward trend in reported EPS from Q1 2024 onwards, this volatility remains a cause for concern.  The table only provides EPS data, not revenue figures, hindering a complete revenue growth trend analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Shows consistent quarterly revenue growth, indicating a healthy expansion of the business.

* **Profit Margin:** Remains relatively stable and high, around 39%, suggesting strong profitability.

* **Equity and ROE:**  Equity shows considerable fluctuation, while ROE is volatile and even negative in Q1 2024.  This suggests potential risks in the capital structure and profitability. The large jump in equity in Q3 2024 is notable and warrants further investigation beyond the data provided.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to be populated.  Without this data, a thorough analysis cannot be conducted.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows signs of growth in revenue and occasional positive EPS surprises. However, its performance significantly lags the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and considerable risk, as evidenced by its large maximum drawdowns. The negative alpha consistently suggests underperformance against the market. While recent quarters show improvements in earnings and revenue, the volatility in ROE and equity, coupled with the negative long-term expected return, raises serious concerns about long-term investment viability.  Further analysis is needed to incorporate recent news and analyst opinions to provide a more complete assessment. The considerable negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant red flag.  Additional financial data, such as revenue figures corresponding to the provided EPS data and details regarding the Q3 2024 equity jump, would significantly enhance the analysis.
