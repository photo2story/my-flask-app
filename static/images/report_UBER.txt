**1. Performance Comparison:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a provider of transportation services and food delivery.  Over the analyzed period, UBER significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a 12.1% higher cumulative return.  However, the provided relative divergence suggests that while currently outperforming, this level of outperformance is not unprecedented historically.  The alpha and beta analysis in the table below shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (negative alpha in most periods, high beta implying high volatility).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 2.0% | 11.0% | -68.0% | -0.1 | 87.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -35.0% | 23.9% | -43.0% | -0.3 | 51.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 23.9% | 1.0% | -1.0 | 128.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 56.0% | 23.9% | 24.0% | -1.0 | 126.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 103.0% | 15.5% | 54.0% | -1.1 | 159.3 |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $75.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $77.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.94

The price is currently below its 20-day moving average, suggesting potential downward pressure.  However, it is above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating some short-term support.  The recent 1.75% price increase should be considered within this context.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (41.98):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to the oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.84):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +5.1%, suggesting short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -14.4% This indicates a projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This is a crucial point to consider for long-term investment decisions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |

| 2024-02-07 | 0.66    | 0.17         | +0.49      |

Uber has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, except for Q2 2024. This positive trend suggests strong operational performance and potential for future growth.  However, the large discrepancies between actual and expected EPS highlight the volatility and uncertainty surrounding Uber's earnings.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UBER has shown strong cumulative returns outperforming the S&P 500 in the given period, with consistently high revenue and profit margins.  However, the relatively high volatility (high beta) and negative alpha in many periods, coupled with a projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-14.4%), suggest a high-risk, high-reward investment. The recent earnings beat expectations, but inconsistent ROE and fluctuating price action indicate uncertainty.  A long-term investment decision should carefully consider this risk profile and the potential for significant market fluctuations.  Further research into the company's long-term growth prospects and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.
