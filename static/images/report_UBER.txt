2025-04-11 - Analysis Report
## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Stock Report

This report analyzes Uber Technologies Inc., a global ride-hailing and food delivery company.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Uber's cumulative return is 42.67%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 22.54% return.  The difference is 20.1%, placing it at the 73.6th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (max difference: 46.6%, min difference: -53.7%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  While beta consistently indicates high sensitivity to market movements (above 50, generally considered high beta), alpha (a measure of excess return) fluctuates, sometimes positive, sometimes negative, suggesting inconsistent outperformance relative to the market. The higher beta is consistent with the high volatility of Uber's stock. The increasing CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over time suggests positive growth trend. However, the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) remains relatively high, highlighting the inherent risk in investing in UBER. Market capitalization also shows a positive trend.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | -5.0% | 63.6% | -37.0% | -0.0 | 86.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -34.0% | 68.7% | -36.0% | 0.1 | 50.8 |
| 2021-2023  | 13.0% | 70.5% | 3.0% | 0.0 | 126.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 43.0% | 72.6% | 29.0% | -0.1 | 124.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 58.0% | 79.3% | 51.0% | 0.7 | 149.4 |

The price is slightly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term correction. The 5-day moving average being significantly lower indicates recent price weakness. The last market price drop of $1.54 is noteworthy and suggests a short-term bearish trend.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Uber has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, particularly in the last two quarters. However, there was a significant negative EPS in Q2 2024. The substantial difference between actual and expected EPS suggests either market underestimation or the company exceeding internal projections.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21   | 0.5          |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2    | 0.41         |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47   | 0.31         |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32  | 0.2203       |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66   | 0.17         |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows steady growth throughout the past year. Profit margins remain consistently high, indicating strong operational efficiency.  Equity and ROE show fluctuations, with a significant drop in ROE during Q1 2024 followed by strong recovery.  This volatility needs further investigation into the underlying causes, which are beyond the scope of this simple analysis.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $11.96B  | 39.51%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $11.19B  | 39.57%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $10.70B  | 39.36%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $10.13B  | 39.12%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.94B   | 39.04%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE     |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.56B  | 31.93%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78B  | 17.67%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.35B  | 8.22%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.06B  | -5.91%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $11.25B  | 12.70%  |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Uber shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins. However, the stock's high beta indicates significant market sensitivity. Recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations. While short-term price movements suggest potential volatility, the long-term outlook appears positive given the consistent revenue growth and recent earnings surprises, although this should be balanced against the relatively high MDD. The significant difference between the company's cumulative return and that of the S&P 500 supports this assessment.  Further investigation into the causes of the fluctuations in ROE would provide a more complete picture.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in UBER.
