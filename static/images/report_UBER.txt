## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Investment Report

This report analyzes Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) based on the provided data.  Uber Technologies Inc. is a transportation network company providing ride-hailing services and food delivery through its Uber Eats platform.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Uber's cumulative return of 60.56% lags behind the S&P 500's cumulative return of 84.41% by 23.8 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -23.8% places it at the 36.6th percentile of its historical range (max: +63.2%, min: -74%). This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently shows negative values, further confirming underperformance relative to the market benchmark.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $63.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $61.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $62.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $71.07

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend. The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day moving average implies a notable price decline in the last two months.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.78 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.59 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +7.2% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -43.0% (Significantly lower than S&P 500 over the long term).  The current price of $63.15 doesn't appear to reflect a significant recent event causing a sharp price increase or decrease.  Given the large negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 (-43%),  the current price might be overvalued considering the long-term outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Uber has shown significant EPS improvement compared to expectations in recent quarters.  There's a clear upward trend in EPS, especially in the last two quarters (Q3 and Q4 2024). Notably, the most recent quarter (ending October 31, 2024) showed a substantial beat compared to expectations.

| Date        | EPS    | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss  |

| 2024-10-31  | 1.2    | 0.41          | Significant Beat |
| 2024-08-06  | 0.47   | 0.31          | Beat         |

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue shows consistent quarter-over-quarter growth, indicating a healthy business expansion.  Profit margins are stable and high (around 39%), showing consistent profitability. However, Equity and ROE are more volatile. While ROE has been positive in recent quarters (except Q1 2024), the significant fluctuation might indicate some financial instability and requires further investigation beyond the provided data.  Overall, the financials present a mixed picture â€“ strong revenue growth and high profit margins, but some inconsistencies in equity and ROE.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**  This section requires information not provided in the initial data.  News regarding recent earnings announcements, market outlook, and analyst opinions within the last two days would be needed to complete this section.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Uber shows strong revenue growth and impressive profit margins.  Recent earnings have significantly exceeded expectations. However, the stock's performance lags behind the S&P 500, indicated by a consistently negative alpha.  The long-term expected return is considerably lower than the S&P 500, which needs to be considered.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal;  While the PPO suggests bullish momentum, the price is below its moving averages. The volatility in Equity and ROE warrants further analysis of the company's financial health.  More information is needed on recent news and analyst opinions to provide a complete picture.

**8. Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, a long-term investment in UBER carries significant risk due to the projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While revenue and profitability are strong, the inconsistencies in equity and ROE combined with the negative alpha and significantly lower projected return demand further due diligence before investing.  The current price may be overvalued given the long-term expected return, relative to the S&P 500.  Adding to the uncertainty is the absence of recent news and analyst opinions.  A more thorough analysis including those factors, along with a deeper dive into the financial statements, is strongly recommended before making any investment decision.
