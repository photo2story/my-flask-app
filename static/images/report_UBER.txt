**Conclusion:**

Despite the strong buy consensus and high price targets from analysts, there are significant concerns about UBER's historical underperformance, high volatility, and the extremely negative "Expected Return". Investors should investigate the source and calculation of the "Expected Return" metric and proceed with caution. The recent news is mixed, suggesting uncertainty.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Investigate "Expected Return":** Determine how this figure was calculated and the underlying assumptions. This is a critical red flag.
2.  **Due Diligence on Underperformance:** Understand the reasons for UBER's historical underperformance compared to the S&P 500. Is it company-specific, or related to the broader market environment?
3.  **Monitor Moving Averages:** Keep a close eye on the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. A break above these levels could signal a potential trend reversal.
4.  **Monitor News Flow:** Track news and developments related to UBER, particularly those that could impact its profitability and growth prospects.
5.  **Consider Risk Tolerance:** Given UBER's volatility, assess whether it aligns with your risk tolerance.
6.  **Potentially reduce or sell your shares based on the "Expected Return":** Depending on your risk tolerance and the findings of further investigation of expected return, it would be wise to divest shares.
