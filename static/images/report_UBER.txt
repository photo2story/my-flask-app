**6) Overall Analysis:**

Uber demonstrates strong recent performance, exceeding the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative returns. Positive earnings surprises and consistent revenue growth point towards a healthy financial outlook.  However, the relatively high RSI suggests caution, and the negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 (provided by the model),  coupled with historical periods of underperformance, calls for a balanced perspective.  Further analysis, including a deeper examination of the -16% expected return figure and the underlying assumptions of the model, is needed before making any investment decisions.  A thorough risk assessment considering macroeconomic factors and competitive landscapes is also crucial.
