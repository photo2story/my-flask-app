**0) Summary Statistics:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-hailing and food delivery company.  The provided data shows a significant outperformance of UBER compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period, but with considerable volatility.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $80.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.16

The price is below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The recent price drop of -$2.92 signifies a relatively large negative change.

* **PPO:** 0.79 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) indicating recent short-term downturn.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -15.7% (This indicates a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 for long-term investment.)  The large negative change in price needs to be considered when evaluating this long-term expectation.

| Date       | EPS       | Expected EPS |

| 2024-02-07 | 0.66      | 0.17          |

Uber consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters except for Q2 2024.  The significant EPS increase in Q4 2024 warrants further investigation into the drivers of this growth.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins. However, its stock price exhibits significant volatility, as reflected in the high beta and inconsistent alpha. While recent earnings have been positive, surpassing expectations, the long-term outlook (-15.7% expected return relative to S&P 500) and the price drop need further consideration.  Investors should carefully evaluate the risk tolerance before investing in UBER, given its volatile nature and the potential for significant price swings.  The high short-term RSI suggests potential for a short-term correction.  Further investigation into the drivers of the Q4 2024 EPS surge is warranted before forming a definitive conclusion on the long-term prospects.
