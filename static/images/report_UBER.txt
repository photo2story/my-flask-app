2025-04-05 - Analysis Report
## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a multinational ride-hailing company providing transportation services and food delivery.  The following analysis utilizes provided data for Uber's performance.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Uber's cumulative return (57.57%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (43.30%) by 14.27 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 77.9% indicates that Uber's current outperformance is positioned at the higher end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  However, this doesn't guarantee future outperformance, and historical volatility needs consideration.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile alpha and beta values across different time periods. High beta values indicate higher risk and sensitivity to market fluctuations. While positive alphas suggest outperformance, negative alphas indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The fluctuating alphas highlight the inconsistency in Uber's performance relative to the market.  Note that market capitalization (Cap(B)) also fluctuates, reflecting the dynamic nature of Uber's business.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 4.0% | 59.1% | -69.0% | 0.1 | 87.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -31.0% | 68.7% | -52.0% | 0.2 | 51.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 11.0% | 68.7% | -17.0% | -0.7 | 128.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 52.0% | 72.4% | 37.0% | -1.0 | 126.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 69.0% | 81.3% | -0.1 | 135.1 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

Uber's closing price is $64.62.  The stock has recently experienced a significant decrease (-7.49) from the previous close ($69.85). All moving averages (5-day: 70.96, 20-day: 72.61, 60-day: 72.41) are significantly above the current closing price, indicating a potential downward trend.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.4653 suggests a high-risk investment at the current time.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 32.28 indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce back.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.07 suggests a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent increase of 5.9 in the relative divergence over 20 days implies short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -12.7% indicates a negative expected return.  However, the provided information does not detail the methodology used to calculate this, and long-term (2+ years) potential is discussed below relative to S&P 500.
* **Price Change:** The significant price drop (-7.49) from the previous closing price indicates a sharp decline in the stock price.  This warrants further investigation into the reasons behind this fall.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Uber has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters, except for Q2 2024. However, the significant difference between actual and expected EPS in Q1 2025 warrants further scrutiny to understand the factors contributing to this large positive surprise.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21 | 0.5 |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2 | 0.41 |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47 | 0.31 |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32 | 0.2203 |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66 | 0.17 |

**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows consistent growth, although the rate of growth seems to be slowing. Profit margins remain consistently high (around 39%).  ROE (Return on Equity) is highly variable, reflecting periods of both strong and weak profitability, indicating potential volatility in the future.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $11.96B | 39.51% |
| 2024-09-30 | $11.19B | 39.57% |
| 2024-06-30 | $10.70B | 39.36% |
| 2024-03-31 | $10.13B | 39.12% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.94B | 39.04% |

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.56B | 31.93% |
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78B | 17.67% |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.35B | 8.22% |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.06B | -5.91% |
| 2023-12-31 | $11.25B | 12.70% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Uber's performance shows both strength (high revenue, consistent profit margins, and periods of significant stock appreciation) and significant weaknesses (high volatility, negative expected return currently,  inconsistent profitability reflected in ROE, and high risk as shown by MRI). The recent sharp price drop requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes. The significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over some periods does not guarantee future success.  While long-term (2+ years) investment *could* potentially yield higher returns than the S&P 500 given Uber's growth potential, the substantial risk involved needs careful consideration.  Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, analyzing the reasons behind the recent price decline and assessing the sustainability of Uber's revenue growth and profitability before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the market conditions and the specific reasons behind earnings surprises and the recent price drop is needed for a complete and informed assessment.
