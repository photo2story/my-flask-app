Uber Technologies Inc. is a global mobility and delivery platform connecting drivers and riders, and restaurants and customers.

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **Cumulative Return (UBER):** 34.33%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 75.25%
*   **Absolute Performance Gap:** -39.0%

    This indicates UBER has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period in question.
*   **Relative Performance Gap (Range: -64.2 to 21.6):** 29.4

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -18.0% | 78.6% | -61.0% | 0.1  | 87.3   |
| 2020-2022  | -40.0% | 78.6% | -39.0% | 0.1  | 51.5   |
| 2021-2023  | -3.0%  | 77.8% | -4.0%  | -0.1 | 128.2  |
| 2022-2024  | 34.0%  | 77.8% | 13.0%  | -0.1 | 125.5  |
| 2023-2025  | 54.0%  | 77.8% | -9.0%  | -0.3 | 190.7  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly over different periods, with negative growth in earlier periods and strong positive growth in the more recent 2022-2025 period. This suggests that the stock's performance has improved significantly in recent years.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high across all periods, indicating significant risk and volatility associated with the stock.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is a measure of the stock's performance relative to the benchmark, with negative values indicating underperformance and positive values indicating outperformance. The negative Alpha values in the 2019-2023 periods and in the most recent 2023-2025 period indicate that UBER underperformed its benchmark during these times. However, the positive Alpha value in the 2022-2024 period suggests that UBER outperformed its benchmark during this period.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. The Beta values are generally low, suggesting that UBER is less volatile than the overall market. The negative Beta values in the 2021-2025 periods suggest that UBER's price moves in the opposite direction to the market, which is unusual.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization (Cap) of the company varies over time, indicating changes in the overall value of the company. The significant increase in market capitalization from 2019-2021 to 2023-2025 suggests that the company has grown significantly over the past few years.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Trends

*   **Current Price:** 91.62
*   **Previous Close:** 91.78
*   **Change:** -0.17
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 92.934
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 94.179
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 95.2169

**Analysis:**

The stock price is slightly down from the previous close.  The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day, and both are below the 60-day, indicating a short-term downtrend. The change isn't drastic, so there is no sign of "급반등" or "급하락".

### 3. Technical Indicators and Outlook

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 35.83 (Approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity)
*   **PPO:** -0.3192 (Below zero, indicating a potential downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (Suggests a strong buy signal, but consider the MRI)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** 0.5 (Short-term upward momentum)
*   **Expected Return:** -39.5% (Significant underperformance relative to S&P 500, even with long-term accumulation)

**Analysis:**

The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation.  The RSI is nearing oversold conditions, which *could* signal a potential rebound. However, the PPO indicates a downtrend. The "Hybrid Signal" is strongly bullish, recommending buying with all available cash.  However, the negative "Expected Return" raises serious concerns about long-term prospects relative to the S&P 500.  The recent increase in relative divergence provides a slight, short-term bullish signal.

### 4. Recent News & Events

*   **Bill Ackman Reduces Stake in Alphabet Inc.:**  This is unlikely to directly affect Uber but could reflect a broader shift in investment strategy.
*   **Uber vs. Archer Aviation (Motley Fool):**  Indicates that Uber is being actively compared to other companies in the mobility/transportation space.  This is directly relevant.
*   **Can Uber’s (UBER) Booking Momentum Offset Profitability Pressure? (Insider Monkey):**  This highlights a key challenge for Uber: strong top-line growth (booking momentum) but ongoing concerns about profitability. This is very important.
*   **Serve Robotics' Tie-Up With DoorDash:**  This signals increased competition in the delivery space, though not a direct threat, but DoorDash can threaten Uber Eats.
*   **China-U.S. Robotaxi Race Kicks off in U.K.:** The increased competition within the industry of autonomous mobility.

### 4-2. Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.56)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 110.55 / 150.00 / 82.00

**Analysis:**

Analysts are generally bullish on Uber, with a consensus "Buy" rating and a significantly higher average target price than the current price. The wide range of target prices indicates some uncertainty among analysts.

### 5. Overall Assessment

Overall, the situation is mixed. UBER has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, and the long-term expected return is negative. The stock price has decreased slightly and is below moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend, even though the relative divergence shows some short-term upswing. However, the RSI is approaching oversold, analysts have a bullish outlook, and the "Hybrid Signal" suggests a strong buy.

The most pressing concerns are Uber's profitability issues, as highlighted in the news. While booking momentum is strong, this must translate into sustainable profits to justify a long-term investment. Also, note the maximum drawdown rates within the Alpha/Beta analysis.

**Recommendation:**

Due to the negative "Expected Return", profitability concerns, and high maximum drawdown rates, this investment has risks. Even though there are some positive signals, further research is needed. Pay close attention to the next earnings report and management commentary on the path to profitability. Consider setting a tight stop-loss if you decide to invest, and be prepared for volatility.
