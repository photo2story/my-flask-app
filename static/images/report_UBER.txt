## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-sharing and food delivery company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO).  However, recent indicators suggest a degree of uncertainty.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Uber's cumulative return (42.84%) significantly exceeds the S&P 500's return (26.18%) by 16.7 percentage points. This places it in the 70.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While recent years (2022-2025) show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), earlier periods exhibit negative alpha and high betas (high market sensitivity).  The substantial volatility in Beta indicates high risk associated with the investment.
