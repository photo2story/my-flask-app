Revenue shows consistent growth. Profit margins are stable and high.  ROE fluctuates but demonstrates a trend towards improved profitability.  Note that calculating YoY revenue growth requires data from previous years.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

UBER has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 in recent periods, driven by strong revenue growth and improving profitability. However, its high beta indicates substantial volatility and market sensitivity.  The recent price drop and negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 require careful consideration.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons behind the May 2024 EPS miss and the recent price decline.  The consistently strong EPS beats in other quarters suggest a positive underlying trend.  A long-term investment approach might be appropriate for risk-tolerant investors, but careful monitoring is crucial given the volatility.  The provided data doesn't provide complete information for a conclusive analysis (missing YoY growth figures, specific reasons for price drops and the significant EPS miss in May 2024 are examples).  Additional research is recommended before making any investment decisions.
