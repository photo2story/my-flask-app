## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-hailing and delivery company.  This report analyzes UBER's performance based on provided financial and market data, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO) and assessing its risk and potential return.  Key findings reveal strong recent revenue growth but fluctuating profitability and significant performance divergence from the S&P 500.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **UBER Cumulative Return:** 41.94%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 28.36%
* **Return Difference:** 13.6% (UBER outperformed VOO by 13.6%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 70.5% (UBER's performance is in the 70.5th percentile relative to its historical performance against VOO, based on a range of -56.1% to 42.8%)

The provided data shows Uber significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the period in question.  However, the relative divergence metric highlights that while above average, this outperformance isn't exceptionally high considering its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | -5.0% | 63.6% | -0.0 | 87.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -34.0% | 68.7% | -0.0 | 51.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 13.0% | 70.5% | 0.1 | 128.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 43.0% | 72.6% | -0.1 | 126.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 57.0% | 72.6% | 0.8 | 152.8 |

The analysis shows high volatility (MDD) and a fluctuating beta, suggesting significant market sensitivity.  Alpha is generally positive in recent years, indicating potential outperformance, but inconsistent across the periods considered. The significant increase in market capitalization is also noteworthy.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $73.06
* **Previous Close:** $74.02
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $72.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $72.2855
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $72.9852

The price is slightly below the 5 and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a minor short-term downward trend, while it is above the 20-day average indicating some support.  The -1.3% change from the previous close reflects a recent small price drop.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4118 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.87 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.54 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -8.5% (Short-term negative expectation, possibly reflecting the recent price drop)
* **Long-term (2+ years) Expected Return vs S&P 500:**  Not directly calculable from the given data, but potentially positive considering the positive Alpha in the last 2 years.

The indicators present a mixed picture. While RSI suggests potential for a rebound, the negative expected return signals caution in the near term.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21     | 0.5          | +2.71      |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2      | 0.41         | +0.79      |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47     | 0.31         | +0.16      |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32    | 0.2203       | -0.54      |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66     | 0.17         | +0.49      |


UBER's recent EPS consistently exceeded expectations, except for the May 2024 quarter, suggesting positive earnings momentum.  The exceptionally high EPS in February 2025 needs further investigation for potential unusual circumstances.

|---------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $11.96B   | 39.51%        |             |

Revenue shows consistent growth.  Profit margins remain relatively stable, suggesting efficient operations.  Adding a Year-over-Year growth column would improve this analysis.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE         | Growth (YoY) |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.56B   | 31.93%      |             |
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78B   | 17.67%      |             |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.35B   | 8.22%       |             |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.06B   | -5.91%      |             |
| 2023-12-31 | $11.25B   | 12.70%      |             |

Equity has increased significantly, but ROE is highly volatile, indicating fluctuating profitability.  Adding a Year-over-Year growth column would improve this analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UBER demonstrates strong revenue growth and generally positive earnings surprises, suggesting a healthy underlying business. However, high volatility, as indicated by a fluctuating Beta and MDD, and inconsistent profitability (ROE) present significant risk.  While the recent outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is encouraging, a long-term investment decision requires careful consideration of the inherent risk.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the reasons behind the fluctuating ROE and the exceptionally high EPS in February 2025, is recommended before making any investment decisions. The short-term outlook is uncertain, but long-term potential seems relatively high if the company continues to grow revenue and improve efficiency.
