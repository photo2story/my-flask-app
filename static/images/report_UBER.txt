## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-hailing and delivery company.  The provided data shows a significant outperformance of UBER compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over a given period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **UBER Cumulative Return:** 39.69%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 18.61%
* **Return Difference:** 21.08% (UBER outperformed VOO by 21.08%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 74.6% (Indicates UBER's performance is in the upper 74.6th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO.)


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO). While recent periods show positive alpha (outperformance), earlier periods show negative alpha and high beta (high volatility correlated with the market).  The significant change in market capitalization (Cap(B)) also suggests considerable growth and potentially increased risk or opportunity.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | -5.0% | 63.6% | -0.0 | 88.8 |
| 2020-2022  | -34.0% | 68.7% | 0.1 | 52.4 |
| 2021-2023  | 13.0% | 70.5% | 0.0 | 130.4 |
| 2022-2024  | 43.0% | 72.6% | -0.1 | 127.8 |
| 2023-2025  | 55.0% | 81.0% | 0.8 | 139.0 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $65.64
* **Last Market Price:** $66.33 (+$1.05 increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $69.52
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $72.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $72.42

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase could be a temporary bounce.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.99 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)
* **PPO:** -1.34 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -6.5% (Negative expected return relative to current market conditions)

The relatively small price increase of $1.05 does not reflect a significant "jump" or "crash". The high MRI, negative PPO and low RSI suggest caution. The expected return is negative but this needs to be taken in context with the significantly higher than S&P 500 long-term return (2 years or more) which indicates potential long-term upside.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Uber has consistently exceeded earnings expectations recently, with EPS significantly above estimates in the last few quarters. This suggests positive momentum, but future performance is uncertain.


| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21     | 0.5          |

| 2024-08-06 | 0.47     | 0.31         |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32    | 0.2203       |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66     | 0.17         |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows steady growth, with strong and consistent profit margins. However, equity and ROE are more volatile, with some quarters showing negative ROE.  This could be due to factors like investments or write-offs. Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying drivers of this volatility.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $11.96B    | 39.51%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $11.19B    | 39.57%        |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

UBER has shown strong recent earnings growth and substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, this outperformance needs to be considered in the context of higher volatility (high Beta) and periods of significant underperformance. The current price is below key moving averages, RSI is approaching oversold levels and the PPO is negative suggesting a possible bearish sentiment.  The high MRI indicates high risk. While the recent earnings are positive, the long-term prospects require careful consideration of the company's ability to maintain its growth trajectory and manage its risk profile.  The long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is positive, but the high risk should be accounted for in any investment strategy.  Further analysis of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors is needed to make a well-informed investment decision.
