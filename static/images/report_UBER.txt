## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Stock Review

This report analyzes Uber Technologies Inc., a ride-hailing and food delivery company.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Uber's cumulative return (71.84%) slightly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (75.75%) by 3.9 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -3.9% places it at the 51.6th percentile of its historical range (-74.1% to 61.9%), indicating it's performing near the average relative to its past performance against the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows significant volatility in performance and risk across different periods:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                     |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2019-2021  | 8.0% | 11.0% | -62.0% | 0.2 | 87.6 | Relatively low beta, negative alpha          |
| 2020-2022  | -33.0% | 23.6% | -41.0% | 0.3 | 51.7 | Negative CAGR, high risk (MDD), negative alpha |
| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 23.6% | 1.0% | -0.9 | 128.6 | Positive CAGR, high risk (MDD), positive alpha |
| 2022-2024  | 56.0% | 23.6% | 23.0% | -1.0 | 126.0 | Strong CAGR, high risk (MDD), positive alpha |
| 2023-2025  | 84.0% | 55.6% | 38.0% | -0.6 | 158.4 | Very strong CAGR, high risk (MDD), positive alpha |

Uber's beta fluctuates significantly, suggesting its price movements are not consistently correlated with the overall market. The negative alpha in some periods indicates underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return.  However, recent periods show positive and strong alpha suggesting outperformance.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $75.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $73.50
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $70.72

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price increase of $2.0 (from $74.35) indicates a potential upward momentum.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.27 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.087 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -20.5% (This suggests a potential negative return in the short term. However the context of 'long-term (2+ years)' is needed for clarification).

The conflicting signals from the indicators warrant caution. While the price action is positive, the PPO suggests bearish momentum.  The significant price jump in the last day may be a temporary effect and should be monitored closely. The negative expected return needs further clarification regarding the timeframe and its calculation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Uber shows strong revenue growth and consistent profitability.  Earnings consistently beat expectations, which is a positive sign. However, the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 is mixed, and some technical indicators present conflicting signals. The high volatility and fluctuating beta suggest higher risk.  The negative expected return provided needs further context and clarification, especially concerning the long-term outlook of the investment.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the negative ROE in Q1 2024 is necessary.  Further analysis incorporating qualitative factors and a longer-term perspective is recommended before making any investment decisions.
