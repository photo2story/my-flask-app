**0. Summary Statistics:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global transportation network company connecting riders and drivers through a mobile app.  The following analysis summarizes Uber's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) using provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **Uber's Cumulative Return:** 97.97%
* **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 70.53%
* **Return Difference:** 27.4%
* **Relative Deviation:** 79.4% (This indicates Uber's performance is in the 79.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range.  It does *not* mean it outperformed the S&P 500 by 79.4%.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows highly variable performance year over year. While recent years show significant outperformance (75% and 105% CAGR), earlier periods reveal periods of significant underperformance and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The high Beta values (generally above 50) indicate Uber's high sensitivity to market movements.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 8.0% | 22.7% | -63.0% | 89.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -30.0% | 54.4% | -41.0% | 52.5 |
| 2021-2023  | 21.0% | 54.4% | 3.0% | 130.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 75.0% | 55.5% | 52.0% | 128.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 105.0% | 55.5% | 64.0% | 154.9 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Market Price:** $74.04 (a $1.05 increase from the previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $73.53
* **20-day Moving Average:** $73.55
* **60-day Moving Average:** $72.21

The recent price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a modestly positive short-term trend.  The price is also above the 60-day moving average, indicating a potentially stronger positive trend over a longer period.  The recent price increase of $1.05 signifies a small but noticeable upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.45 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.19 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Deviation Change:** -1.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -8.2% (Negative expected return relative to the market, though this is stated as a long-term (2+ years) estimate).

The mixed signals from the technical indicators warrant caution. While the RSI is not extreme, the negative PPO and declining relative deviation suggest bearish momentum.  The Last Market price increase might indicate a potential temporary reversal of this negative trend.

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21     | 0.5           | Significant Beat |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2      | 0.41          | Significant Beat |

| 2024-02-07 | 0.66     | 0.17          | Significant Beat |

Uber has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters except for one significant miss. The substantial beats, particularly in the latest quarters, are positive signs for the company's financial health.  This needs to be analyzed within the context of the overall market conditions and potential future expectations.

| 2024-09-30 | $14.78B     | 17.67%        | 31.1%              |

Equity and ROE show strong growth, however, Q1 2024 shows a significant decline in ROE. This needs further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Uber shows substantial growth in recent quarters, with strong revenue growth and consistent high-profit margins. Earnings have largely exceeded expectations. However, the stock's high volatility and sensitivity to market conditions (high Beta) present significant risk.  The -8.2% expected return suggests a potentially underwhelming long-term performance compared to the S&P 500, despite periods of significant outperformance.  The mixed technical indicators and highly variable historical performance warrant a cautious approach. Further investigation into the reasons for the Q1 2024 ROE decline is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Investors should consider their risk tolerance and diversification strategies before investing in UBER.
