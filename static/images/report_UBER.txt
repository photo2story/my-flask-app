## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-hailing company providing transportation services and food delivery.

The cumulative return of UBER is 75.79%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 87.19%.  Therefore, UBER underperformed VOO by **-11.4%** at the last data point.  The relative divergence of -11.4% places it at the 45.6th percentile of its historical range (max: 63.2%, min: -74.0%). This suggests that while underperforming the S&P 500 currently, the underperformance is not extreme compared to its historical volatility.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 10.0% | 60.7% | -54.0% | -0.1 | 145.0 |

| 2023-2025  | 103.0% | 29.5% | 36.0% | -0.1 | 145.0 |

The negative alpha consistently indicates UBER's underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The relatively low beta (-0.1) suggests low correlation with the overall market.  However, the significant changes in CAGR and MDD highlight the volatility of UBER's performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $69.14
* **Last Market Price:** $68.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $66.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $63.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.86

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish short-term trend.  The difference between the closing price and last market price is negligible.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 74.33 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.46 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -29.3% (This represents an expected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term).

The high RSI suggests potential short-term overvaluation.  However, the positive PPO and upward divergence are bullish indicators.  The negative expected return reinforces the long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The slight difference between the closing and last market prices doesn't indicate any significant sudden price changes.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2     | 0.41          | Significant Beat |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47    | 0.31          | Beat |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32   | 0.2203        | Significant Miss |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66    | 0.17          | Significant Beat |
| 2023-11-07 | 0.1     | 0.12          | Beat |

Uber has shown significant variability in EPS performance, consistently exceeding expectations in some quarters and significantly missing them in others. This volatility underscores the inherent risk associated with the investment.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78     | 17.67   |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.35     | 8.22    |

| 2023-09-30 | $9.36      | 2.36    |

Equity shows growth, although ROE fluctuates, indicating variability in profitability.  A negative ROE in Q1 2024 is a notable concern.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

UBER demonstrates significant growth potential, reflected in increasing revenue and generally high profit margins.  However, the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been underwhelming, with a negative alpha consistently showing underperformance against the market benchmark.  The high volatility of EPS and ROE highlights considerable risk.  While short-term indicators suggest a bullish trend, the long-term outlook (based on the provided expected return) is negative compared to the S&P 500.  Investors should carefully consider this volatility and the potential for long-term underperformance before investing.  Further research into the specific drivers of earnings variability and future growth projections is crucial for informed decision-making.  The high RSI also warns of potential short-term overvaluation.
