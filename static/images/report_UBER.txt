**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $68.30
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $67.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $64.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.05

The price is above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it's very close to its 60-day moving average, indicating potential consolidation or minor resistance at this level.  The recent price increase of $0.71 (from the previous close) is a notable positive change.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (75.7):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback.

* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -2.1% indicates a recent slight weakening of relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-36.7%):**  A negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant concern.  This heavily outweighs any short-term gains.

**7.  Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows strong revenue growth and healthy profit margins, and recently beat earnings expectations. However, its stock price performance significantly lags the S&P 500,  showing high volatility and negative alpha. The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term. The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 is a serious concern. While the company's fundamentals look positive, the significant underperformance relative to the market needs careful consideration before investment.  The high beta highlights the risk associated with investing in UBER.


**8.  Recommendation:**

Given the data presented, a cautious approach is recommended. While UBER's financial performance shows promise, its significant underperformance against the market benchmark and the negative long-term expected return raise substantial concerns.  Further research into the underlying reasons for this underperformance, as well as a comprehensive risk assessment, is crucial before making any investment decision.  The high volatility of the stock should also be carefully considered.
