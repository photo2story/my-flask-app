**4. Recent Earnings & Outlook:**

Uber's recent earnings show a mixed picture. While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., 2024-08-06 and 2024-10-31), others fell significantly short (e.g., 2024-05-08). The latest earnings (2024-10-31) reported EPS of $1.2, exceeding the estimated EPS of $0.41, showing positive surprise. However, consistent profitability is yet to be established.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

UBER's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 recently, but shows signs of potential recovery based on some recent earnings beats and an oversold RSI. However, the negative PPO, significant negative relative divergence, and low expected return suggest caution.  The company's financial statements show revenue growth, but profitability and ROE need further scrutiny.  Further investigation of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of UBERâ€™s investment potential. The current price suggests a bearish trend, but the oversold RSI may indicate a potential short-term bounce.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) requires careful monitoring of the company's performance, industry trends, and overall market conditions.
