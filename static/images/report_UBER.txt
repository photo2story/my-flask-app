**6) Overall Analysis:**

UBER has shown strong growth in recent periods, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this comes with high volatility, as indicated by its beta and MDD.  While recent earnings have been positive,  the relatively high RSI and negative short-term divergence suggest potential for a pullback.  The long-term outlook seems positive, given the consistent revenue growth and positive EPS surprises, but investors should be aware of the inherent risk associated with this high-growth, high-volatility stock.  Further due diligence and consideration of risk tolerance are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The -7.6% expected return suggests a wait-and-see approach may be beneficial in the short term, but a long-term strategy could be appropriate given the company's growth trajectory.
