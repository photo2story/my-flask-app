| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -5.0%   | 63.6% | -6.0%  | 0.3   | 86.3   |
| 2020-2022  | -34.0%  | 68.7% | -23.0% | 0.2   | 50.9   |
| 2021-2023  | 13.0%   | 70.5% | 3.0%   | 0.0   | 126.7  |
| 2022-2024  | 43.0%   | 72.6% | 13.0%  | -0.0  | 124.2  |
| 2023-2025  | 82.0%   | 72.6% | 37.0%  | -0.1  | 196.5  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows a significant positive trend in recent periods, increasing from -5% in 2019-2021 to 82% in 2023-2025. This indicates strong growth acceleration.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown remains consistently high, around 70%, indicating substantial risk or volatility in the stock's price movement over these periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha has turned positive in recent years, suggesting that UBER is generating returns above what would be expected based on its beta and market returns. This indicates good stock-picking or active management performance.
*   **Beta:** The beta values are close to zero or negative, implying that UBER's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). A negative beta suggests that the stock may move in the opposite direction of the market, which can be seen as a hedge during market downturns.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally increased over time, indicating growth in the company’s value.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 95.45
*   **Last Market Price:** 94.21 (Previous Close: 95.45, Change: -1.3)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 93.14
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 93.84
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 91.62

**Analysis:**

The price closed lower at 94.21 compared to the previous close of 95.45, indicating a slight downward movement. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day moving average, which in turn is slightly above the 60-day moving average. This suggests a potential short-term downward trend, but overall, prices are above the longer-term 60-day average.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 50.34
*   **PPO:** -0.19
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_69%_Sell 69.8% of holdings (980 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 69% on 2025-09-04)
*   **Recent (20-Day) Relative Divergence Change:** -8.3 (Negative - indicating a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -10.3% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) is in the "Low Risk" zone, suggesting a relatively stable market environment.
*   RSI is close to 50, indicating a neutral momentum.
*   The negative PPO suggests a slight downtrend in price momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal is advising to sell a portion of holdings and increase cash position to 69%.
*   The negative change in relative divergence and negative expected return warrant caution.

The fact that the last market price shows a change of -1.3 is not as dramatic as "급반등, 급하락" would imply, but still represents a negative movement that is in line with the recommendation to reduce exposure in the hybrid signal.

**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Assessment)**

Uber's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 recently, but there are some short-term caution signals. The analyst consensus is strongly positive, and the company has consistently beaten earnings estimates and demonstrated revenue growth. However, the hybrid signal advises reducing exposure, and the expected return is negative. The company's revenue and profit margins are stable and strong.

**Recommendations:**

*   Given the conflicting signals (positive analyst consensus vs. hybrid signal advising caution), a cautious approach may be warranted.
*   Investors may consider holding their existing positions, while potentially reducing exposure slightly as advised by the hybrid signal.
*   Monitor the company's performance closely, paying attention to revenue growth, profit margins, and any significant news or events that could impact its stock price.
*   Consider that the negative expected return is a long-term forecast relative to the S&P 500, and short-term gains could still be possible.

In summary, UBER shows a mix of strong fundamentals, positive analyst sentiment, and short-term cautionary signals.
