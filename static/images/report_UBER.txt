## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a transportation network company connecting riders and drivers through a mobile app.

The cumulative return of UBER (69.30%) lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (91.85%) by 22.5 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -22.5% places it in the 37.5th percentile of its historical range (max 63.2%, min -74%). This indicates UBER's underperformance relative to the broader market.  The Alpha consistently shows negative values (-0.1), indicating underperformance against the market benchmark (beta significantly larger than 1, showing high volatility).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $66.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $67.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $66.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $67.26

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend, but above its 20-day moving average, indicating some short-term support.  The recent price change (-$0.24) reflects a minor downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.79 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.21 (Slightly positive momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.9% (Indicates short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return:** -38.9% (This represents a significant projected underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming current trends continue.)  This negative expected return suggests potential risk involved in a long-term investment in UBER relative to a passive S&P 500 investment.

|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78     | 17.67%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.35     | 8.22%     |

| 2023-09-30 | $9.36      | 2.36%     |

Equity has increased, but ROE shows significant volatility, with negative ROE in Q1 2024. This indicates inconsistency in profitability relative to shareholder equity.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, but its stock performance significantly lags the S&P 500.  Earnings are volatile, and the projected long-term return is considerably negative compared to the market. While the recent earnings beats are positive, the inconsistent profitability and significant negative expected return should be carefully considered before investment. The high beta suggests significant volatility, adding further risk.  Further analysis of the drivers of the recent earnings beats and the factors affecting the long-term outlook are crucial before making any investment decisions.
