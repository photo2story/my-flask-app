## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a transportation network company providing ride-sharing and food delivery services.  As of the last data point, UBER's cumulative return (86.62%) lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (91.03%) by 4.41%.  The relative divergence of -4.41% places it at the 54.99th percentile of its historical range (max: 55.15%, min: -77.18%), indicating it's performed relatively well compared to its historical volatility against the S&P 500.


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500 across different periods. While Alpha generally indicates outperformance (positive values), the high Beta values suggest high sensitivity to market fluctuations.  This high Beta explains the significant swings in performance, as seen in the wide ranges of CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).


| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | 0.9%   | 62.0%  | -99.2%| 1.2   | 88.3   |
| 2020-2022  | -20.2%  | 62.0%  | -43.8%| 1.3   | 52.1   |
| 2021-2023  | 20.4%  | 52.9%  | -14.6%| 1.6   | 129.7  |

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $75.21

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -11.96 (-), indicating recent relative underperformance.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This needs further clarification.  A 0% expected return over 2+ years implies no outperformance of the S&P 500 is anticipated. This is inconsistent with the long-term growth perspective often associated with  tech stocks.)

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows a mixed performance picture. While revenue growth is positive, the stock's performance lags behind the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition but also bearish momentum. Recent earnings results are inconsistent, with some quarters exceeding expectations and others significantly falling short. The high Beta suggests substantial market sensitivity. Further investigation into the reasons behind the EPS shortfall and a review of recent news and analyst opinions are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The 0% expected return over two years against the S&P 500 is a significant concern that requires further evaluation.
