## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-sharing and delivery company.  This report analyzes Uber's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), examining its recent price movements, financial statements, and key performance indicators.  Uber shows strong recent growth but also high volatility.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Uber's cumulative return (62.37%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (37.39%) by 25 percentage points.  The provided relative divergence of 82% indicates that Uber's current outperformance is in the top 82nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, past performance is not indicative of future results.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | -5.0% | 63.6% | -0.0 | 87.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -34.0% | 68.7% | -0.0 | 51.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 13.0% | 70.5% | 0.1 | 128.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 43.0% | 72.6% | -0.1 | 126.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 77.0% | 72.6% | 0.8 | 176.2 |

**Analysis:**  The CAGR shows significant improvement over time, but  high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight substantial risk. Beta values fluctuate, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.  Positive alpha in the last period (2023-2025) suggests outperformance relative to the market during that period.  The increasing market capitalization shows growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $84.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $80.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $74.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $74.87

The closing price is significantly above the short-term (5-day) and longer-term (20-day, 60-day) moving averages, suggesting a recent price surge.  The price increase from the previous close (4.19) supports this.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 78.79 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.42 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +8.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -5.8% (This suggests a negative expected return, potentially due to the overbought RSI and recent surge in price)

The significant price increase ('change': 4.19) reflects a recent rapid upward movement which needs careful consideration. The negative expected return should be viewed in context with the high RSI. Long-term investment (2+ years) is suggested, but the -5.8% expected return against the S&P 500 indicates caution.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |

| 2024-02-07 | 0.66   | 0.17          |

**Analysis:**  Uber has significantly exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, particularly in the most recent reporting periods. This positive trend is a strong indicator of the company's improving financial health.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Uber demonstrates strong recent growth and profitability, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 in the recent period.  However, the high RSI, negative expected return, and historical volatility indicate potential risk.  The recent surge in price, while positive, warrants caution.  Long-term investors might consider Uber, but should be aware of the potential for price corrections given the overbought conditions and current market sentiment.  Further due diligence, including analysis of competitive landscape and future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
