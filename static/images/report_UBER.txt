## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a multinational ride-hailing company providing transportation services and food delivery.

As of the last data point, UBER's cumulative return (75.79%) lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (87.19%) by 11.4 percentage points.  This places its relative performance at the 45.6th percentile of its historical range (between -74.0% and 63.2% underperformance).  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over 2019-2025 was 76.0%, indicating strong growth despite the current underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  A negative alpha (-11.0%) suggests underperformance relative to the market, while a beta of -0.1 indicates a weak negative correlation with the market.  The market capitalization is $146 billion.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $69.14
* **Last Market Price:** $69.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $66.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $63.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.86

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing and last market price indicates minimal immediate volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 74.33 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 1.46 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +7.1% (Short-term upward trend)

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought, potentially indicating a short-term price correction. However, the positive PPO and upward relative divergence suggest continued positive momentum.  The expected return of -29.3% represents the projected underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This likely reflects the negative alpha observed. A price of $69.21 does not indicate any significant price jump or drop.

Equity has increased, but ROE fluctuates significantly, suggesting potential volatility in profitability.  The negative ROE in Q1 2024 is concerning.

**7. Overall Summary:**

UBER shows strong revenue growth and generally healthy profit margins.  However, inconsistent earnings and a negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns. The recent significant earnings beats are encouraging, but the negative alpha and fluctuating ROE indicate considerable risk. The stock's current price is above its moving averages, suggesting potential upward momentum, but the high RSI warrants caution against overbought conditions.  Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with UBER's volatility before investing.  A long-term investment strategy with a focus on consistent growth may be more suitable than short-term trading given the potential for large price swings.
