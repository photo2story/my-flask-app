No news or recent market outlook information is provided for analysis.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing from the provided data.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows mixed signals. While revenue and profit margins demonstrate consistent growth and profitability, the stock's performance significantly underperforms the S&P 500, with negative alpha consistently reported.  The recent earnings show volatility in EPS, and technical indicators suggest an oversold condition but a bearish momentum.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more comprehensive assessment.  The low expected return (0%) relative to the S&P 500 indicates limited potential for outperformance even with long-term investment.  Further investigation into recent news, analyst sentiment, and macroeconomic factors affecting the ride-sharing and food delivery sectors is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility (seen in Beta) is a significant risk factor.
