## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a transportation network company providing ride-sharing and food delivery services.

Over the observed period, UBER's cumulative return (74.31%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 52.12%.  The difference is 22.2 percentage points.  The relative outperformance places UBER in the 50.8th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500 (max: 92.3%, min: -50.2%).  This suggests strong relative performance, though past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR data further highlights this outperformance, with UBER showing increasing year-over-year growth, surpassing the implied growth of the S&P 500 (not explicitly stated, but inferred from the outperformance).  The Beta values of approximately 1.0 suggest that UBER's price movements correlate closely with the overall market.  However, Alpha values of approximately 1.0 indicate that UBER has generally outperformed the market, consistent with the cumulative return analysis. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows significant growth over the period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $68.56
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $67.95
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $65.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $67.90

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a consolidation phase may be underway. The recent price increase (0.38$) from the previous close shows a slight upward movement.  This is not a dramatic change and needs to be viewed within the context of broader market trends.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (70.84):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (0.95):** Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-2.8%):** Suggests a recent weakening of upward momentum, though not alarming.
* **Expected Return (-2.3%):**  This indicates a projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) horizon with continued investment.  This figure seems contradictory to the past performance shown and warrants further investigation into its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | 1.20     | 0.41         | +0.79       |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47     | 0.31         | +0.16       |

| 2023-11-07 | 0.10     | 0.12         | -0.02       |

Uber has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in most recent quarters, except for Q2 2024. This positive surprise could be contributing to the stock's outperformance. However, the significant variance in EPS and expected EPS highlights uncertainty and the need for further evaluation of the company's earnings stability.

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78      | 17.67%  |

| 2023-09-30 | $9.36       | 2.36%   |


Uber demonstrates strong and consistent revenue growth and relatively stable high profit margins.  However, ROE shows volatility, indicating potential challenges in consistent profitability management. The negative ROE in Q1 2024 is concerning and requires further investigation.

**7. Overall Summary:**

UBER has demonstrated strong recent performance, outperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  Positive earnings surprises and revenue growth are encouraging. However,  concerns remain regarding the volatility of ROE and the projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500.  The high RSI suggests caution, potential for short-term correction.  A thorough fundamental analysis, considering macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The discrepancy between past performance and projected future returns requires further clarification.  The -2.3% expected return should be carefully examined and verified given the strong historical results.
