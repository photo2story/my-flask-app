2025-12-25 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Uber (UBER) based on the provided data.

**0. Report Structure**

I'll present the data first, followed by analysis and interpretation.

**1. Return Rate Comparison (UBER vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Uber Technologies Inc. is a global mobility and delivery platform connecting drivers, riders, and eaters.
*   **UBER Cumulative Return:** 15.95%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 77.50%
*   **Divergence:** -61.55 (Range: Max 21.6, Min -64.2, Relative Divergence: 3.0)

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -18.0% | 78.6% | -61.0% | 0.0  | 89.5   |
| 2020-2022  | -40.0% | 78.6% | -39.0% | 0.1  | 52.8   |
| 2021-2023  | -3.0%  | 77.8% | -4.0%  | -0.1 | 131.4  |
| 2022-2024  | 34.0%  | 77.8% | 13.0%  | -0.1 | 128.7  |
| 2023-2025  | 36.0%  | 77.8% | -30.0% | -0.3 | 169.2  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** Uber has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. The large negative divergence highlights this.
*   **Low Relative Divergence:** A relative divergence of 3.0 suggests that the current divergence is near the lowest end of its historical range, meaning it has rarely been this far below the S&P 500.
*   **Negative CAGR:** The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is negative for the initial periods, indicating a loss in investment value. While it turns positive in later periods (2022-2025, 2023-2025), it's crucial to consider the context of the high MDD.
*   **High Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** The MDD is consistently high, indicating significant potential losses from peak to trough.
*   **Inconsistent Alpha:** Alpha, which measures the excess return compared to the benchmark, is inconsistent. It's negative in most periods, suggesting underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Low Beta:** Beta values are low, indicating that UBER's price is not strongly correlated with the S&P 500.  The negative beta in later periods suggests a slight inverse correlation.
*   **Cap(B):** The Cap(B) values fluctuate, reflecting changes in the company's market capitalization.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 79.31
*   **Last Market:** Price: 81.15, Previous Close: 80.97, Change: 0.22
*   **5-day SMA:** 80.18
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.66
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.48

**Analysis:**

*   **Price Below Moving Averages:** The current price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a potential downtrend.
*   **Short-Term Decline:** The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, confirming a short-term downward trend.
*   **Slight Increase in last Market Close:** The 'Last Market' data shows a slight increase from the previous close, but it's not enough to reverse the overall downtrend indicated by the moving averages.

**3. Market Risk Indicator, RSI, PPO, Hybrid Signal, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 30.25
*   **PPO:** -0.96
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -10.2 (단기하락 = Short-term Decline)
*   **Last Market Price:** {'price': 81.15, 'previousClose': 80.97, 'change': 0.22}
*   **Expected Return (%):** -537.6

**Analysis:**

*   **Neutral MRI:** An MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, signaling moderate risk in the overall market environment.
*   **Oversold RSI:** An RSI of 30.25 indicates that the stock is approaching oversold territory, which could suggest a potential buying opportunity.
*   **Negative PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.96) indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, suggesting a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying 90% of cash with a safe approach.
*   **Short-Term Decline:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days (-10.2) confirms a recent short-term decline.
*   **Marginal Market price change:** The 'Last Market' data shows a slight increase from the previous close, but it's not enough to reverse the overall downtrend.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The Expected Return of -537.6% is extremely negative and warrants significant scrutiny. This projection suggests a very high risk of substantial losses if investing long-term.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Based on the provided data, here's a summary:

*   **Underperformance:** Uber has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.
*   **Downtrend:** Recent stock price fluctuations and technical indicators (RSI, PPO) point to a downtrend.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The dramatically negative expected return is a major red flag. This indicates the potential for substantial losses if invested in the long term.
*   **Mixed News:** Recent news is a mixed bag. The robotaxi partnership is positive, but concerns about FTC lawsuits and competition with Lyft remain.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Despite the challenges, analysts are generally optimistic about Uber's future. The consensus is "Buy," and the target price suggests significant upside.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Investing in Uber at this time appears highly speculative. While analysts are bullish and there are some positive developments (robotaxi partnership), the technical indicators point to a downtrend, the historical performance is poor compared to the S&P 500, and the expected return is drastically negative. The high MDD and inconsistent Alpha also highlight the risks.

Therefore, a cautious approach is warranted. While the oversold RSI *might* present a short-term buying opportunity, the long-term outlook is uncertain. The drastically negative expected return cannot be ignored. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in UBER. Any investment decision should be made considering personal risk tolerance and investment goals. The news highlights both positive developments and potential risks, underscoring the need for informed decision-making.
