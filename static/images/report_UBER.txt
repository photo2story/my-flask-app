2025-12-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down this Uber stock analysis.

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** Uber Technologies Inc. is a global technology company providing ride-hailing, food delivery, and freight transportation services.
*   **Return Rate Comparison:**
    *   Uber Cumulative Return: 15.95%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 77.50%
    *   Divergence: -61.6 (Relative Divergence: 3.0)

    *   **Analysis:** Uber has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined.  The large negative divergence of -61.6 highlights this considerable gap in returns. The relative divergence of 3.0 indicates that the current difference in return is near the lowest point in the recent range of divergence.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis Table:**

    | Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
    |------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
    | 2019-2021  | -18.0%  | 78.6% | -61.0% | 0.0   | 89.3   |
    | 2020-2022  | -40.0%  | 78.6% | -39.0% | 0.1   | 52.6   |

    | 2023-2025  | 36.0%   | 77.8% | -30.0% | -0.3  | 168.9  |

    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows inconsistent performance. Some periods show significant negative growth, while recent periods (2022-2025) display positive growth.
        *   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
        *   **Alpha:** The Alpha is mostly negative, suggesting underperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). A positive Alpha (2022-2024) is a good sign, indicating outperformance during that period.
        *   **Beta:** The Beta is generally low (close to 0), suggesting Uber's price movements have a low correlation with the overall market.  A negative Beta suggests a slightly inverse relationship (though the numbers are very small).
        *   **Cap(B):** It shows that the Market Cap is fluctuating every year.

*   5-day SMA: 80.18
*   20-day SMA: 85.66
*   60-day SMA: 91.48

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a short-term downtrend. The price dropping below the 5-day SMA suggests recent selling pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence Change, and Expected Return:**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 30.25
*   PPO: -0.96
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -10.2 (Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return (%): -537.6%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A moderate score of 0.8 suggests a medium level of risk associated with the stock.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 30.25 indicates that Uber might be approaching oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** The negative PPO (-0.96) suggests a downtrend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** suggests buying 90% of your cash is viable, but with only 1 share. 0% cash available on December 3, 2025.
    *   **Divergence Change:** A recent negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term decline in performance.
    *   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return suggests a high degree of caution. This figure likely indicates a projection of continued underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a longer investment horizon.

    *   Partnership with Baidu to test robotaxis in London (Yahoo Finance, Investor's Business Daily).

    *   Target Price: Avg: 111.84 / High: 150.00 / Low: 78.00

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is strongly positive, with a "Buy" rating and a significant average target price significantly higher than the current price.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Uber's current situation presents a mixed picture.

**Negative Signals:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:**  Uber has vastly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **High Volatility:** High MDD values across the analysed periods indicate significant volatility.
*   **Recent Downtrend:** The stock price is below its moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The projected long-term underperformance (negative expected return) is a major concern.

**Positive Signals:**

*   **Analyst Optimism:**  The strong analyst consensus with "Buy" ratings and high price targets is a significant positive.
*   **Robotaxi Momentum:**  The partnership with Baidu for robotaxi trials suggests potential for future growth and innovation.
*   **Possible Oversold Condition:** The RSI is approaching oversold levels, which could indicate a potential bounce.
*   **Medium Risk:** The Market Risk Indicator implies a medium degree of risk.

**Summary:**

Overall, Uber is currently a risky investment. Despite the recent positive news regarding the robotaxi partnership and positive analyst ratings, the stock's underperformance, high volatility, recent downtrend, and negative expected return suggest caution. The negative relative divergence change reinforces the short-term bearish sentiment.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, a **Hold/Neutral** rating is appropriate. While the analyst consensus is positive and the robotaxi development is encouraging, the fundamental underperformance and negative technical indicators outweigh these factors. A potential investor should wait for clearer signs of a turnaround, such as sustained price movement above the moving averages and improved financial performance, before considering a long position. Investors should also closely monitor the FTC lawsuit mentioned in the news.
