**7. Overall Analysis:**

Uber shows strong revenue growth and healthy profit margins. However, its stock performance lags behind the S&P 500, exhibiting negative alpha consistently.  While recent earnings have exceeded expectations,  the volatility in EPS and ROE raises concerns regarding the sustainability of its growth and profitability. The projected long-term underperformance (-36%) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant negative.  Further investigation is needed to understand the basis for this projection and to analyze the risk factors associated with UBER investment.  The high beta values suggest significant market sensitivity, which adds to the risk profile.  Investors should carefully consider these factors before making an investment decision.
