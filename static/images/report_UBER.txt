**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 10.0% | 60.7% | -54.0% | -0.1 | 144.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -19.0% | 60.7% | -27.0% | -0.1 | 144.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 24.0% | 48.8% | 0.0% | -0.1 | 144.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 39.0% | 45.7% | 18.0% | -0.1 | 144.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 101.0% | 29.5% | 27.0% | -0.1 | 144.0 |

The consistently negative alpha suggests UBER has historically underperformed the market, even considering its beta, which is close to 0, indicating low correlation with the overall market. The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values highlight significant risk.  However, recent years show improving CAGR.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $68.30
* **Last Market Price:** $68.50
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $67.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $64.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.05

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum, but still below the long-term trend. The significant difference between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages illustrates recent volatility.  The small positive change from the previous close ($0.30) is not a significant indicator.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.71  (Suggests the stock is in overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.03 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.1% (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term, 2+ years):** -36.7% (relative to S&P 500)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be due for a correction.  Despite a positive PPO, the negative relative divergence and the significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns about long-term performance.

| Date       | EPS       | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |

**7. Overall Summary:**

UBER shows strong revenue growth and healthy profit margins. However, its stock performance lags behind the S&P 500, and its historical alpha is negative. While recent earnings have been positive, significant volatility in both earnings and ROE raises concerns. The high RSI and negative long-term expected return suggest caution is warranted, particularly concerning long-term investments. Further in-depth analysis of the company's competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and risk factors is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant consideration.
