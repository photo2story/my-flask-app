Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) is a transportation network company providing ride-hailing services and food delivery.  Over the analyzed period, UBER's cumulative return (76.64%) lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) return (91.95%) by 15.31%.  This represents a relative divergence of 46.75% based on the historical range of divergence between the two assets (max: 55.15%, min: -77.18%).  The provided alpha and beta values suggest that UBER's performance exhibits high volatility (high beta) and has, at times, outperformed the market (positive alpha). However, the negative CAGR for 2020-2022 highlights periods of underperformance.

* **Closing Price:** $69.33 (Last Market: $69.35)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.31

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (24.16):**  Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term bounce. However, this alone doesn't confirm a bullish trend reversal.
* **PPO (-0.69):** Negative value points to a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-22.98):** Shows a recent period of significant underperformance relative to the market.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided expectation of 0% indicates no significant S&P 500 outperformance is projected over the long term (2+ years) at the current valuation.  This needs to be further investigated as a 0% expected return is not necessarily representative of the actual expected long-term return.  Additional forecasting models would need to be considered.

The current price ($69.35) being slightly above the closing price ($69.33) doesn’t indicate a significant sudden upward or downward movement; the differences are very slight and within the expected trading range.
