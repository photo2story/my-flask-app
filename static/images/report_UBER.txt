**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER), a ride-hailing and food delivery company, based on provided financial and market data.  We will assess its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) and provide insights into its current valuation and future prospects.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **UBER Cumulative Return:** 100.72%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 92.61%
* **Return Difference:** 8.11%  (UBER outperformed VOO by 8.11% at the last data point)

The table below shows the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and market capitalization (Cap) of UBER over various periods.  Note that negative Alpha values indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 2.0% | 11.0% | -68.0% | 88.3 |
| 2020-2022  | -35.0% | 23.9% | -43.0% | 52.1 |

| 2023-2025  | 112.0% | 15.5% | 50.0% | -1.1 | 167.2 |


Uber's performance has been volatile, showing periods of significant losses and substantial gains. The high beta values indicate a higher sensitivity to market movements than the overall market. The consistently negative alpha across various periods suggests it historically underperformed compared to the S&P 500, though recently this has reversed.


**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $79.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $78.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.88

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.37 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought but approaching it)
* **PPO:** 1.70 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.4% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -16.8% (This suggests potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite the recent positive performance.  This should be interpreted cautiously as projections are highly uncertain.)

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21    | 0.5           | +2.71       |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2     | 0.41          | +0.79       |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47    | 0.31          | +0.16       |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32   | 0.2203        | -0.54       |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66    | 0.17          | +0.49       |

Uber has consistently exceeded EPS expectations recently, showing strong earnings growth. However, past performance does not guarantee future results.


**5) Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided.  This is a significant limitation to a comprehensive analysis.  These key figures are crucial for understanding UBER's financial health and growth potential.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Uber shows a mixed picture.  While recent performance has outpaced the S&P 500,  historical data reveals significant volatility and underperformance relative to the market (indicated by negative alpha values). Positive technical indicators and consistently exceeding earnings expectations suggest a potentially positive short-term outlook. However, the lack of crucial financial data and the projected long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 raise concerns about sustained growth.  Further analysis, including revenue and profit data, is necessary for a more complete and accurate evaluation. The long-term investment recommendation of -16.8% should be considered highly speculative, due to the lack of complete financial data and inherent uncertainties in market prediction.
