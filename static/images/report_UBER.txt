## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a transportation network company providing ride-hailing services and food delivery.

As of the last recorded date, UBER's cumulative return is 68.59%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 88.39%.  This results in a difference of -19.8%.  Considering the provided historical range of divergence (max: 63.2%, min: -74.0%), UBER's current performance sits at the 39.5th percentile relative to the S&P 500.  The provided Alpha consistently shows a negative value (-0.1), indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  Beta values fluctuate but are generally high, suggesting high volatility and correlation to the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $66.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $63.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $62.21
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $70.69

The price is currently above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downtrend or consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 77.69  (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.33 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.5% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -37.9%

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction.  The positive PPO supports the short-term upward momentum, but the significantly negative expected return over the long term compared to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  The current price of $66.31 does not reflect a significant recent price jump (no mention of a sharp rise or fall is available from the data).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent EPS performance. While the company exceeded EPS expectations in the last two quarters (Oct 2024 and August 2024), it significantly missed expectations in May and February of 2024.  The November 2023 quarter showed a slight beat.  There is a clear trend of increasing EPS, although volatility exists.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent growth quarter-over-quarter, indicating a healthy growth trajectory. Profit margins remain relatively stable around 39%, demonstrating consistent profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has increased significantly over the past year, but the ROE fluctuates considerably, indicating variability in profitability.  Negative ROE in Q1 2024 is a significant concern.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:**  The provided data includes recent earnings reports (see section 4).  However, additional news and market outlook information are required to provide a complete analysis.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Uber shows strong revenue growth and relatively stable profit margins. However, EPS performance has been erratic, and the long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 is significantly negative.  The stock currently shows short-term upward momentum, but the high RSI suggests an overbought condition.  The significant negative long-term expected return and variable ROE present considerable risk. More information on recent market news and analyst opinions is necessary for a complete assessment.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is recommended. While revenue growth is positive, the inconsistent EPS, negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500,  and potentially overbought technical indicators suggest further analysis is needed before making any investment decisions.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a more definitive conclusion.  Investors should carefully weigh the risks before investing in UBER.  Further research into the company's future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and any potential catalysts for future growth are crucial.
