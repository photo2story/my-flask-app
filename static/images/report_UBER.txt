## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Deviation:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a provider of transportation services and food delivery.  The cumulative return of UBER is 86.62%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) achieved 91.03%.  Therefore, UBER underperformed VOO by 4.41 percentage points.  The relative deviation, considering the historical range, sits at 54.99%, indicating it's relatively close to the average underperformance compared to its historical volatility against the S&P 500.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (S&P 500). While the most recent period (2022-2024) shows strong positive alpha (outperformance), previous periods exhibit negative or low returns and high betas (high market sensitivity).  The significant drawdowns (MDD) highlight the volatility inherent in UBER's stock.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $71.77
* **20-day Moving Average:** $75.21
* **60-day Moving Average:** $74.91

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The 5-day average being significantly lower than the others indicates recent downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.72 - This suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce is possible, but not guaranteed.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.58 - A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Deviation Change:** -11.96% - Indicates a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided expected return is 0%, meaning no significant outperformance is anticipated over the S&P 500 in the long term (2+ years).  This needs further analysis based on future projections and risk tolerance.
* **73.26 vs Closing Price:**  The slight difference between the last market price (73.26) and the closing price (73.25) is negligible and doesn't suggest a significant sudden price movement (no indication of a rapid surge or plunge).


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The earnings per share (EPS) show inconsistency. While the most recent quarter (Oct 31, 2024) showed a significant positive EPS of 1.2 (significantly exceeding expectations of 0.41), previous quarters have exhibited both positive and negative EPS, often falling short of expectations.  This highlights the volatility and uncertainty surrounding Uber's profitability.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue consistently increased over the given period, demonstrating growth. Profit margins remain relatively stable around 39%, indicating consistent profitability.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been increasing, but the Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates significantly, ranging from a loss to over 17%. This inconsistency highlights the challenges in consistently generating returns on invested capital.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

UBER shows signs of growth in revenue and profitability, but inconsistent EPS and fluctuating ROE indicate volatility and challenges in consistent performance.  The stock's price is currently below its moving averages, suggesting short-term bearish momentum.  Technical indicators like the RSI and PPO also suggest the stock might be oversold, but this does not guarantee a price rebound. The long-term outlook depends heavily on Uber's ability to maintain revenue growth, improve profitability consistency and manage its operational expenses effectively. The lack of outperformance against the S&P 500 in the provided projection suggests investors should carefully consider its risk profile before investing.


**8.  Report in English (Summary):**

This report analyzes Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) stock performance. While UBER has demonstrated revenue growth and generally stable profit margins, its EPS and ROE exhibit considerable volatility, reflecting operational challenges.  Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, although oversold conditions (as indicated by RSI) might signal a potential short-term bounce.  However, the long-term projection shows no significant outperformance against the S&P 500, indicating the need for careful risk assessment before investment.  Further analysis of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial to fully assess the investment potential.  The provided data suggests that UBER is a volatile stock with growth potential, but also significant risk.
