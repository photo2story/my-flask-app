**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Uber's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.

* **UBER Cumulative Return:** 99.13%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.54%

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different periods.  While recent periods show high CAGR and a positive alpha relative to the S&P 500, earlier periods demonstrate negative alpha and high beta, indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The significant swings in Beta suggest substantial changes in the company's risk profile over time, likely reflecting changing market conditions and investor sentiment.  Further analysis is required to explain this variance fully.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Uber has shown significant improvement in EPS compared to expectations, particularly in recent quarters.  However, the large discrepancy between actual and expected EPS in earlier quarters warrants further investigation into the causes of these substantial misses in prior forecasts.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21 | 0.5 |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2 | 0.41 |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47 | 0.31 |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32 | 0.2203 |

**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows consistent growth, while profit margins remain relatively stable and high.  Equity and ROE exhibit volatility.  The negative ROE in Q1 2024 is a notable concern and requires further investigation. The significant increase in equity between Q3 2024 and Q4 2024 also warrants further analysis to understand the underlying factors contributing to this change.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Uber has shown strong recent earnings growth, exceeding expectations significantly. Revenue growth is consistent, and profit margins are healthy. However, the stock price is currently trading below its moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downtrend. The recent significant price drop warrants further investigation into underlying market factors.  While historical performance has outpaced the S&P 500, the volatility in alpha and beta, and the negative ROE in Q1 2024, highlight the risk associated with investing in UBER.  A comprehensive analysis including qualitative factors (competitive landscape, regulatory changes, etc.) and a deeper dive into the financial statements is necessary for a complete investment decision.  The provided data alone does not provide sufficient information to definitively recommend a long or short position.
