## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-sharing and food delivery company.

As of the last data point, UBER's cumulative return (82.19%) lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (94.75%) by 12.56 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -12.56% places it at the 48.83rd percentile of historical divergence based on the provided minimum (-77.18%) and maximum (55.15%) values. This suggests that while underperforming the S&P 500, the current underperformance isn't exceptionally extreme compared to its historical volatility relative to the index.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta).  While the most recent period (2022-2024) demonstrates strong outperformance (62.7% CAGR), previous periods show significant underperformance and high volatility (MDD).  The high Beta values indicate substantial market sensitivity.  The positive Alpha values in some periods suggest that UBER may have generated returns above what would be expected given its beta and the market's performance.  However, this is inconsistent across the analyzed periods.


| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | 0.9%   | 62.0%  | -99.2% | 1.2   | 88.3   |

The closing price of $71.51 does not indicate a significant recent surge or crash based on the provided moving averages.  The expected return of 0.0% suggests that, over the long term (2+ years) and assuming consistent contributions, the projected excess return over the S&P 500 is negligible at this time.
