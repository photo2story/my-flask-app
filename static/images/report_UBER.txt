**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, preventing a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is a significant limitation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

UBER has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, showing a strong cumulative return. However, several indicators raise concerns. The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, increasing the risk of a price correction. The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 and the lack of crucial financial data (revenue, gross profit) further temper enthusiasm.  While recent earnings have been positive surprises, the sustainability of this trend needs further investigation.  A more complete financial analysis is needed before making any investment decision.  The strong short-term momentum should be considered alongside the potential for a correction given the overbought conditions and the lack of longer-term positive projections compared to the market.
