**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  UBER's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has fluctuated significantly.  While recent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025) show positive CAGR, earlier periods show substantial losses.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, around 78%, indicating significant potential for losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, which measures performance relative to the market, is generally negative, indicating UBER has underperformed the market on a risk-adjusted basis in several periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to zero or slightly negative, suggesting UBER's price is not highly correlated with the overall market and, more recently, has moved in the opposite direction of the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Increased Market Cap indicates growth in the size of the company.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 79.31

*   **5-day SMA:** 80.18
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.66
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.48

**Analysis:** UBER's stock price is currently trending downward, as the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA.  The slight negative change in the most recent trading day doesn't suggest a dramatic immediate shift, but reinforces the short-term downward trend.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 30.25
*   **PPO:** -0.96

*   **Expected Return (%):** -214.8 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A MRI of 0.7 suggests a moderate level of risk associated with investing in UBER.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 30.25 indicates that UBER is nearing oversold territory, potentially suggesting a possible rebound in the short term.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests that UBER is in a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is recommending buying 90% of available cash using 1 share of the stock and with 0% cash ratio.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms a short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return suggests poor performance compared to S&P 500 (VOO) if invested long-term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Robotaxis & Competition:** Concerns about robotaxis potentially disrupting Uber's business model.
*   **Stock Slide:**  The stock is experiencing weakness.
*   **FTC Lawsuit:** An expanding FTC lawsuit is impacting the stock.
*   **Analyst Upgrade:**  One article suggests UBER is a long-term compounder at a bargain price (Seeking Alpha - rating upgrade).
*   **Autonomous Delivery:** Comparison with other autonomous delivery stocks (SERV).
*   **UAE Expansion:**  Discussion about the impact of AV expansion in the UAE.

**Analysis:** Recent news paints a mixed picture. While the Seeking Alpha article highlights a potential long-term opportunity with a rating upgrade, the headlines about the stock slide, FTC lawsuit, and robotaxi competition raise concerns. Expansion into new markets like the UAE is a positive sign.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell):** 1.54 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 50
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 111.96 / 150.00 / 84.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  (No specific changes provided)

**Analysis:**  Despite the recent negative performance, analyst consensus remains positive with a "Buy" rating and a significant average target price well above the current price. This suggests analysts believe the stock has the potential for significant upside.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

UBER's stock is currently facing challenges. It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibits high volatility (high MDD), and is currently in a short-term downward trend (negative SMAs, RSI nearing oversold). The Market Risk Indicator suggests moderate risk.

However, analyst consensus remains positive, and recent news includes a rating upgrade suggesting long-term potential. Expansion into new markets and the potential for autonomous vehicle technology offer opportunities, but competition and regulatory headwinds remain a concern.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The data suggests a mixed outlook for UBER. While short-term indicators point to a potential rebound after a recent slide, significant challenges remain. The company needs to address concerns about profitability, competition, and regulatory issues to justify its current valuation and analyst target prices. An investment in UBER at this point would be considered moderately risky, relying on the company's ability to execute its long-term growth strategy and overcome its current headwinds.
