**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | -5.0% | 63.6% | -0.0 | 88.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -34.0% | 68.7% | -0.0 | 52.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 13.0% | 70.5% | 0.1 | 129.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 43.0% | 72.6% | -0.1 | 126.9 |
| 2023-2025  | 74.0% | 72.6% | 0.8 | 173.2 |

Analysis: Uber's CAGR has shown significant improvement over time, reaching 74% in the most recent period.  High maximum drawdown (MDD) values suggest volatility.  Beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements. Alpha is generally low except for the 2023-2025 period, suggesting periods of outperformance relative to the market.  Market capitalization has steadily increased.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.30
* **Last Market Price:** $82.81
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $84.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $77.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.48

Analysis: The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. However, it's above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term uptrend. The last market price shows a slight increase compared to the previous close, indicating recent buying pressure.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 66.78 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.85 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -6.3% (This implies potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, based on the model used).  Given the recent positive price change ($0.62 increase), this might be subject to revision.  The slight upward movement could suggest a temporary market correction from the -6.3% expectation.

Analysis:  While the PPO and short-term divergence suggest positive momentum, the RSI is nearing overbought levels, indicating potential for a price correction. The negative expected return should be considered carefully,  and further analysis of underlying factors driving this prediction is needed.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS       | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 2025-05-07 | $0.83     | $0.508       | Beat       |

Analysis: Uber has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, except for Q2 2024.  The significant beats, especially in Q1 and Q4 2025, suggest strong underlying performance.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $11.53B     | 39.85%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $11.96B     | 39.51%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $11.19B     | 39.57%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $10.70B     | 39.36%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $10.13B     | 39.12%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity       | ROE           |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $21.98B     | 8.08%         |
| 2024-12-31 | $21.56B     | 31.93%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78B     | 17.67%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.35B     | 8.22%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.06B     | -5.91%        |

Analysis: Revenue shows consistent growth, though the rate of growth appears to be slowing slightly. Profit margins are relatively stable and high.  Equity has increased, but ROE fluctuates significantly, possibly due to changes in capital structure or accounting methods. The highly variable ROE requires further investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

UBER has shown strong recent performance, outperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  Earnings have generally exceeded expectations, suggesting a healthy underlying business.  However, several factors warrant caution:  the high MDD indicates volatility, the RSI suggests potential overbought conditions, and the projected long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500.  Furthermore, the fluctuating ROE and Beta suggest that UBER's performance is not consistent and is highly dependent on market conditions.  Further due diligence is needed before making any investment decisions, including a thorough review of the methodology behind the -6.3% expected return and the reasons for the fluctuating ROE.  The recent earnings beats are positive, but sustainability should be considered.
