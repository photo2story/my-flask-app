    *Analysis:*
    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR fluctuates significantly, indicating volatile performance. Recent years (2022-2025) show positive growth, but historical periods show significant losses.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values consistently indicate substantial risk, with potential losses exceeding 77%.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally negative, except for the 2022-2024 period, suggesting Uber typically underperforms its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values are close to zero or slightly negative, suggesting Uber's price is relatively uncorrelated with the market (S&P 500). A beta near zero suggests that the stock's returns are not highly sensitive to overall market movements, potentially due to company-specific factors dominating its performance.
    *   **Cap(B):** The market cap has increased, showing positive signs in recent years.

    *   The RSI is nearing oversold levels, potentially indicating a possible bounce.
    *   The negative PPO confirms a downtrend.
    *   The 20-day relative divergence decreasing indicates a recent short-term decline relative to the S&P 500.

    *Analysis:*  Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating on the stock and see significant upside potential based on the average target price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices suggests considerable uncertainty.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:**  Uber has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a current divergence of -61.55%. Its historical performance is volatile, with high maximum drawdowns and generally negative alpha values. The stock is currently in a downtrend, trading below its key moving averages. Technical indicators like the RSI suggest it might be approaching oversold conditions. The expected return is extremely negative, which should give strong pause to anyone considering investing.

*   **News & Analyst Sentiment:** The news highlights the potential future impact of autonomous vehicles, which presents both opportunities and threats for Uber. While analysts have a generally positive outlook with a "Buy" consensus and a substantial target price above the current price, there is a high degree of uncertainty reflected in the wide range of price targets.

*   **Conclusion:**  While the analyst consensus and some news headlines offer a positive outlook, the data presents a mixed to bearish picture. The substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, recent downtrend, and extremely negative expected return are concerning. The potential impact of autonomous vehicles introduces further uncertainty.

*   **Recommendation:**  Given the conflicting signals, caution is advised. While the analyst consensus is positive, potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence, carefully consider their risk tolerance, and closely monitor developments in the autonomous vehicle space. This is likely a higher-risk investment compared to a broad market index fund like VOO.
