## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Analysis

This report analyzes Uber Technologies Inc., a ride-hailing and food delivery company, based on the provided data.


**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Uber's cumulative return (43.51%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (25.86%) by 17.65 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 71.1% indicates that Uber's performance is in the upper 71.1 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  While this suggests strong relative performance, it's crucial to consider the risk involved, as indicated by the historical range of divergence (max: 46.6%, min: -53.7%).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                      |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2019-2021  | -5.0% | 63.6% | -37.0% | -0.0 | 87.7 | Negative CAGR, high MDD                     |
| 2020-2022  | -34.0% | 68.7% | -36.0% | 0.1 | 51.7 | Significant negative CAGR, high MDD         |
| 2021-2023  | 13.0% | 70.5% | 3.0% | 0.0 | 128.8 | Positive CAGR, but still high MDD          |
| 2022-2024  | 43.0% | 72.6% | 29.0% | -0.1 | 126.1 | Strong positive CAGR, high MDD               |
| 2023-2025  | 58.0% | 72.6% | 48.0% | 0.7 | 154.8 | Very strong positive CAGR, high MDD         |

The Alpha and Beta values fluctuate significantly year over year, highlighting volatility and inconsistent relationship to the market.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) across all periods suggests considerable risk.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $74.02
* **5-day Moving Average:** $72.60
* **20-day Moving Average:** $72.28
* **60-day Moving Average:** $72.90

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the averages indicates limited momentum.  The recent price increase of $1.26 (from $73.1 to $74.02) shows a recent positive move.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 49.72 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.46 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -6.9% (Negative expected return compared to S&P 500 for a long-term investment, which should be taken in context with the fact that UBER had outperformed the S&P 500)

The conflicting signals (positive PPO but negative relative divergence and expected return) warrant further investigation.  The recent price increase might reflect short-term factors rather than a sustained trend.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|---------------|------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21    | 0.5           | 2.71       |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2     | 0.41          | 0.79       |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47    | 0.31          | 0.16       |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32   | 0.2203        | -0.5403     |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66    | 0.17          | 0.49       |

Uber consistently exceeded expected EPS in recent quarters, except for Q2 2024. This positive trend suggests improving profitability, though volatility remains.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows steady growth, and profit margins remain consistently high around 39%.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has fluctuated, and ROE shows volatility, ranging from a negative value to over 30%. This highlights the risk associated with Uber's investment.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Uber has shown strong relative performance against the S&P 500, particularly in the most recent period, but this comes with high volatility and risk. While recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations, historical data indicates significant downside risk. The conflicting signals from technical indicators require careful consideration.  Long-term investors should weigh the potential for high returns against the substantial risk, particularly the high MDD.  The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 suggests that although it has outperformed in the recent past, the long-term outlook might be less optimistic.  Further research into the underlying drivers of growth and risk is essential before making investment decisions.
