2025-12-21 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the UBER stock data you provided, along with analysis.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (UBER vs. VOO)**

*   **Uber Technologies Inc Overview:** A global technology company offering ride-hailing, food delivery, and freight transportation services.
*   **UBER Cumulative Return:** 15.95%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 77.50%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -58.1
    *   Relative Divergence: 7.1
    *   Max: 21.6, Min: -64.2

**Analysis:**

*   UBER has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period represented by the cumulative returns.
*   The divergence of -58.1 indicates a large gap in performance, with VOO far outpacing UBER.
*   The relative divergence of 7.1 suggests that the current underperformance is near the lowest point (bottom 7.1 percentile) of the historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This doesn't necessarily mean it *will* improve, but it indicates it's already at a low point *relative* to its past underperformance.

**Alpha, Beta, and Other Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -18.0% | 78.6% | -61.0% | 0.0   | 87.4  |
| 2020-2022  | -40.0% | 78.6% | -39.0% | 0.1   | 51.6  |

| 2022-2024  | 34.0%  | 77.8% | 13.0%  | -0.1  | 125.8 |
| 2023-2025  | 36.0%  | 77.8% | -30.0% | -0.3  | 165.4 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows fluctuating annual performance. Negative values in the earlier periods highlight significant underperformance.  While the last two periods are positive, they still need to be considered in the context of previous losses.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The high MDD values (around 78%) across all periods indicate significant volatility and risk in UBER's stock price.  This means that at some point during each period, the stock price dropped by approximately 78% from its peak.
*   **Alpha:**  Measures the stock's performance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500), adjusted for risk (Beta). Negative Alpha values indicate underperformance compared to the benchmark. The alpha fluctuates and is lately in negative territory (2023-2025)
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market (S&P 500). A Beta near 0 indicates very low correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in Billions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 79.31
*   **Previous Close:** 79.69
*   **Change:** -0.48
*   **5-day SMA:** 80.18
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.66
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.48

**Analysis:**

*   UBER's price closed lower than its previous close, continuing a recent downward trend.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This confirms a downward trend in the stock price. The stock price is below all of its moving averages, further indicating bearish momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 30.25 (approaching oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.96 (negative momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -12.4 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -214.8% (long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI of 30.25 suggests that the stock is nearing oversold territory, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity for some investors *if* they believe the stock will rebound.  However, an oversold condition can persist for an extended time.
*   The negative PPO confirms the downward momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal is recommending to use 90% of cash.
*   The recent decline in relative divergence supports the short-term downward trend.
*   The extremely negative Expected Return (%) is very concerning. It suggests that, based on the model, UBER is predicted to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Overall, the data paints a mixed and somewhat concerning picture for UBER stock.

*   **Underperformance:** UBER has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the expected return suggests this underperformance could continue.
*   **Downward Trend:** The recent price action, moving averages, RSI, and PPO all point to a downward trend.
*   **High Volatility:** The high MDD values highlight the stock's significant volatility.
*   **Conflicting Signals:**  While the MRI suggests a medium investment risk, the negative expected return is a major red flag. The analyst consensus is "Buy," but the wide range in target prices suggests uncertainty.
*   **Key Risks:** The news articles highlight concerns about competition from robotaxis, legal challenges, and factors driving recent weakness.
*   **Potential Upside:**  Some analysts believe UBER is undervalued and offers long-term potential, particularly with expansion into new markets and potential gains from AI. The oversold RSI could lead to a short term rebound.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in UBER appears risky at this time. While there are potential catalysts for future growth, the current data indicates significant challenges and underperformance. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and conduct further research before making a decision. The divergence between the generally positive analyst consensus and the negative indicators suggests a high degree of uncertainty.
