## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Summary:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global transportation network company connecting riders and drivers through its app.

The cumulative return of UBER (67.04%) lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) (83.23%) by 16.19 percentage points.  This places UBER at the 42.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided maximum and minimum deviations.  This indicates UBER's underperformance relative to the market benchmark.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (negative alpha) with high beta (generally above 50), indicating significant market sensitivity. While recent periods show positive CAGR,  the high MDD (maximum drawdown) highlights significant risk.  The fluctuating beta suggests volatility in market sensitivity across different periods.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 2.0% | 11.0% | -68.0% | -0.1 | 88.0 |

| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 23.9% | 1.0% | -0.1 | 130.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 56.0% | 23.9% | 24.0% | -0.1 | 127.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $65.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $65.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $62.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.53

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend.  It's significantly above the 20-day moving average, and below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term correction within a longer-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.01  (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 1.41 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +4.9% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -33.8%  (Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is projected over the long term)

The high RSI and negative expected return raise concerns despite the positive PPO and recent price gains. The -33.8% expected return is a strong negative indicator for long-term investment relative to the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Uber has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, showcasing positive surprises.  However, the large disparity between actual and expected EPS, particularly in Q1 2024 (-0.32 vs 0.22), indicates significant volatility and potential for future surprises.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2    | 0.41         |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47   | 0.31         |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32  | 0.2203       |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66   | 0.17         |
| 2023-11-07 | 0.1    | 0.12         |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is steadily increasing, and profit margins remain consistently high, demonstrating strong financial health.

| Quarter    | Equity       | ROE          |

| 2024-09-30 | $14.78B      | 17.67%       |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Uber demonstrates strong revenue growth and consistently high profit margins.  However, the stock's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, and the projected long-term underperformance (-33.8%) is a major concern.  The high beta indicates substantial market risk, while the volatile ROE and inconsistent alpha highlight uncertainty in future performance.  While recent earnings have been positive surprises, the substantial volatility in EPS and the potential for significant drawdowns necessitate caution.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high growth against the inherent risk.  A long-term investment strategy in UBER should be approached with a strong risk tolerance and careful monitoring of key performance indicators.
