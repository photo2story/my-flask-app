**Investment Recommendation Considerations:**

*   **Negative Factors:** Regulatory scrutiny is a significant risk, and the long-term expected return is very low. The historical performance of UBER versus the S&P 500 has been poor.
*   **Positive Factors:** Analysts have a "Buy" consensus and see significant upside potential in the stock. Robotaxis and other new investments may boost the stock in the future.

**Conclusion:**

The data paints a mixed picture. UBER's stock is currently being weighed down by regulatory issues, but positive analyst sentiments and long-term growth plans suggest a potential for future recovery.
