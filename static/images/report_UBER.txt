**0) Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (UBER):** 98.73%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 90.81%
* **Return Difference:** 7.92%
* **Relative Divergence:** 59.7% (This means UBER's outperformance relative to VOO is at the 59.7th percentile of its historical range.)


**1) Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a multinational ride-hailing company providing transportation services and food delivery.

The cumulative return of UBER significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the absolute difference is 7.92%, the relative divergence suggests this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical fluctuations.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating performance and risk metrics over different periods.  While recent years (2023-2025) show exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), this comes with increased risk (higher MDD - Maximum Drawdown).  Negative alpha consistently indicates underperformance relative to the market benchmark (after accounting for the systematic risk), while the beta indicates higher volatility than the S&P 500.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 2.0% | 11.0% | -68.0% | 88.3 |
| 2020-2022  | -35.0% | 23.9% | -43.0% | 52.1 |
| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 23.9% | 1.0% | 129.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 56.0% | 23.9% | -1.0 | 127.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 110.0% | 15.5% | -1.1 | 165.6 |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $68.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $66.93

The price is significantly above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent strong upward trend.  The price increased by $5.40 from the previous close, indicating a notable daily surge.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.11 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.37 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +19.0 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -17.1% (This indicates that even with the current outperformance, a long-term investment might yield 17.1% less than the S&P 500. This could be due to the high beta and negative alpha noted above.)


The substantial daily price increase (`change` value in `Last-market`)  indicates a recent significant price jump.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

UBER's recent performance shows strong short-term growth, exceeding the S&P 500.  However, the high beta, consistently negative alpha, and the projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns about sustainability. The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought in the short term. While earnings have been exceeding expectations recently, the long-term outlook needs further evaluation considering the risk profile indicated by the high beta and the negative expected return compared to the market.  Investors should carefully consider the volatile nature of UBER and the potential for significant drawdowns before making investment decisions.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the drivers of recent earnings growth and a comprehensive risk assessment, is recommended.
