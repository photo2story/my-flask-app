**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -32.0%   | 81.5%   | -51.0%  | 1.3  | 51.6   |
| 2021-2023  | 21.0%    | 81.5%   | -8.0%   | 1.6  | 128.4  |
| 2022-2024  | 61.0%    | 81.5%   | 31.0%   | 1.5  | 125.8  |
| 2023-2025  | 164.0%   | 78.8%   | 96.0%   | 1.3  | 170.4  |

*   **CAGR:**  The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows significant volatility. From a negative return of -32% (2020-2022) to a strong positive return of 164% (2023-2025).
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown remains high, indicating substantial risk, around 80%.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, which represents excess return compared to the market, ranges from highly negative to strongly positive, again highlighting volatility.  2023-2025 showing the best outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are consistently above 1, indicating UBER's price is more volatile than the market (S&P 500).
*    **Cap(B):** Market Cap in Billions, increasing in time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 81.71
*   **Previous Close:** 82.12
*   **Change:** -0.5
*   **5-day SMA:** 81.55
*   **20-day SMA:** 84.01
*   **60-day SMA:** 89.55

*   **Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), indicating a potential downtrend. The 5-day SMA is closest to the current price, while the 60-day SMA is significantly higher, suggesting that the recent price decline is a relatively new phenomenon compared to the broader trend over the past two months. The slight decrease from the previous close reinforces this short-term downward pressure.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.05 (Neither overbought nor oversold, but approaching oversold territory.)
*   **PPO:** 0.24 (Slightly positive, indicating potential upward momentum, but not strong.)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 90% (Suggests a strong buy signal based on the hybrid strategy.)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** 3.3 (+), indicates a short-term increase.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0% (Indicates neutral long-term expectation compared to S&P500.)

*   **Analysis:** MRI recommends high investment, while RSI is in neutral territory. Recent increase divergence and the hybrid signal point to a potentially positive short-term trend. The 'Expected Return' being 0% suggests that analysts are not confident in UBER outperforming the S&P 500 in the long term. The negative price change compared to the previous close means there is recent downward pressure.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Key Themes:** Legal risks, inclusion in "forever" stock lists, potential acquisition (SpotHero), regulatory and EV concerns, and mentions in lists of stocks for 2026.

*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 111.84 / 150.00 / 78.00
*   **Analysis:** Analyst sentiment is generally positive with a consensus "Buy" rating and an average target price significantly higher than the current price (81.71). However, the range of target prices is wide (78.00 to 150.00), which indicates uncertainty.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** UBER's stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative return.  Recent price action shows a short-term downtrend, and the stock is trading below its 20 and 60-day moving averages. The MRI indicates it is good investment time, the RSI sits in a neutral territory.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Positive:** Strong revenue growth (as indicated by positive CAGR in recent years), analyst "Buy" consensus, potential for long-term growth (mentions in "forever" stock lists), and potential upside from acquisitions.
    *   **Negative:** High volatility (high MDD and Beta), regulatory and EV concerns, and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Recommendation:** The analyst consensus recommends buying the stock. Given the relatively low return rate compared to VOO, you might wait for better entry opportunity.
