## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-hailing and food delivery company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over a period. However, recent performance indicators are mixed, requiring deeper analysis.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **UBER Cumulative Return:** 92.11%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 86.93%
* **Return Difference:** 5.18%
* **Relative Divergence:** 57.7% (This indicates UBER's performance is in the upper 57.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO, based on provided min/max values of -74% and 63.2% respectively).

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO) across different periods. While showing high growth in certain periods, negative alphas indicate underperformance against the benchmark in some time frames.  The high Beta values across all periods suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization fluctuates significantly.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Uber has demonstrated strong revenue growth and relatively consistent profitability. However, its performance relative to the S&P 500 is volatile and the long-term outlook is uncertain based on provided data.  While recent earnings significantly beat expectations, the high Beta and negative Alpha in several periods highlight significant market risk. The fluctuating ROE and equity figures also raise some concerns regarding financial stability.  Further investigation into the drivers of the significant Q1 2025 EPS beat and the reasons for the Q1 2024 negative ROE are crucial before making any investment decision.  The negative projected long-term return relative to VOO should be carefully considered.
