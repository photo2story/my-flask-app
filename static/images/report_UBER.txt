## UBER Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500:**

Uber Technologies Inc, a ride-hailing and delivery services company, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  UBER's cumulative return is 56.03%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has returned 91.65%, resulting in a -35.6% difference. The relative divergence of 28.0 indicates that UBER's performance relative to the S&P 500 is in the lower 28th percentile of its historical range.

The alpha/beta analysis shows consistently negative alphas, especially in the 2019-2022 period, indicating underperformance compared to the benchmark.  The negative beta suggests that UBER tends to move inversely to the market, though with a small magnitude.  Market capitalization has grown significantly.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

UBER's closing price is 61.03, slightly below the last market price of 63.76. Short-term trends are mixed: the 5-day moving average (60.76) is slightly below the current price, suggesting potential upward momentum, while the 20-day (67.54) and 60-day (73.38) moving averages are significantly higher, indicating a recent downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 23.29 indicates that UBER is currently oversold, suggesting a potential buying opportunity. The negative PPO (-1.24) confirms the downward momentum.  The recent decrease in relative divergence (-7.6) over the past 20 days further reinforces the short-term bearish trend.  The expected return of 0.0% versus the S&P 500 over the long term suggests no outperformance is anticipated.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

UBER has demonstrated positive EPS growth in the last two reported quarters.  The Q3 2024 EPS of $1.20 significantly beat expectations of $0.41. Similarly, Q2 2024 EPS of $0.47 surpassed estimates of $0.31.  However, Q1 2024 saw a negative EPS of -$0.32, missing the expected $0.22.  Q4 2023 also saw a miss, with $0.10 EPS versus $0.12 expected. The recent trend suggests improved profitability, although previous quarters showed volatility.  Revenue growth trends cannot be definitively assessed from the provided EPS data alone.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has steadily increased over the past five quarters, from $9.29B in Q3 2023 to $11.19B in Q3 2024.  Profit margins have remained remarkably stable, hovering around 39%.  ROE has fluctuated considerably, with a substantial increase in the most recent quarter to 17.67%, following negative ROE in Q1 2024.  Equity has also grown consistently, indicating a strengthening financial position.

**7. Summary:**

UBER has underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. Despite recent positive earnings surprises and consistent revenue growth, the stock's price has been trending downwards.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is currently oversold, potentially presenting a buying opportunity.  However, the negative alpha and long-term expected return of 0.0% suggest caution. Further research into recent news and analyst opinions is recommended before making investment decisions. The company's improving profitability and growing equity are positive factors, but overall performance relative to the market needs to be closely monitored.
