**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 2.0% | 11.0% | -68.0% | -0.1 | 95.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -35.0% | 23.9% | -43.0% | -0.3 | 56.2 |
| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 23.9% | 1.0% | -1.0 | 139.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 56.0% | 23.9% | 24.0% | -1.0 | 137.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 88.0% | 15.5% | 27.0% | -1.1 | 158.9 |

Uber consistently shows a negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The beta fluctuates, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements over time. The market capitalization (Cap) has grown significantly during the period.  The high negative alpha values raise concerns about the stock's ability to generate returns above the market average.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $69.99
* **Last Market Price:** $75.52 (7.9% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $67.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $67.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $66.77

The recent price of $75.52 shows a significant jump from the previous close and is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  However, the jump warrants caution as it might be a temporary surge rather than a sustainable trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 53.75 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.097 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.9% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -30.2% (Long-term underperformance relative to S&P 500 expected)

The positive PPO and recent relative divergence suggest some positive momentum, however, the relatively low RSI and dramatically negative expected return suggest caution. The large price jump from the previous close needs to be observed carefully; it could indicate a short-term surge followed by a correction.

Uber shows consistent revenue growth and a stable profit margin. However, ROE fluctuates significantly, indicating variability in profitability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

UBER's recent financial performance, particularly its exceeding earnings expectations, is positive.  However, its persistent negative alpha and significantly lower cumulative return compared to the S&P 500 raise concerns. The recent price surge needs to be monitored for sustainability.  The projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-30.2%) is a major factor to consider. While the company shows strong revenue growth and a healthy profit margin, the volatile ROE and negative alpha suggest a higher-than-average risk profile.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent earnings beat and the factors contributing to the negative alpha is crucial before making investment decisions.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for future growth against the historical and projected underperformance compared to the broader market.
