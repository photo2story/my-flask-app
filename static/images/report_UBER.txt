| 2023-2025  | 62.0%    | 77.8% | -1.0%   | -0.3   | 205.3  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows highly variable performance across different periods. The recent 2023-2025 period shows strong growth (62%), but earlier periods had significant negative growth.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant price volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is mostly negative or low, suggesting UBER has not consistently outperformed the market on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values are near zero or slightly negative, indicating UBER's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market.  A negative beta suggests a slight inverse relationship (though very weak).
*   **Cap(B):**  The market capitalization has fluctuated significantly over these periods, reaching a high in the most recent period.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

**Numbers:**

*   Current Price: 96.61
*   Previous Close: 96.61
*   Change: 0.0
*   5-day Moving Average: 97.558
*   20-day Moving Average: 96.1555
*   60-day Moving Average: 93.4751

**Analysis:**

The current price is unchanged from the previous close, indicating no price movement today. The 5-day moving average is slightly above the current price, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend.  The 20-day and 60-day moving averages are below the current price, indicating a longer-term upward trend.

### 3. Market Risk Indicator and Technical Indicators

**Numbers:**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 54.2567
*   PPO: -0.0984
*   Hybrid Signal: Buy 100% of cash (399 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change: -4.3 (downward trend)
*   Expected Return (%): -30.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.9 suggests a "High Investment Recommended" level of risk, which is somewhat contradictory given the performance analysis.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 54.25 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -0.0984 indicates that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend or lack of strong momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying with 100% of available cash, which is inconsistent with the expected return of -30.1%. The system may be weighting MRI too heavily.
*   **Relative Spread Change:** The recent decline in the relative spread indicates that UBER's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 has worsened recently.
*   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return (-30.1%) is concerning, suggesting that, based on the model, a long-term investment in UBER is expected to underperform the S&P 500.
*   **Price Change:** The 'change': 0.0 indicates no immediate price volatility requiring special consideration.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **DailyPay CEO Replacement:** This could have implications for Uber's payment processing partnerships, though the direct impact is unclear without more information.
*   **Ursa Major Board Appointments:** This is unlikely to directly impact Uber.
*   **Serve Robotics Expansion with Uber Eats:** Positive news, suggesting growth in autonomous delivery and increased integration with Uber's platform. Mizuho's Outperform rating and $130 PT reinforce this positive outlook.
*   **Instacart News:** Indirectly relevant as a competitor in the delivery space.
*   **DSW and Uber Eats Collaboration:** Positive news, expanding Uber Eats' delivery offerings and partnerships.
*   **American Express News:** Not directly relevant to Uber.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean 1.60)
*   **Target Price:** $107.62 (Average), $150.00 (High), $82.00 (Low)

**Analysis:**

Analysts generally have a positive outlook on UBER, with a "Buy" consensus and an average target price above the current price. However, the wide range in target prices suggests some uncertainty.  The lack of recent rating changes indicated means there's no new sentiment pushing toward dramatic changes.

*   **Equity:**  Equity has steadily increased, indicating a strengthening financial position.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) has fluctuated, with a significant spike in Q4 2024. This could be due to specific events or accounting adjustments in that quarter. Recent ROE is lower than the peak but is still positive.

### 7. Overall Summary

**In summary:**

*   UBER has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly.
*   Recent performance data (2023-2025) shows higher CAGR (62.0%).
*   Recent EPS reports show Uber consistently exceeding expectations.
*   Revenue, profit margin, and equity are growing.
*   Analysts generally rate the stock as a buy.
*   Market Risk Indicator recommends investment, but the expected return is negative.

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis paints a mixed picture. UBER's stock has underperformed the broader market, and the model predicts continued underperformance. The stock exhibits high risk due to its high drawdowns, though recent performance has improved. Despite this, the company is generating strong revenue and profit margins, consistently exceeding earnings expectations. The fact analysts have a positive outlook and current MRI suggest 'High investment recommended' adds confusion to the outlook.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. While the company's financial performance is improving, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the negative expected return should give investors pause. Monitor the autonomous delivery expansion with Uber Eats, and how this is driving change. It might be prudent to wait for a clearer trend or further improvements in relative performance before making a significant investment. Consider the analyst consensus with some skepticism, given the contradictory data. The Hybrid Signal is also unreliable given the poor expected return.
