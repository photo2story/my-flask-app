## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-hailing company providing transportation and food delivery services.

The cumulative return of UBER is 87.05%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 95.48%.  This results in a difference of -8.4%.  The relative divergence of -8.4% places UBER at the 52.0th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum divergence of -77.2% and a maximum of 55.1%).  This indicates UBER's underperformance compared to the broader market, though not exceptionally so given its historical volatility.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 0.3% | 62.0% | -25.7% | 2.6 | 88.3 |
| 2020-2022  | -7.2% | 62.0% | -14.6% | 2.5 | 52.1 |
| 2021-2023  | 6.4% | 52.9% | -4.1% | 2.9 | 129.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 18.7% | 47.2% | 9.4% | 2.8 | 150.6 |

The high Beta values consistently above 2 indicate that UBER's price is significantly more volatile than the overall market.  Negative Alpha values in the earlier periods suggest underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return, while the positive Alpha in 2022-2024 shows some outperformance, though this needs to be considered in light of the high volatility.  Market capitalization has increased significantly over the period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $73.42 (Last Market: $71.6)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $72.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $74.68

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the longer term.  The recent jump from $71.6 suggests a minor but relatively quick price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 47.38 -  Near the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.08 - A positive value indicates upward momentum, but it's relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -13.2% - Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.


Given that the last market price ($71.6) was lower than the closing price ($73.42), there was a recent minor upward movement, not a sharp rebound.

**Expected Return:** 0.0% â€“ This indicates that, based on the provided data, no significant excess return over the S&P 500 is anticipated from a long-term (2+ years) investment.  This needs further investigation using more sophisticated models.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows a mixed performance picture.  While revenue and profitability are generally increasing, earnings are volatile, and the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been inconsistent, particularly showing underperformance in earlier periods.  High Beta indicates significant volatility.  Recent earnings significantly beat expectations, but historical inconsistency makes future prediction challenging.  A deeper dive into the causes of fluctuating ROE and a thorough review of recent news are necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.  The provided 0.0% expected return is tentative and needs further modeling with more robust data and predictive techniques.
