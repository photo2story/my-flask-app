**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-sharing and food delivery company.  The following analysis uses provided data to assess UBER's performance.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

UBER's cumulative return (87.56%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (83.63%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 3.9%, placing it at the 56.8th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range (-74% to 63.2%). This suggests relatively strong performance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 2.0% | 11.0% | -68.0% | -0.1 | 87.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -35.0% | 23.9% | -43.0% | -0.3 | 51.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 23.9% | 1.0% | -1.0 | 128.6 |

| 2023-2025  | 99.0% | 15.5% | 45.0% | -1.1 | 155.0 |

The analysis shows significant volatility in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different periods. Negative alpha values across all periods suggest UBER underperformed the market benchmark (presumably the S&P 500) after adjusting for its beta.  The high beta values indicate higher volatility than the market.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has shown substantial growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term. The recent price drop of $2.19 (from previous close) indicates a significant short-term decline.

| 날짜       | EPS      | 예상 EPS   |

Uber significantly exceeded earnings expectations in several quarters, particularly in the latest reported quarter.  However, the earlier quarters show a considerable gap between actual and expected EPS.  This volatility in earnings needs further investigation.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue      | Profit Margin |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity       | ROE           |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.56B      | 31.93%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78B      | 17.67%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $11.25B      | 12.70%        |

Equity shows substantial growth, while ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, indicating some variability in profitability relative to shareholder equity.  Negative ROE in Q1 2024 is a concern.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

UBER has shown strong revenue growth and consistently high profit margins.  However, the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 is mixed; while the cumulative return is currently positive,  the negative alpha and significant volatility highlighted by the beta and MDD suggest considerable risk.  Recent price action shows a sharp decline. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, historical earnings show considerable volatility.  The long-term outlook (2+ years) shows a predicted underperformance compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided expected return.  Further analysis is needed to assess the sustainability of revenue growth and address the concerning volatility in earnings, ROE, and price.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent risk before investing.
