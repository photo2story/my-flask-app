## Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) is a ride-hailing and food delivery company.  The provided data shows UBER's cumulative return of 71.21% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 89.14% over the analyzed period.  This represents a difference of -17.9%.  The relative divergence of -17.9% places UBER at the 40.9th percentile of its historical divergence range (max: 63.2%, min: -74.0%). This suggests UBER has underperformed the S&P 500, but not dramatically so compared to its historical performance against the index.

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows UBER consistently has a negative alpha (-0.1), indicating underperformance compared to the market benchmark,  across different time periods.  Its beta, consistently around 142,  suggests high volatility.  However, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows improvement over time, culminating in a substantial 99% increase between 2023-2025. This substantial increase in CAGR however should be examined critically in the context of the overall analysis.

Uber has consistently exceeded expectations in recent quarters, except for the quarter ending May 8th, 2024. This positive surprise in earnings is a significant bullish indicator, especially given the considerable outperformance in October 2024's earnings.  Further investigation into the reasons for the May 2024 miss is warranted.

Equity has also increased significantly, although ROE fluctuates.  The negative ROE in Q1 2024 is a concerning point needing further investigation.


**7. Overall Summary:**

Uber shows strong revenue growth and consistent high profit margins.  Recent earnings have mostly exceeded expectations, which is a positive signal. However, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting significant volatility and a negative alpha. While the long-term expected return is negative compared to the S&P 500, the positive recent earnings and substantial growth in CAGR suggests a potential for future gains. A more thorough analysis of the negative ROE in Q1 2024 and the May 2024 earnings miss are crucial before reaching a definitive conclusion.  The high beta suggests considerable risk, so investors should proceed with caution.  Further research into the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape is recommended.
