| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 4.0% | 59.1% | -69.0% | 0.1 | 87.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -31.0% | 68.7% | -52.0% | 0.2 | 51.7 |

| 2023-2025  | 69.0% | 81.3% | 67.0% | -0.1 | 135.1 |

**Analysis of Alpha and Beta:**  The Alpha and Beta values fluctuate significantly year-over-year, indicating periods of both outperformance (positive alpha) and underperformance (negative alpha) relative to the market (Beta).  The high beta values suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. The significant negative alpha in 2022-2024 is concerning.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $64.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $72.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $72.41

The current price is significantly below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent drop of -$7.49 indicates a potential downturn.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4653 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 32.28 (Oversold territory; often signals a potential bounce, but not guaranteed)
* **PPO:** -1.07 (Negative value suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +5.9 (Short-term upward movement, but context suggests this may be a temporary bounce)
* **Expected Return:** -12.7% (This negative expected return should be interpreted cautiously given the significant recent drop and the lack of context on the calculation methodology).  This is a significant negative expected return, suggesting that there are factors currently negatively influencing the stock. This figure does not appear to take into account the large negative return experienced in the last week. The long term expected return compared to the S&P 500 is also not provided.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | EPS Surprise |
|------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21     | 0.5          | +2.71         |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2      | 0.41         | +0.79         |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47     | 0.31         | +0.16         |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32    | 0.2203       | -0.5403       |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66     | 0.17         | +0.49         |

**Analysis:** Uber has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters, except for Q2 2024.  The significant positive surprise in Q1 2025 is noteworthy but needs further investigation to understand the drivers behind this sharp increase.  The recent negative EPS surprise may contribute to the current negative market sentiment.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |

| 2024-12-31 | $11.96B   | 39.51%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $11.19B   | 39.57%        |

| 2024-03-31 | $10.13B   | 39.12%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.94B    | 39.04%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE           |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.56B   | 31.93%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78B   | 17.67%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.35B   | 8.22%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.06B   | -5.91%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $11.25B   | 12.70%        |

**Analysis:**  Revenue shows steady growth, and profit margins remain consistently high.  However, ROE fluctuates significantly, indicating variability in profitability relative to equity.  The negative ROE in Q1 2024 is concerning.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UBER has shown periods of strong performance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in the longer term cumulative returns. However, recent price action shows a significant drop and technical indicators suggest bearish momentum.  While earnings have generally exceeded expectations, the negative ROE and recent EPS miss raise concerns.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity, implying higher risk for investors. The -12.7% expected return is a major concern, and this, along with the recent price action, suggest a significant need for additional research to determine whether this is a short term dip, or a long term bearish signal.  Further investigation into the drivers of recent price movement and the significant Q1 2025 earnings surprise is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The information provided is insufficient to confidently assess the long-term S&P 500 outperformance potential.
