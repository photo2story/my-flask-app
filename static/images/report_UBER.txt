**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B)   |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| 2019-2021  | -18.0%   | 78.6%   | -61.0%  | 0.0    | 88.1     |

| 2021-2023  | -3.0%    | 77.8%   | -4.0%   | -0.1   | 129.3    |

| 2023-2025  | 52.0%    | 77.8%   | -14.0%  | -0.3   | 190.4    |

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating CAGR over different periods, with negative returns in early periods and positive returns in more recent periods.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant potential for loss.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally negative, indicating UBER has underperformed relative to its benchmark. However, it turns positive (13.0%) in 2022-2024.
*   **Beta:** Beta values near zero or negative suggest UBER's price is not highly correlated with the overall market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** $90.68
*   **Last-market:** Price at $91.32, Previous Close at $90.99, Change is $0.36.
*   **5-day SMA:** 88.37
*   **20-day SMA:** 89.52
*   **60-day SMA:** 93.82

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day SMAs, but below its 60-day SMA. This suggests a recent upward trend, but it needs to break above the 60-day SMA to confirm a stronger bullish signal.

**3) Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment).  Suggests a moderate level of risk associated with the investment.
*   **RSI:** 42.34.  This is below 50 and is approaching the oversold level (typically below 30).  This *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, but it also reflects underlying weakness.
*   **PPO:** 0.382. This is not necessarily useful without seeing the recent historical trend for that particular indicator.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash. Suggests a bullish signal based on this particular strategy, given the MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -3.5 (Negative). Suggests a short-term downward trend relative to the comparison (S&P 500).
*   **Expected Return:** -83.5%.  This is a *very* negative indicator. It projects significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term if the investment is made at this point.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Robotaxi Service Launch:** Uber is launching robotaxi services in Dallas with Waymo. This suggests innovation and expansion into autonomous driving.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Articles suggest potential for growth stocks and long-term opportunities for Uber.
*   **Legal Expenses Impact:** Recent operating profit was impacted by legal expenses.
*   **Stock Trading Activity:** An article discusses recent trading activity.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean 1.54)
*   **Target Price:** Average $111.86, High $150.00, Low $84.00. This indicates analysts expect significant upside potential.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Mixed Signals:** The analysis presents a mixed picture. UBER has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 historically. However, recent analyst consensus is "Buy," with a substantial target price increase. The company is also innovating with robotaxi services.
*   **Underperformance:** Uber's cumulative return has underperformed the S&P 500, as indicated by the divergence. Alpha values are generally negative in the provided periods, although it becomes positive in the period of 2022-2024.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The RSI is nearing oversold territory, while the short-term moving averages suggest recent upward movement, but still below the 60-day SMA. The highly negative Expected Return is a major red flag.
*   **News Impact:** The news highlights both potential growth areas (robotaxis, analyst optimism) and challenges (legal expenses).
*   **Investment Recommendation:**  The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium investment level, which seems odd when combined with the projected -83.5% Expected Return. The analyst consensus is a strong buy, but be cautious. Investors need to weigh the growth potential, analyst optimism, and technological innovation against the historical underperformance, the negative expected return, and recent concerns.
*   **Key Consideration:** The massive projected *under*performance based on the "Expected Return (%)" figure must be investigated further and given serious weight. Why is the expected return so extremely low? Is this a data error, or is there a fundamental problem with the investment prospects of the stock?

**In summary, while analyst opinions are positive and the company is pursuing innovative ventures, investors should proceed with caution and thoroughly investigate the discrepancy between the analyst consensus and the extremely negative expected return. A deeper dive into the reasons for the low projected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.**
