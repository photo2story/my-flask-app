* **20-Day Moving Average:** $72.94

The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a key concern for long-term investors.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Uber has shown significant improvement in EPS compared to expectations in recent quarters.  The substantial beat on EPS in Q1 2025 is especially noteworthy. However, prior quarters show variability in EPS, and some periods of losses. Consistent profitability remains to be seen.


| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21   | 0.5           |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2    | 0.41          |

Revenue shows steady growth, and profit margins remain consistently high. However, equity and ROE fluctuate, suggesting some volatility in the company's financial health.  A significant increase in equity is observed from Q2 2024 to Q4 2024.  The negative ROE in Q1 2024 raises concerns about profitability during that period.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

UBER shows significant short-term growth and outperformance against the S&P 500, supported by strong recent earnings and revenue growth. However, the high beta, overbought RSI, and negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggest caution.  The volatility in previous periods and the fluctuation in ROE highlight considerable risk. While the recent positive trends are encouraging, investors should carefully consider the potential for significant price corrections and the long-term uncertainty before making any investment decisions. Further due diligence and analysis of future earnings and market conditions are crucial.
