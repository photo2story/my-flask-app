**1. Performance Comparison and Overview:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global transportation network company connecting riders and drivers through a mobile app.  UBER has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, achieving a cumulative return of 101.83% compared to VOO's 72.29%.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 8.0% | 22.7% | -63.0% | -0.1 | 84.5 |
| 2020-2022  | -30.0% | 54.4% | -41.0% | -0.1 | 49.9 |
| 2021-2023  | 21.0% | 54.4% | 3.0% | -1.1 | 124.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 75.0% | 55.5% | 52.0% | -1.2 | 121.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 109.0% | 55.5% | 66.0% | -0.5 | 150.9 |

**Analysis of Alpha and Beta:** The negative alpha values across several periods suggest UBER has underperformed the market after adjusting for risk (beta).  The high beta values indicate significant price volatility, making it a riskier investment than the market average.  However, recent periods (2022-2025) show a significant improvement in CAGR and a reduction in the negative alpha.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $74.86
* **5-day Moving Average:** $75.40
* **20-day Moving Average:** $73.90
* **60-day Moving Average:** $71.64

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting some short-term downward pressure.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potentially positive longer-term trend.  The recent price drop (-$0.82) reflects a slight negative movement.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.52 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.18 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -8.0% (Negative expected return at current price)
* **Long-Term Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):**  The provided data doesn't directly give a long-term expected return versus the S&P 500, but the consistently higher cumulative returns compared to VOO suggest potential for continued outperformance, although risk remains high.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21     | 0.5          | +2.71      |

| 2024-02-07 | 0.66     | 0.17         | +0.49      |

**Analysis:** Uber has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, except for Q2 2024. This positive trend strongly suggests a healthy financial outlook, although considerable volatility still appears present.  The significant positive EPS surprises, especially in the latest reporting period, are noteworthy and suggest potential for upward price momentum.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, indicating solid underlying business performance.  Despite a negative alpha in some periods, recent strong earnings beats and a considerably higher cumulative return compared to the S&P 500 suggest a potentially positive long-term outlook.  However, the high beta indicates significant volatility and risk.  The current price is slightly below short-term moving averages but above longer-term averages, which could suggest a consolidation phase after a recent period of growth.  The moderately high relative divergence and positive PPO suggest continued upward potential in the medium term; however, investors should be prepared for substantial price fluctuations.   A long-term (2+ years) investment approach, with regular contributions and a tolerance for significant risk, could potentially yield above-market returns, given the company's impressive recent performance and positive financial outlook.  Careful monitoring of market conditions and further fundamental analysis are essential for informed decision-making.
