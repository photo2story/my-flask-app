| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | 0.9%     | 62.0%   | -99.2% | 1.2   | 88.3   |
| 2020-2022  | -20.2%   | 62.0%   | -43.8% | 1.3   | 52.1   |
| 2021-2023  | 20.4%    | 52.9%   | -14.6% | 1.6   | 129.7  |
| 2022-2024  | 58.5%    | 47.2%   | 28.8%  | 1.5   | 146.6  |

**Analysis:** UBER's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the entire period considered.  While the most recent period (2022-2024) shows strong positive CAGR, the overall picture reveals significant volatility and underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The negative Alpha values across multiple periods suggest underperformance relative to the market, adjusted for beta.  The high beta values indicate higher volatility than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $69.64 (Last Market: $71.51)
* 5-Day Moving Average: $70.19
* 20-Day Moving Average: $73.14
* 60-Day Moving Average: $74.69

**Analysis:** The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent drop from $71.51 to $69.64 reinforces this observation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* RSI: 33.64 (Oversold territory)
* PPO: -0.57 (Bearish)
* 20-Day Relative Divergence Change: -21.19 (Short-term decline)
* Expected Return (2+ years): 0.0% (This implies no significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term)

**Analysis:** The RSI and PPO indicators both point to oversold conditions and bearish momentum.  The negative relative divergence confirms a downward trend. The projected 0% expected return suggests that even with a long-term investment, UBER might not significantly outperform the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2      | 0.41           |

| 2023-11-07 | 0.1       | 0.12           |

**Analysis:**  The most recent earnings (October 31, 2024) significantly exceeded expectations. However, previous quarters show some variability, with some misses and beats.  Overall, the recent positive surprise might suggest improvement but further data is needed to assess the long-term sustainability of this trend.
