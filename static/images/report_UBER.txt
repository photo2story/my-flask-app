**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global transportation network company connecting riders and drivers through its mobile app.  UBER's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by 28.2 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 80.0% suggests UBER's performance has been considerably stronger than VOO's over the period considered, at least based on the provided data.  However, the provided CAGR figures show a volatile performance year-over-year.  While significant gains are apparent in the 2022-2025 period, earlier periods show substantial losses, emphasizing the risk associated with the stock.  The high beta values indicate substantial price volatility relative to the overall market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 8.0% | 22.7% | -63.0% | -0.1 | 86.9 |
| 2020-2022  | -30.0% | 54.4% | -41.0% | -0.1 | 51.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 21.0% | 54.4% | 3.0% | -1.1 | 127.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 75.0% | 55.5% | 52.0% | -1.2 | 125.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $72.86
* **Last Market Price:** $72.32
* **5-day Moving Average:** $74.05
* **20-day Moving Average:** $73.66
* **60-day Moving Average:** $72.04

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.  The recent small price drop (-$0.74) does not indicate a dramatic shift.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.57 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.13 (Slightly bearish)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.9 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years):** -8.1% (relative to S&P 500)

The technical indicators paint a mixed picture. While the RSI is not alarmingly high, the negative PPO and recent relative divergence suggest a bearish short-term trend.  The negative expected return highlights the risk involved, suggesting that while UBER has outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, it is projected to underperform in the long run based on the current model.

| 2025-02-05 | 3.21      | 0.5       | +2.71       |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2       | 0.41      | +0.79       |

| 2024-02-07 | 0.66      | 0.17      | +0.49       |

Uber has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters except for Q2 2024.  This positive trend suggests strong underlying performance. However, relying solely on EPS beats is not a complete analysis and requires a deeper dive into the financial statements.

| 2023-12-31 | $11.25B   | 12.70%       |

Revenue shows consistent growth throughout the year, with high and stable profit margins. However, ROE fluctuates significantly, indicating volatility in profitability.  The negative ROE in Q1 2024 warrants further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

UBER's past performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but this has been volatile.  While recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations, the projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is negative.  Technical indicators suggest a mixed outlook, with a bearish short-term trend.  The significant fluctuations in ROE and the high beta raise concerns about risk.  Further investigation into the factors driving ROE fluctuations and a more comprehensive risk assessment are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high growth and current profitability of the company are promising, but significant risks remain, calling for careful consideration.
