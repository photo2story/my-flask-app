|------------|--------|--------|--------|------|--------|

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Uber has experienced volatile CAGR over the periods analyzed, including significant negative growth in 2019-2021 and 2020-2022, but recently improved in 2022-2025
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently high, around 78%, indicating significant potential for loss from peak to trough during these periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally negative, suggesting Uber underperforms relative to its benchmark, except for the 2022-2024 period.  The large negative alpha in 2019-2021 and 2023-2025 is concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates around 0, indicating UBER's price is not much related to the S&P500.
*   **Cap(B):** The Capitalization (in Billions) has been growing over the period, suggesting investor confidence in the long term.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 79.69
*   **Last-market price:** 79.69, previous close: 79.14, change: 0.69
*   **5-day SMA:** 81.34
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.86
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.79

**Analysis:**

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This suggests a recent downward trend. The price increase (change: 0.69) indicates a possible short-term rebound but is not significant enough to counter the downward trend.

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 32.12
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.97

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -12.4 (Negative Trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -214.8%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment rating suggests moderate risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 32.12 indicates the stock is approaching *oversold* conditions, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity for some investors.  However, an oversold condition can persist for a while.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This recommends buying using cash.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is *very* concerning.  This suggests that, based on the model used, the stock is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term from its current price.
