**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-sharing and food delivery company.  Over the period analyzed, UBER has outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by 8.11% in cumulative returns.  While this suggests a stronger performance, the relative divergence metric highlights that this outperformance is not exceptionally unusual within the historical context of its performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 2.0% | 11.0% | -68.0% | -0.1 | 88.3 |
| 2020-2022  | -35.0% | 23.9% | -43.0% | -0.3 | 52.1 |
| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 23.9% | 1.0% | -1.0 | 129.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 56.0% | 23.9% | 24.0% | -1.0 | 127.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 112.0% | 15.5% | 50.0% | -1.1 | 167.2 |

**Analysis:**  The data shows significant volatility in UBER's performance (high MDD values).  The negative alpha consistently suggests underperformance relative to the market benchmark adjusted for risk (beta).  However, the recent years (2022-2025) show a dramatic improvement in CAGR, suggesting a potential positive trend. The decreasing beta might indicate reduced market sensitivity.

* **PPO:** 1.70 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum)

**Capital and Profitability:** *(Data missing from your provided information)*


**Analysis:** Revenue is consistently increasing, and profit margins remain relatively stable and high.  Further analysis requires the missing capital and profitability data (Equity and ROE).


**6. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows a mixed picture. While recent performance has been strong, exceeding earnings expectations and exhibiting positive price momentum, historical data reveals significant volatility and consistent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 when considering risk-adjusted returns (Alpha).  The high RSI suggests a potential short-term correction might be likely. The company's strong revenue growth and stable profit margins are positive factors.  However, the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 (over the long term) needs careful consideration before making any investment decisions.  More detailed analysis of capital and profitability metrics, along with a thorough examination of the company's long-term strategic plans and competitive landscape, is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.
