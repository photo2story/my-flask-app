**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Uber Technologies Inc. is a global mobility and delivery platform connecting riders and drivers, and consumers with restaurants and stores.
*   **UBER Cumulative Return:** 20.05%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 78.83%
*   **Divergence:**

    *   Relative Divergence: 3.7 (meaning the current divergence is near the bottom of its historical range).

The relative divergence suggests that this underperformance is near its worst point historically within the examined data.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|--------|

| 2022-2024  | 34.0%   | 77.8% | 13.0%  | -0.1  | 125.8  |
| 2023-2025  | 40.0%   | 77.8% | -27.0% | -0.3  | 171.2  |

**Analysis of Table:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows inconsistent performance. While recent periods (2022-2024, 2023-2025) show positive growth, earlier periods had significant negative growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures performance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). The negative alpha values in several periods reinforce the underperformance compared to the market. Even when recent alpha is positive (13%), the latest alpha has again become negative.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures volatility relative to the market. A Beta near zero (or negative) suggests Uber is less correlated with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** This value shows the market capitalization of Uber in billions of dollars.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 82.12
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 82.12, Previous Close: 81.5, Change: 0.76
*   **5-day SMA:** 81.4
*   **20-day SMA:** 84.45
*   **60-day SMA:** 89.90

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below both its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downward trend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, further reinforcing this trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 29.33 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.13
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" (Very Safe, Oversold Boost)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -2.1 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -428.2% (Significant expected underperformance relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI score seemingly contradicts the other indicators. Typically an MRI this high would indicate a strong buy signal, however the other figures are contradictory.
*   The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which could signal a potential rebound. The Hybrid signal also confirms this (buy recommendation).
*   However, the negative expected return is a major concern, suggesting that long-term investment in UBER might significantly underperform the broader market based on the models used.

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and a significant upside potential based on the average target price. However, the range of target prices is quite wide ($78 - $150), indicating uncertainty.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** UBER has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the negative divergence highlights this lag.
*   **Volatility:** The high MDD in the Alpha, Beta analysis table confirms the stock's volatile nature.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators provide mixed signals. RSI suggests it is oversold while the Moving Averages suggest a short-term decline. The MRI shows a high buy signal that contradicts the expected return.
*   **News Sentiment:** News is mixed, with some articles presenting buying opportunities while others warn of ongoing challenges.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts remain generally optimistic, with a consensus "Buy" rating.

**Overall Conclusion:**

UBER presents a complex investment picture. While analysts are generally optimistic and the stock may be oversold in the short term, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the negative expected return raise serious concerns. The mixed news sentiment further complicates the decision. The high MRI indicator contradicts other factors, and should be viewed with caution.

**Recommendation:**

Given the data, a cautious approach is warranted. It may be prudent to wait for more consistent positive signals, such as improved financial performance, positive revisions of expected returns, or resolution of the regulatory and EV-related concerns highlighted in the news. While the oversold condition and analyst ratings might tempt some investors, the risks and underperformance compared to the broader market should be carefully considered.
