## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global transportation network company connecting riders and drivers through a mobile app.  The provided data shows a strong recent performance, but with some volatility.  Further analysis below will detail the performance relative to the S&P 500 and assess potential risks and opportunities.


**1. Performance Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **UBER Cumulative Return:** 93.14%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 88.04%
* **Return Difference:** 5.10%

UBER has outperformed the S&P 500 by 5.10% over the analyzed period.  The relative divergence (57.7) indicates this outperformance is relatively high compared to historical performance fluctuations.  However, this is just a snapshot and doesn't account for the risk taken to achieve this return.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO).  High beta values (especially in 2019-2021) suggest significant market sensitivity, while the negative alphas indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark in most periods.  The recent positive CAGR and improved alpha in 2023-2025 are encouraging but need further investigation.  Market capitalization has increased significantly, reflecting market confidence.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 2.0% | 11.0% | -68.0% | 87.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -35.0% | 23.9% | -43.0% | 51.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 23.9% | 1.0% | 128.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 56.0% | 23.9% | -1.0 | 126.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 105.0% | 15.5% | -1.1 | 159.6 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $76.42
* **Previous Close:** $78.89
* **Change:** -$2.47 (a significant drop of -3.13%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $79.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.85
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.24

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term. The recent drop is notable.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 63.00  (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 0.23 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum, although relatively weak.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.1 (Negative, indicating a recent weakening of the uptrend.)

The recent price drop of $2.47 reflects a notable market movement, indicating a bearish correction, potentially due to various factors influencing investor sentiment.


The expected return of -17.6% is concerning, especially given the already seen significant drop in price. This suggests that despite the relative outperformance against VOO, there's a significant risk involved.  Long-term investment should consider this risk carefully.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference     |
|------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21     | 0.5           | +2.71 (Massive Beat) |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2      | 0.41          | +0.79 (Significant Beat) |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47     | 0.31          | +0.16 (Positive Surprise) |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32    | 0.2203        | -0.54 (Significant Miss) |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66     | 0.17          | +0.49 (Significant Beat) |

Uber has consistently beaten earnings expectations in recent quarters, except for one significant miss. The recent substantial beat (Q1 2025) suggests strong growth, which could be a key driver of the share price.  However, past performance is not indicative of future results.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is growing steadily, and profit margins remain consistently high around 39%, indicating strong operational efficiency.

| Quarter | Revenue   | Profit Margin |

| 2024-12-31 | $11.96B  | 39.51%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $11.19B  | 39.57%       |

| 2023-12-31 | $9.94B   | 39.04%       |


**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has increased significantly in recent quarters, but ROE has fluctuated, suggesting some volatility in profitability.  The negative ROE in Q1 2024 is a concern.

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE      |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.56B  | 31.93%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78B  | 17.67%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.35B  | 8.22%    |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.06B  | -5.91%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $11.25B  | 12.70%   |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows strong recent revenue growth and high profit margins.  Earnings have mostly exceeded expectations, indicating positive momentum. However, the stock price has experienced significant volatility and the recent price drop is substantial.  The high beta suggests significant market risk. The negative expected return (-17.6%) and the considerable price drop (-3.13%) raise concerns. While long-term growth potential exists based on the recent earnings beats and revenue growth,  investors should carefully consider the volatility and the potential for further downside before investing, especially given the negative outlook for the short term. Further due diligence, including a thorough analysis of the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects, is recommended.
