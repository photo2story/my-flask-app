* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.95 – Positive value suggesting bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -4.3% – Indicates a recent slight weakening of relative strength.  Given the relatively small negative change and other positive indicators, this decline might represent a minor correction.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows signs of growth in revenue and relatively stable profit margins. However, the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been inconsistent and frequently negative.  High volatility, as evidenced by the beta values and large swings in EPS and ROE, represents a significant risk.  While recent earnings have been positive, the long-term projected underperformance (-35.1%) relative to the S&P 500 and consistently negative alpha values raise serious concerns.  Investors should carefully consider the substantial risk associated with this stock before investing, particularly given the significant underperformance projected relative to market benchmarks.  Further investigation into the drivers of earnings volatility is needed before making any investment decision.
