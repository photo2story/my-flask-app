## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a global ride-hailing and food delivery company.  The following analysis uses provided data to assess UBER's performance.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

UBER's cumulative return is 100.72%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 92.61% return. The difference is 8.1%, placing it at the 59.8th percentile of the historical range (-74.0% to 63.2%). While this suggests relatively strong performance, the relative percentile shows this outperformance is not extremely unusual within the historical context.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | 2.0% | 11.0% | -68.0% | -0.1 | 88.3 |
| 2020-2022  | -35.0% | 23.9% | -43.0% | -0.3 | 52.1 |
| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 23.9% | 1.0% | -1.0 | 129.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 56.0% | 23.9% | 24.0% | -1.0 | 127.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 112.0% | 15.5% | 50.0% | -1.1 | 167.2 |

**Analysis of Alpha and Beta:**  The negative alpha values across all periods indicate UBER has underperformed the market benchmark (likely a risk-adjusted market index) consistently over the analyzed periods.  The high beta values (generally above 1) suggest UBER's price is highly sensitive to market fluctuations, implying higher risk.  The fluctuating market capitalization suggests varying investor confidence. The improving CAGR and shrinking MDD in later periods suggest potential improvement in stability and performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $79.42
* **Previous Close:** $80.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $78.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $67.41

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent minor weakness.  However, it is significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend.  The day-to-day change shows a small decline (-1.08), which needs to be observed within a longer-term context.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (67.37):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally above 70), suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (1.69):** Positive value indicates a bullish trend, but needs consideration alongside other indicators.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+6.4):** Suggests recent short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (-16.8%):**  Indicates a negative expected return compared to S&P 500 over the long term. This contradicts the historical cumulative return comparison. More information is needed to reconcile this discrepancy.  The negative change in price from the previous close (-1.08) reflects a minor price dip, not a significant drop.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-05 | 3.21     | 0.5          | 2.71       |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2      | 0.41         | 0.79       |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47     | 0.31         | 0.16       |

| 2024-02-07 | 0.66     | 0.17         | 0.49       |

**Analysis:** Uber has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters, except in Q2 2024.  The significant positive difference between actual and expected EPS in Q1 2025 is noteworthy and should be investigated further for potential reasons.

**Analysis:** Revenue shows steady growth over the period, but there is slowing momentum. Profit margin remains relatively stable.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE       | Equity Growth |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $14.78     | 17.67%     | 19.8%          |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.35     | 8.22%      | 10.0%          |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.06     | -5.91%     | -1.7%          |
| 2023-12-31 | $11.25     | 12.70%     | 20.3%          |
| 2023-09-30 | $9.36      | 2.36%      | N/A             |

**Analysis:** Equity shows growth, although ROE fluctuates significantly suggesting inconsistencies in profitability related to invested capital.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows strong recent performance compared to the S&P 500, particularly over the past year or so (demonstrated by the high cumulative return and positive 20-day and 60-day moving averages).  However, its negative alpha values consistently reveal underperformance against a market benchmark, suggesting that its success may be more attributable to broader market trends and high risk rather than inherent company value outperformance. The recent increase in EPS significantly exceeds expectations, which is a positive indicator, but long-term sustained profitability must be observed to confirm this trend. Financial information reveals solid revenue growth but with some slowing momentum and fluctuating ROE. The slightly overbought RSI suggests potential short-term price corrections, while other indicators point towards a bullish trend in the longer term.  Further research and consideration of macroeconomic factors are advised before making any investment decisions. The large discrepancy between the historical cumulative returns and the projected negative expected return requires further investigation.
