2025-12-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of UBER based on the provided data, broken down into sections as requested:

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** UBER (Uber Technologies Inc)
*   **Company Overview:** Uber Technologies Inc. is a global technology company offering ride-hailing, food delivery, and other transportation services.
*   **Cumulative Return (UBER):** 31.58%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 77.19%
*   **Divergence:** -50.2 (Max: 21.6, Min: -64.2, Relative Divergence: 16.3)

**Analysis:**

*   UBER has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period reflected in the cumulative returns. The divergence of -50.2% indicates a substantial difference in returns. The relative divergence of 16.3 suggests that UBER's underperformance is closer to its worst historical underperformance relative to VOO than its best.

**Alpha/Beta Table Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -18.0% | 78.6% | -61.0% | 0.0   | 87.5   |
| 2020-2022  | -40.0% | 78.6% | -39.0% | 0.1   | 51.6   |
| 2021-2023  | -3.0%  | 77.8% | -4.0%  | -0.1  | 128.5  |
| 2022-2024  | 34.0%  | 77.8% | 13.0%  | -0.1  | 125.9  |
| 2023-2025  | 51.0%  | 77.8% | -14.0% | -0.3  | 187.9  |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate varies significantly across the periods. It was negative for the earlier periods (2019-2023) but turned positive and strong in the more recent ones (2022-2025).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high (around 78%), indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses during these periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, which measures the stock's risk-adjusted performance relative to the market, is mostly negative, suggesting underperformance relative to its risk. However, it turned positive in the 2022-2024 period. The last year is negative, but needs more confirmation.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are close to zero or slightly negative, suggesting that UBER's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market. This could mean that UBER is less sensitive to broad market trends than other stocks.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap is showing decent growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 90.013
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 90.1, Previous Close: 87.57, Change: 2.89
*   **5-day SMA:** 86.9733
*   **20-day SMA:** 89.6683
*   **60-day SMA:** 93.8945

**Analysis:**

*   The current price (90.013) is above the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it's still below the 60-day SMA, indicating that the longer-term trend might still be downward or at least not strongly bullish.
*   The recent price increase from 87.57 to 90.1 indicates a positive short-term movement.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.16
*   **PPO:** 0.0835
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.5 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -83.5 (long-term, >2 years, compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The **MRI of 0.9** suggests that the overall market conditions are favorable for investment, at least according to this particular indicator.
*   An **RSI of 40.16** suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold. Values below 30 often indicate oversold conditions (potential buy), while values above 70 indicate overbought conditions (potential sell).
*   A **PPO of 0.0835** is relatively low. The PPO measures the difference between two moving averages as a percentage of the longer moving average. This doesn't provide a strong signal in either direction on its own.
*   The **Hybrid Signal** is recommending buying.
*   The **recent relative divergence change of -3.5** indicates a short-term decline compared to the S&P 500.
*   The **Expected Return of -83.5%** is extremely negative. This suggests that, based on the model used, UBER is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term (more than 2 years) from this point.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Robotaxi Service Launch in Dallas:** Multiple news sources highlight the launch of Uber's robotaxi service in Dallas with a Waymo competitor, Avride.
*   **Analyst Price Target:** A new analyst forecast has given UBER a $125 price target.
*   **M&T Bank Corp Acquires Shares:** M&T Bank Corp acquired shares of Uber Technologies, Inc.
*   **Earnings Live:** Mentions but does not seem directly related to Uber
*   **Stock Titan:** Uber adds Avride autonomous robotaxis to Dallas rideshare network

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.57)
*   **Opinions:** 50
*   **Target Price:** Avg: $111.00 / High: $150.00 / Low: $82.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not specified

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Overall, the analysis presents a mixed picture for UBER:

*   **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** UBER has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the past, and the model predicts continued underperformance over the long term.
*   **Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate a high level of price volatility.
*   **Mixed Technical Signals:** The stock is trading above its short-term SMAs, suggesting a recent upward trend, but below its longer-term SMA. The RSI is neutral.
*   **Positive News Catalysts:** The launch of the robotaxi service in Dallas is a positive development and could be a future growth driver. Analyst price targets are significantly higher than the current price.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Despite the negative expected return, the analyst consensus is a "Buy" with an average target price significantly higher than the current price.
*   **Market Sentiment:** The MRI (Market Risk Indicator) of 0.9 suggests a generally favorable market environment for investment.

**In conclusion:**

UBER presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The company has strong growth potential (robotaxi service, analyst optimism), but also a history of underperformance and high volatility. The extremely negative expected return should be taken seriously, but it's important to consider that this is based on a specific model and may not reflect all potential future developments. Investors should weigh the potential upsides (innovative technology, analyst sentiment) against the risks (past underperformance, high volatility, negative expected return) before making a decision. The recent news around the robotaxi service is a potentially positive catalyst, but it's too early to tell if this will significantly impact the company's long-term performance.
