*   **Analysis:** Analysts are generally bullish on Uber, with a consensus "Buy" rating and a significantly higher average target price than the current price.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Uber's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. The alpha and beta analysis confirms this underperformance and volatility. While recent news is mixed, analyst opinions are generally positive, indicating that the market may believe in Uber's long-term potential.

Technically, the stock is oversold (RSI), but the price is below its 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a downtrend. The Market Risk Indicator suggests a high investment recommendation, but be wary as the other indicators indicate a negative trend. The expected return based on long-term trend comparison against the S&P 500 is very negative.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a mixed picture. While analysts and the MRI are bullish, the historical performance, technical indicators, and news headlines raise concerns. A potential investor should weigh the positive analyst sentiment against the company's underperformance, volatility, and the risks highlighted in the news.
