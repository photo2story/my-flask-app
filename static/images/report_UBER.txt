| 날짜       | EPS      | 예상 EPS | Surprise (%) |
|------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| 2025-05-07 | 0.83     | 0.508    | +63%          |

**5) Financial Information:**

The absence of total revenue and gross profit data prevents a complete financial health assessment.  This is a significant limitation to the analysis.  Further data is required for a comprehensive evaluation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

UBER has demonstrated strong recent performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this strong performance needs to be viewed with caution.  The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought.  Earnings demonstrate significant volatility, and the lack of key financial data limits the analysis. The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 also warrants consideration.  A more comprehensive financial analysis, including revenue and profit data, is needed for a robust investment decision.  The high beta suggests the stock is highly sensitive to broader market movements.  Investors should carefully weigh the risks associated with UBER's volatility before making investment decisions.
