*   **Analysis:**  The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed performance. While the CAGR has improved in recent periods (2022-2025), the large MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates significant volatility. The negative Alpha values in some periods suggest underperformance relative to the market, and the Beta values close to zero imply low correlation with the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Stock Price Trends:**

*   **Current Price:** \$94.08
*   **Last Market Data:** Price increased by \$0.73 from the previous close of \$93.4. (Slight rebound)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** \$95.83
*   **20-day Moving Average:** \$96.96
*   **60-day Moving Average:** \$93.91

*   **Analysis:** The price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but above the 60-day moving average. This suggests a potential short-term downward trend, although the recent price increase could signal a reversal.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.01 (Neutral - Neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.62 (Below zero, indicating a potential downtrend in price momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (Very Safe - MRI: 0.90) -  Suggests a strong buy signal according to this hybrid strategy.
*   **20-day Relative Performance Gap Change:** -4.2 (Negative trend in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return:** -36.0% (Projected underperformance vs. S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon)

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is neutral, but the negative PPO and recent decline in relative performance indicate some short-term weakness. The significantly negative expected return is a major concern, suggesting potential underperformance relative to the broader market. The Last Market Data showed the price increased by \$0.73 from the previous close of \$93.4. This might reflect a brief rebound after a possible price fluctuation.

**7. Overall Analysis & Conclusion:**

Uber presents a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:** Strong recent earnings performance, revenue growth, high profit margins, positive analyst consensus, and strategic investments in AI.
*   **Negatives:**  Underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high volatility (MDD), a negative expected return over the long term, increasing competition, and broader market risks. The recent performance is concerning given the expected return.

**Recommendation:**

Due to the negative expected return, potential investors should exercise caution, especially if considering a long-term investment. The buy signal is given from the Hybrid signal and medium MRI could signal for potential investment opportunity and it can be used for short-term investment, given that investors are aware of the recent underperformance compared to S&P 500. A more in-depth analysis, including a thorough review of Uber's competitive landscape, growth strategy, and risk factors, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
