* **5-Day Moving Average:** $65.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $62.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.82

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below its 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term bearish trend.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -32.9% (Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is projected over the long term).  This suggests that despite positive short-term momentum,  long-term investment may not yield substantial returns compared to the market benchmark.  The current price of $65.97 does not indicate a significant price jump or fall based on the provided information.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Uber has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters, which is a positive sign. However, the significant difference between actual and expected EPS in earlier quarters demonstrates some inconsistency.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|---------------|------------|
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2    | 0.41          | +0.79      |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47   | 0.31          | +0.16      |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32  | 0.2203        | -0.54       |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66   | 0.17          | +0.49      |
| 2023-11-07 | 0.1    | 0.12          | -0.02       |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is steadily increasing, with consistent and high profit margins.  This demonstrates financial health and strong operational efficiency.

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $11.19B    | 39.57%        |

**7. Summary:**

Uber shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, indicating a healthy core business.  However, the stock's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, with projections suggesting continued underperformance. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations,  the negative alpha and volatile ROE raise concerns about its future relative performance. The high RSI suggests potential short-term price corrections.  Investors considering a long-term position should carefully weigh the positive financial indicators against the projected underperformance relative to the market.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative ROE in Q1 2024 is recommended.
