**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, etc.**

|            | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -18.0%  | 78.6% | -61.0%  | 0.0    | 87.4   |

| 2022-2024  | 34.0%   | 77.8% | 13.0%   | -0.1   | 125.8  |
| 2023-2025  | 36.0%   | 77.8% | -27.0%  | -0.3   | 166.2  |

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating significantly, indicating volatile performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, suggesting substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Negative in most periods, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Generally close to zero or negative, meaning Uber's price movements have not been closely correlated with the S&P 500.  A negative beta suggests that the stock tends to move in the *opposite* direction of the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Uber's market capitalization has increased steadily over the past periods.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 79.69
*   **Last Market Change:** Price: 79.69, Previous Close: 79.14, Change: 0.69 (slight increase)
*   **5-day SMA:** 81.34
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.86
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.79

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term, mid-term, and long-term downward trend. The 5-day SMA is closest to the current price, indicating potential for a near-term rebound if upward momentum builds.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment).
*   **RSI:** 32.12 (approaching oversold territory - below 30 usually indicates oversold conditions)
*   **PPO:** -0.97 (Negative, indicates bearish trend, and the price may be declining.)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** 90% Buy (Based on safe MRI:0.80 conditions. It recommends investing 90% of available cash.)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -12.4 (Indicates short-term decline).
*   **Expected Return:** -214.8% (Very negative, suggests significant underperformance compared to S&P 500 if held long-term).

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment risk.
*   The RSI indicates the stock may be oversold, presenting a potential buying opportunity for some investors.
*   The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag and warrants careful consideration.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Headlines:** Several recent news items are concerning:
    *   Regulatory scrutiny over billing and cancellation tactics.
    *   FTC lawsuit expanding regarding Uber One practices.
    *   Continued stock slide attributed to weakness.
*   **Mixed/Positive Headlines:**
    *   An article suggesting the stock is historically cheap and a long-term compounder at a bargain.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.54)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 111.96 / High: 150.00 / Low: 84.00

**Analysis:**

*   Despite the negative news and poor recent performance, analysts generally have a "Buy" rating with a significant upside potential based on target prices. This disparity between analyst sentiment and market behavior warrants further investigation.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Negative Short-Term Performance:** UBER has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and recent price action is trending downwards, with the stock price below key moving averages.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While technical indicators like RSI suggest the stock may be oversold and ripe for a rebound, the extremely negative expected return paints a bleak picture for long-term investors.
*   **Conflicting Narratives:** The news headlines present a mixed bag, with negative reports about regulatory issues and stock weakness counterbalanced by articles suggesting the stock is undervalued. Analyst consensus leans towards "Buy," further complicating the picture.
*   **Risk Factors:** The high maximum drawdowns and fluctuating CAGR highlight the stock's inherent volatility. Regulatory risks and competitive pressures (as hinted at in the news about robotaxis) could further impact performance.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in UBER at this juncture presents a high degree of uncertainty. The negative news, poor recent performance, and extremely negative expected return should give investors pause. However, the oversold RSI, analyst buy ratings, and the potential for a turnaround (as suggested by some news articles) could be attractive to risk-tolerant investors. **A potential investor should conduct thorough due diligence, carefully weigh the risks and rewards, and consider their investment horizon before making a decision.** The significant divergence from the S&P 500 indicates a high-risk, high-reward scenario.
