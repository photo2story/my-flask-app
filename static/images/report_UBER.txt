**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Uber's cumulative return (42.64%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's return (26.37%) over the analyzed period. The difference of 16.3% places Uber's performance in the 69.8th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on the provided range (max 46.6%, min -53.7%). This suggests strong relative performance, though past performance is not indicative of future results.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | -5.0% | 63.6% | -0.0 | 87.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -34.0% | 68.7% | 0.1 | 51.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 13.0% | 70.5% | 0.0 | 128.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 43.0% | 72.6% | -0.1 | 126.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 58.0% | 83.5% | 0.7 | 152.0 |

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows fluctuating performance, with significant improvement in recent years. The high Beta values (especially in the earlier periods) indicate high sensitivity to market movements. Alpha values are generally close to zero, suggesting performance is largely in line with market expectations, except for 2023-2025 where a positive alpha suggests outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $72.68
* **5-day moving average:** $67.57
* **20-day moving average:** $72.03
* **60-day moving average:** $72.52

The price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively stable trend.  The significant daily change (Last-market: +11.7%) indicates a recent sharp price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 47.03 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.82 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -7.4% (This is negative, suggesting that, currently the model predicts an underperformance in the short-term.)

The high MRI and negative PPO suggest caution.  The recent sharp price increase (11.7%) warrants further investigation to determine its sustainability.  The negative expected return is a short term prediction.  The report suggests that a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy could yield returns exceeding the S&P 500.

The high Beta indicates sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent price surge and the Q1 2024 ROE is recommended before making investment decisions.
