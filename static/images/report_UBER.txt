## Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Uber Technologies Inc. is a transportation network company providing ride-sharing and food delivery services.

Over the period analyzed, UBER's cumulative return (71.21%) lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (89.14%).  The difference is -17.9%, placing it at the 40.9th percentile of the historical range of differences between UBER and VOO performance.  This indicates that UBER's underperformance relative to the market is not exceptionally unusual, given the historical context.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows negative alpha consistently across the analyzed periods, indicating that UBER has underperformed the market (as reflected by the S&P 500), after adjusting for market risk (Beta).  The beta consistently around -0.1 suggests a low or negative correlation with the market, meaning its price movements are not strongly influenced by overall market trends. The high CAGR in 2023-2025 should be viewed cautiously, since it is a projection.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $67.34
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $66.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $63.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.63

The price is below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend. However, it's above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating some short-term support.  The recent price change shows a decrease of $1.81 from the previous close, hinting at short-term bearish pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (68.29):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but approaching overbought territory.
* **PPO (1.30):**  A positive value suggests a bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-2.0):** Shows a recent short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return (-34.9%):**  This suggests that, based on current projections, long-term investment (2+ years) in UBER may underperform the S&P 500 considerably.  This needs significant caution; such a low expected return warrants careful consideration of the risk-reward tradeoff.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters (except for Q2 2024), indicating positive performance relative to analyst forecasts.  However, the significant positive surprise in Q4 2024 needs to be considered in light of the overall trend and future projections.

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Surprise |
|------------|---------|--------------|----------|
| 2024-10-31 | 1.2     | 0.41          | +1.92    |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.47    | 0.31          | +0.16    |
| 2024-05-08 | -0.32   | 0.2203        | -0.54    |
| 2024-02-07 | 0.66    | 0.17          | +0.49    |
| 2023-11-07 | 0.1     | 0.12          | -0.02    |

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent growth, and profit margins remain high and stable around 39%, suggesting good profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** While revenue is consistently growing, equity shows some volatility, and Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates significantly, indicating potential instability in profitability and utilization of capital.  Negative ROE in Q1 2024 is a significant concern.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

UBER shows mixed signals. While revenue and profit margins are strong and EPS has consistently beat expectations (except for one quarter), its stock performance significantly lags the S&P 500.  The negative alpha, low beta, and a significantly negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 raise concerns.  The high variability in ROE also points to risks. Further analysis, including a deep dive into the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors, is needed before forming a conclusive investment opinion.  The exceptionally high EPS beat in Q4 2024 warrants investigation to determine its sustainability. The current price is below its 60-day moving average, showing potential downward pressure.  Investing requires carefully weighing the positive aspects of revenue growth and profitability against the substantial risk of underperformance relative to the market, particularly given the projections of a negative long-term expected return.
