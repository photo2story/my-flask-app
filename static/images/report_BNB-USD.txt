*   **VOO (S&P 500):** Cumulative Return = 79.56%
*   **Divergence:** Current = 2059.4 (Relative Divergence = 64.6)

*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is also highly variable, reflecting periods where BNB-USD either vastly outperforms or underperforms its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is close to 0 or less than 0, suggesting that BNB-USD's price is not highly correlated with the overall market (or even inversely correlated, at times), which can be caused by regulatory impacts or changes in the popularity of blockchain technology and crypto currencies.
