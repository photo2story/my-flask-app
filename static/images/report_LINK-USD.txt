*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment). This suggests a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 32.65.  This is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, but further confirmation is needed.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.96. This indicates bearish price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_70%_Sell 70.0% of holdings (32513 shares - Caution - MRI:0.50). This strong sell signal suggests high caution is warranted.

*   **Expected Return (%):** 6331.9%.  This is a very high projected long-term (2+ years) excess return compared to the S&P 500, but should be viewed with extreme skepticism.

**Analysis:** The combination of RSI near oversold, bearish PPO, and a strong sell signal suggests a cautious approach is warranted. The recent decline in relative deviation further reinforces the short-term negative outlook. The extremely high expected return should be treated with significant caution.
