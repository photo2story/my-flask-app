**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha     | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| 2017-2019  | 276.0%   | 80.5%   | 268.0%    | -0.0   | 1.2    |

| 2020-2022  | 218.0%   | 85.4%   | 218.0%    | 0.0    | 3.9    |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:**  While historical CAGRs (Compound Annual Growth Rates) were extremely high in 2018-2021, recent periods (2021-2025) have seen significant negative returns.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown remains high, showing significant risk of price declines.
    *   **Alpha:** The Alpha is very high (positive) in earlier periods, indicating outperformance relative to the benchmark, but then becomes very negative recently, showing underperformance. The Alpha is the value that this cryptocurrency produces independently and is the return from active management (or lack of it).
    *   **Beta:** Beta is generally low, hovering around zero. Beta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta near zero indicates that Chainlink stock movement is very much not correlated with the movement of the S\&P500 index.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 12.70
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 12.70, Previous Close: 12.93, Change: -1.83%
*   **5-day SMA:** 13.11
*   **20-day SMA:** 13.48
*   **60-day SMA:** 14.85

*   **Analysis:** The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, reinforcing this bearish signal.  The negative change in the last market data further confirms recent downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 31.87 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.24
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (82 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 8665.5%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:**  The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI is below 30, indicating that Chainlink is currently oversold. This *could* signal a potential buying opportunity as it may be undervalued.
    *   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests a downtrend in momentum, although this value is very low, it confirms the value expressed by the other data here.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal recommends buying with 100% of available cash, judging this as very safe, which may seem contradictory to the other indicators. This could be based on a longer-term investment horizon.
    *   **Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend.
    *   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return suggests significant potential upside, but must be viewed with extreme caution. This could be based on overly optimistic models and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.

    *   Extremely high expected return (though highly speculative).

*   **Negatives:**
    *   Recent negative price action (price below moving averages).
    *   Negative recent CAGR, alpha values

    *   Mixed news sentiment (price declines, selling pressure).
    *   Extremely high expected return is likely unrealistic.

*   **Conclusion:** Chainlink presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.

The news flow is mixed, and the extremely high expected return should be treated with skepticism.  The investor should perform much more investigation to have a complete picture of the investment's risk. Before investing, consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Further research is crucial, and it's wise to diversify your portfolio rather than relying solely on a single cryptocurrency.
