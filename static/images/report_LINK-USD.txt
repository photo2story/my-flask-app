*   **Negatives:** Recent performance has been weak, with price below moving averages and a negative change in relative spread. The high MDD and wild swings in CAGR suggest very high volatility and significant risk. The recent price decrease highlights current negative pressure.

*   **Consider a small allocation if you are a long-term investor with a high-risk tolerance.** The high expected return is enticing, but the volatility is extreme.
*   **Monitor price action closely.** Watch for a sustained break above the 20-day moving average as a potential bullish signal.
*   **Set stop-loss orders to manage risk.** The high MDD suggests that substantial drawdowns are possible.
