*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows extremely high growth in the 2018-2021 period, followed by significant negative returns in 2021-2024. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a positive, but more modest, growth rate.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown remains high across all periods, indicating substantial volatility and risk.

*   **Beta:** Beta values are very close to zero, indicating very low systematic risk (correlation to the market). This is surprising, given the volatile price action of Chainlink. The recent increase to Beta of 0.2 may suggest increasing integration and volatility with the market.

*   The high MDD values indicate it's a high-risk, high-reward investment.
