## Chainlink (LINK-USD) Analysis

### 1.  Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **Ticker:** LINK-USD
*   **Company Overview:** Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts on blockchain networks.

**Key Metrics:**

*   **LINK Cumulative Return:** 549.32%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 77.67%
*   **Absolute Divergence (LINK - VOO):** 498.5

**Analysis:**

Chainlink has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.
