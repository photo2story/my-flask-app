**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD    | Alpha     | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|

| 2018-2020  | 1519.0%   | 80.5%  | 1495.0%   | -0.0   | 7.8    |
| 2019-2021  | 1800.0%   | 80.5%  | 1754.0%   | 0.0    | 13.7   |
| 2020-2022  | 218.0%    | 85.4%  | 218.0%    | 0.0    | 3.9    |

| 2023-2025  | -392.0%   | 80.9%  | -450.0%   | 0.2    | 8.2    |

**Analysis of Table:**

*   **CAGR:** Shows extremely high growth in earlier periods (2018-2021), followed by significant negative returns in recent years (2021-2025).  This indicates high volatility and speculative interest.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values (around 80-85%) indicate substantial risk and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values largely mirror the CAGR, indicating that Chainlink's performance is primarily driven by its own idiosyncratic factors rather than market-wide movements.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to 0 suggests Chainlink's price is not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). The beta value of 0.2 in 2023-2025 shows a slightly positive correlation.
*   **Cap(B):** Represents Market capitalization in Billions of dollars.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** $11.77
*   **Previous Close:** $12.12
*   **Change:** -2.87% (Decrease from previous day)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 12.83
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 14.57
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 17.99

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a potential downtrend. The negative change from the previous close further reinforces this short-term bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 19.87 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.52
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-01)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -2.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 8978.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A "Medium Investment" rating suggests a moderate level of risk based on the MRI's criteria.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 19.87 indicates that Chainlink is currently oversold, which *could* suggest a potential for a price rebound (but doesn't guarantee it).
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO supports the short-term decline
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** The negative value confirms a recent downward trend relative to its historical performance compared to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (8978.7%) is highly speculative. This suggests a potential long-term overperformance compared to the S\&P 500, but is also extremely sensitive to market conditions.

**The price decrease of -2.87%:** This relatively small change does not necessarily suggest a significant volatility event.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

The provided news headlines are *not directly related to Chainlink*. They cover broader market trends, predictions for other stocks (SNAP, PSNY, Uber), and consumer-related articles.  Therefore, they have limited direct impact on a fundamental analysis of Chainlink itself.

**5. Overall Summary and Analysis:**

*   **Performance:** Chainlink has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, but its recent performance has been volatile, with substantial drawdowns.
*   **Technicals:** Technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend, with the price below key moving averages and an oversold RSI. The PPO and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence confirm this.
*   **Risk:**  The high MDD and volatile CAGR highlight the inherent risk associated with Chainlink.
*   **News:** The provided news is irrelevant for Chainlink
*   **Investment Decision:** The Hybrid Signal suggests a potential buying opportunity, but the suggestion is not consistent with other negative short term trends.
*   **Future:** The extremely high expected return is a speculative projection that should be regarded with caution.

Chainlink presents a mixed picture. While its historical outperformance is undeniable, recent performance has been poor, and technical indicators suggest further short-term weakness. The provided news headlines are irrelevant. The extremely high expected return is speculative and should be regarded with caution.
