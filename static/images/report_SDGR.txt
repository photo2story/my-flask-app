Over the period analyzed, SDGR significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of -46.68% compared to VOO's 26.39%.  The difference represents a substantial underperformance of -73.07%.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently negative alpha values across the analyzed periods, indicating SDGR's underperformance relative to the market (beta consistently above 1 suggests higher volatility than the market).

Note that while 2022-2024 shows positive CAGR, the previous years show significantly negative returns, impacting the overall picture.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -73.0% | 69.2% | -106.0% | 0.1 | 1.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -71.0% | 69.2% | -99.0% | -0.1 | 2.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 12.0% | 72.4% | -4.0% | -0.2 | 1.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 5.0% | 73.6% | -0.5 | 1.3 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of SDGR ($18.03) is below all three moving averages (5-day: $19.07, 20-day: $21.15, 60-day: $22.37), suggesting a downward trend. The significant negative change from the previous close (-4.45) indicates a sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI (20.56) is well below 30, suggesting the stock is oversold.  The negative PPO (-1.60) further confirms the bearish sentiment.  The recent increase in relative divergence (+7.6) suggests a short-term upward bounce, but this is countered by the overall negative trend and other indicators.  The MRI of 0.46 suggests high risk.  The expected return of -293.8% over the long term strongly indicates that SDGR is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.  This drastic negative return warrants extreme caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company shows consistent negative EPS throughout the provided timeframe, indicating ongoing losses. Revenue is relatively stable, but low compared to the negative profit margin.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-12 | -0.52 | 0.04 B$ |
| 2024-07-31 | -0.74 | 0.05 B$ |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.76 | 0.04 B$ |
| 2023-11-01 | -0.86 | 0.04 B$ |
| 2024-11-12 | -0.86 | 0.04 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Profit margins show some variability, but are generally high, possibly indicating pricing power or cost-cutting measures.  However, this is largely irrelevant given the significant negative ROE, consistently indicating that the company is not generating returns on its equity. This is a major red flag.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B | 72.61% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) presents a highly risky investment.  The stock is significantly underperforming the market, showing consistent negative alpha, high volatility, and a substantial maximum drawdown.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the negative earnings, consistently negative ROE, and a drastically negative long-term expected return paint a bleak picture.  While the high profit margins are noteworthy, they are overshadowed by the persistent losses and poor return on equity.  Investing in SDGR at this time carries substantial risk and should only be considered by investors with a high tolerance for loss and a thorough understanding of the company's specific challenges and prospects for turnaround.  The projected long-term underperformance against the S&P 500 strongly advises against investment.
