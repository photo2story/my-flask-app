The price is currently above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B | 72.61%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.04B | 50.24%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.05B | 66.20%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.04B | 51.61%       |

| 2024-12-31 | $0.42B | -9.54%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.45B | -8.49%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.47B | -11.40% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.51B | -10.65% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B | -5.59%  |

Revenue shows some increase in Q4 2024, but profit margins fluctuate.  Critically, the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating profits from its invested capital. This is a major concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Schrodinger (SDGR) presents a high-risk investment.  While the recent price action shows some short-term upward momentum, the underlying fundamentals are weak.  Consistently negative EPS, negative ROE, and a significantly negative expected return paint a concerning picture.  The overbought RSI suggests a potential correction is imminent.  The high beta indicates considerable market sensitivity.  Unless the company can demonstrate a significant turnaround in its profitability and demonstrate sustainable revenue growth, the long-term outlook remains bearish.  The provided -238.4% expected return requires clarification as it seems exceptionally low and warrants further investigation into its calculation method.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution.
