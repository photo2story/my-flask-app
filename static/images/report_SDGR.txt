Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) based on the data provided.

**Report on Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR)**

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Schrodinger Inc. is a company specializing in computational chemistry and materials science software.

*   **Performance:**
    *   SDGR Cumulative Return: -57.11%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 67.25%
    *   Divergence:
        *   Current: -123.2
        *   Relative Divergence: 2.3

*   **Analysis:** SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. The divergence is quite large and negative, and the relative divergence suggests that SDGR's underperformance is near its worst levels relative to its historical range. This suggests the company is experiencing a difficult moment relative to the overall market.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
    |------------|----------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
    | 2020-2022  | -70.0%   | 78.2% | -76.0%   | 0.0    | 1.4    |
    | 2021-2023  | -57.0%   | 81.0% | -59.0%   | -0.0   | 2.6    |
    | 2022-2024  | 6.0%    | 81.0% | -14.0%   | -0.0   | 1.4    |
    | 2023-2025  | -5.0%   | 82.6% | -69.0%   | -0.0   | 1.3    |

    **Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis paints a concerning picture.

    *   **CAGR:** Consistently negative CAGR values indicate poor overall growth during the given periods.
    *   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values point to significant volatility and potential for substantial losses.
    *   **Alpha:** The consistently negative Alpha values suggest that SDGR underperforms relative to its benchmark, even considering market risk.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values close to zero suggest that SDGR is relatively uncorrelated to the broader market (S&P 500). This means its performance is driven more by company-specific factors than overall market movements.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** $17.20
*   **Last Market Activity:** Price decreased by 1.15% from the previous close of $17.40.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: $17.76
    *   20-day SMA: $17.51
    *   60-day SMA: $19.06

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), which generally suggests a short-term and potentially intermediate-term downtrend. The recent price decrease of 1.15% also contributes to this negative sentiment.

**3) Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 43.92
*   **PPO:** 0.3968
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 1.0 (Positive - indicating a short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2764.5

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:** A Market Risk Indicator of 0.7 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, but this should be considered alongside other factors.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 43.92 is below 50 and could suggest that the stock is not overbought.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO being close to zero indicates that the short-term and long-term moving averages are close to each other, suggesting a period of consolidation.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal suggests a "Buy" recommendation, seeing it as a "Very Safe" investment with a high MRI of 0.90.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The positive divergence indicates a short-term upward trend, potentially a bounce from lower levels.
    *   **Expected Return:** A massive negative expected return of -2764.5% is alarming and indicates a severe projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500. This should be a major point of concern.

*   **Analysis:** The news headlines present a mixed picture. While some sources suggest potential value ("Unlocking Hidden Value," "Buy the Bottom") and upgrades from analysts (B of A Securities), the consensus rating remains "Hold." The new analyst forecast of $24 suggests potential upside from the current price, but this is just one data point.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:**
    *   Rating: Strong Buy
    *   Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell): 1.44 (~Strong Buy)
    *   Opinions: 9
    *   Target Price (avg/high/low): 27.22 / 33.00 / 18.00

*   **Analysis:** Analyst consensus seems optimistic, with a rating close to "Strong Buy" and an average target price of $27.22, significantly higher than the current price. However, the "Hold" consensus from other brokerages contradicts this. The low target price of $18.00 shows that analysts have a wide range of opinions on the stock.

|--------------|---------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.32B  | -10.21%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.34B  | -12.59%   |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.45B  | -8.49%    |

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **Revenue:** Revenue has fluctuated but is generally in the $40-$60 million range per quarter.
    *   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins appear relatively high (around 50-70%), which is positive. This suggests that the company is efficient in controlling its costs related to the revenue it generates. However, despite the high profit margins, the company is still not profitable overall (as evidenced by the negative EPS).
    *   **Equity:** Equity has been decreasing, indicating the company is using its assets faster than it is generating profits.
    *   **ROE:** Consistently negative Return on Equity (ROE) further emphasizes the company's lack of profitability and inefficient use of shareholder equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) presents a mixed and concerning investment picture:

*   **Poor Performance:** SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Financials:** Consistent losses, decreasing equity, and negative ROE are serious red flags. While the profit margins are high, they do not translate into overall profitability.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Analyst opinions are divided, with some "Strong Buy" recommendations countered by a general "Hold" consensus. News headlines offer some optimism but require careful scrutiny.
*   **Technicals:** Stock price below moving averages indicates a downtrend.
*   **Very High Risk:** The extraordinarily negative expected return overshadows any potential positives.

**Conclusion:** Based on this data, SDGR appears to be a very risky investment. While some analysts see potential upside, the company's financial performance and negative expected return warrant extreme caution. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and conduct thorough due diligence before considering an investment in SDGR.
