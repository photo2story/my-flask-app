*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is significantly negative, meaning SDGR has consistently underperformed relative to its benchmark (market return).
*   **Beta:** Beta hovering around zero indicates that the stock price does not fluctuate much with the market (S&P 500). A beta of 0 is a major red flag and may require further analysis.

*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative recent divergence change indicates that the recent rally is not sustained.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative "Expected Return" is concerning, hinting at potential model issues or reflecting a deeply pessimistic outlook based on the current data. This is probably not a realistic number and indicates a flaw in the model's calculation. This number should be treated with extreme skepticism.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출    |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 2025-11-05 | -0.45 | 0.05 B$ |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.59 | 0.05 B$ |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.82 | 0.06 B$ |
| 2024-11-12 | -0.52 | 0.04 B$ |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.52 | 0.04 B$ |

**Analysis:**  The company is consistently reporting negative EPS (Earnings Per Share), indicating it is not currently profitable. Revenue is relatively stable, but not enough to offset expenses. The decreasing EPS from 2024-11-12 through 2025-05-07 (from -0.52 to -0.82) should be alarming, however the most recent EPS is -0.45, showing improvement.

**6. Financial Information (Revenue, Profitability, Capital):**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.05B  | 51.61%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.05B  | 47.77%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.06B  | 52.26%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B  | 72.61%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.04B  | 50.24%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE      |
|------------|----------|----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.32B   | -10.21%  |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.34B   | -12.59%  |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.37B   | -16.01%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.42B   | -9.54%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.45B   | -8.49%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue is inconsistent quarter to quarter, with a spike in Q4 2024.
*   **Profit Margin:**  Profit margins are high, indicating good efficiency in converting revenue to profit *when* revenue is present. The overall profitability is offset by the net loss reported in the EPS data.
*   **Equity:** Equity is decreasing over time, which is a concern, especially paired with the negative ROE.
*   **ROE:**  Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not effectively using investor equity to generate profits.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Fundamentals:** SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, has negative and decreasing returns on equity, and reports consistent losses. The company is burning equity over time, not generating returns.
*   **Potential Positive Catalysts:** Recent analyst upgrades, a price target increase, and Cathie Wood's investment have triggered a recent price increase. The news and analyst sentiment suggest a belief in the company's potential, particularly related to its software pivot.
*   **Concerning Indicators:** The "Expected Return" is incredibly negative, which should be further investigated. This number is so extreme that it is not realistic.
*   **Moving Forward:** While news is positive, investors should be aware that the company currently has negative earnings, and should consider the recent good news to be potentially short term. More investigation into revenue growth is likely needed.

**Conclusion:**

SDGR appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment. The fundamental financial data is weak. However, positive analyst sentiment and the strategic pivot to software could potentially drive future growth. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards, consider the negative fundamentals, and do further due diligence before investing. The potential for a short term gain is there, but the long term prospect of the company is in question.
