**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing data is a significant limitation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500,  consistently reporting negative earnings and revenue stagnation. While recent price action shows a slight upward trend,  the technical indicators and fundamental analysis suggest a high-risk investment.  The extremely negative expected return (-317.9%) needs clarification and potential error investigation.  The missing financial data further hampers a complete assessment.  Based on the available data, SDGR is not recommended as an investment at this time.  Further investigation into the company's business model, future prospects, and the accuracy of the provided expected return figure is crucial before making any investment decision.
