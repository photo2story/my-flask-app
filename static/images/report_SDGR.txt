**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|-------|--------|

*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to a benchmark, even after accounting for market risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to 0.0 indicate that stock price is not that correlated to market movements.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 17.66
*   **Previous Close:** 17.2
*   **Change:** 2.67%
*   **5-day SMA:** 17.68
*   **20-day SMA:** 17.57
*   **60-day SMA:** 19.04

*   **Analysis:** The current price is above both the 5-day and 20-day SMA, but remains below the 60-day SMA. The positive change from the previous close suggests a recent upward trend.  The fact that the 5-day SMA is slightly above the 20-day SMA further reinforces this short-term upward momentum. However, the current price being below the 60-day SMA suggests the stock is still in a longer term downtrend, or recovery phase.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 59.66
*   **PPO:** 0.38
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI: 0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** 1.0 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2764.5%
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   An RSI of 59.66 indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
    *   PPO of 0.38 is a positive value, suggesting that the 12-day EMA is above the 26-day EMA, which could indicate a short-term upward trend.
    *   The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy recommendation.
    *   The positive change in relative divergence further supports a short-term upward trend.
    *   The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. It suggests that, based on current data, long-term investment in SDGR is projected to result in significant losses compared to the S&P 500. This needs careful consideration and further investigation.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in SDGR is speculative at this time. The company's financial performance is weak, and it has significantly underperformed the market.

The negative expected return should be heavily weighted against any potential investment. Investors considering SDGR should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards, conduct thorough due diligence, and monitor the company's financial performance and news flow closely. Any investment should be considered high-risk.
