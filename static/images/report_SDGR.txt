*   **Analysis:** SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The relative divergence of -85.8 indicates a substantial negative gap in cumulative returns compared to VOO.  The relative position of 7.3 suggests that this underperformance is near its worst levels within the analyzed historical data range.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0% | 68.9%  | -92.0%  | -0.0   | 1.4    |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0% | 68.9%  | -82.0%  | -0.0   | 2.6    |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0%   | 72.4%  | -8.0%   | -0.0   | 1.4    |
| 2023-2025  | 6.0%   | 74.2%  | -24.0%  | -0.1   | 1.6    |

*   **Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:** The table reveals several concerning trends. The negative CAGRs for 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlight significant value destruction over those periods. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures are very high, indicating substantial risk and volatility. The Alpha values are consistently negative, indicating that SDGR has significantly underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. The Beta values are near zero, suggesting that SDGR's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). The company's market capitalization (Cap) is relatively small.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Key Numbers:**
    *   Current Price: $21.52
    *   Previous Close: $21.50
    *   Change: $0.09
    *   5-Day Moving Average: $21.23
    *   20-Day Moving Average: $23.34
    *   60-Day Moving Average: $22.65

*   **Analysis:** The small increase today (change of $0.09) doesn't necessarily indicate a significant shift. The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend in the short to medium term. The fact that the 5-day moving average is below the current price indicates a very recent, slight upward momentum, but it's weak.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Key Numbers:**
    *   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.366 (Low Risk)
    *   RSI: 31.29 (Oversold)
    *   PPO: -1.51
    *   Hybrid Signal: Cash_69%_Sell 0.7% of holdings (3 shares - Caution - MRI:0.35)
    *   20-Day Relative Divergence Change: +1.0 (Short-term Increase)
    *   Expected Return: -722.6%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI indicates a low-risk environment, but this needs to be considered in context with the company's overall performance.
    *   The RSI of 31.29 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, which *could* indicate a potential for a bounce, but doesn't guarantee it.
    *   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is negative, indicating a bearish trend.
    *   The hybrid signal is suggesting to SELL a very small amount of holdings and hold a high cash position, reflecting caution.
    *   The recent 20-day relative divergence change is positive, suggesting a short-term upward trend in relative performance, but it is not enough to offset the overall negative divergence.
    *   **The extremely negative expected return (-722.6%) is a major red flag.** This indicates a very pessimistic outlook for SDGR's long-term performance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   The minimal price change today indicates no significant volatility or market reaction.
