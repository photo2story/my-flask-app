2025-12-31 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the data provided for Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR), followed by a comprehensive analysis:

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** SDGR
*   **Company Overview:** Schrodinger Inc. is a company that develops software for drug discovery and materials science.
*   **SDGR Cumulative Return:** -55.61%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 70.37%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -125.7
    *   Relative Divergence: 0.8 (meaning it's near the low end of its divergence range compared to VOO over the observed period).

**Analysis:** SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The relative divergence being near its minimum suggests this underperformance is near its worst level relative to the comparison period.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -70.0%  | 78.2%  | -76.0%  | 0.0     | 1.4    |
| 2021-2023  | -57.0%  | 81.0%  | -59.0%  | -0.0    | 2.6    |
| 2022-2024  | 6.0%    | 81.0%  | -14.0%  | -0.0    | 1.4    |
| 2023-2025  | -4.0%   | 82.6%  | -71.0%  | -0.0    | 1.3    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is negative in most periods, indicating poor average annual returns.  The 2022-2024 period shows a positive CAGR, but it's relatively small.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high (above 78%), highlighting significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha values suggest that SDGR is underperforming relative to its risk-adjusted expected return. In simpler terms, it's not generating the returns you'd expect given its risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta near 0. This is hard to believe, but we must admit that it is not very volatile compared to the market as a whole.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap is at 1.3B.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 17.80
*   **Last-market:** Price: 17.8, Previous Close: 17.84, Change: -0.22%
*   **5-day SMA:** 18.23
*   **20-day SMA:** 17.95
*   **60-day SMA:** 18.84

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently trading slightly below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but significantly below its 60-day moving average. This could suggest a short-term downtrend, but the difference is small. The recent small negative change suggests only slight downward pressure on the stock.

**3. Indicators Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.28 (Neutral - Neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.32 (Close to 0, a positive value indicates the short term moving average is higher than the long term moving average)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)" - This signal, based on the MRI, suggests a strong buy signal, and a monthly investment.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -6562.1 - Extremely negative, indicating high risk and projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a longer investment horizon.

**Analysis:**  The MRI suggests a medium level of risk and recommends investment. However, the very negative expected return is alarming and contradicts the MRI signal. The Hybrid Signal's "Buy" recommendation should be viewed with extreme skepticism. The short-term decline in relative divergence supports the recent price movement.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **[2025-11-10] "Buy the Bottom" articles:**  Suggesting potential value or a turning point, but should be evaluated cautiously.
*   **[2025-08-21] "Complex Story" article:** Highlights the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the company.
*   **[2025-10-20] Price increase:** A 14% increase is a positive sign, but it's important to understand the underlying reasons and sustainability.
*   **[2025-10-30] Milestone:** Positive news regarding collaborations and achievements.
*   **[2025-12-15] Analyst Upgrade:** Positive news.

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. There are some potentially positive signals (analyst upgrade, milestones, "buy the bottom" mentions), but also cautions about the complexity of the company's story.  The "buy the bottom" articles might be attempts to capitalize on the stock's decline, so thorough due diligence is crucial.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Mean:** Not specified.
*   **Opinions:** 9
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 27.22 / 33.00 / 18.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not specified.

**Analysis:** The average target price of $27.22 suggests a potential upside from the current price of $17.8. However, the range is wide, indicating uncertainty among analysts.  The lack of information on recent rating changes makes it difficult to gauge the current sentiment of analysts.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출         |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -0.45   | 0.05 B$      |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.59   | 0.05 B$      |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.82   | 0.06 B$      |
| 2024-11-12 | -0.52   | 0.04 B$      |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.52   | 0.04 B$      |

**Analysis:** The company is consistently reporting negative EPS (Earnings Per Share), indicating unprofitability. Revenue is relatively stable, but not high enough to offset expenses. The trend in EPS appears to be worsening until recently, but we need more than 5 quarters to be sure.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.05B    | 51.61%         |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.05B    | 47.77%         |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.06B    | 52.26%         |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.09B    | 72.61%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.04B    | 50.24%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE         |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.32B    | -10.21%     |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.34B    | -12.59%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.37B    | -16.01%     |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.42B    | -9.54%      |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.45B    | -8.49%      |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue is fluctuating but has been fairly consistent in the recent quarters.
*   **Profit Margin:** The profit margins look strong, but it should be noticed that net income is still negative, which means there are fixed costs that are higher than the gross profit.
*   **Equity:** Equity is decreasing over the period. This could be due to losses or share buybacks, but in the absence of profit it is most likely due to negative profits.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating profits from its shareholders' investments.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Performance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and its historical CAGR has been poor. The negative Alpha suggests it's not providing risk-adjusted returns.
*   **Risk:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate substantial volatility.
*   **Financials:** The company is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE. While revenue is relatively stable and profit margins are high, equity is decreasing.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The MRI suggests a medium investment risk, but the extremely negative expected return contradicts this. The Hybrid Signal's buy recommendation seems highly questionable.
*   **News:** News coverage is mixed, with positive headlines balanced by cautions about the company's complexity. Analyst target prices suggest potential upside, but there's a wide range of opinions.
* **Conclusion:** Based on the data provided, investing in SDGR appears risky. The consistent unprofitability, negative expected return, and substantial underperformance compared to the market raise significant concerns. While there are some potentially positive signals (analyst target prices, news headlines), they are not strong enough to outweigh the negative factors. **Caution is strongly advised.** Further due diligence, including a deep dive into the company's financials, business model, and future prospects, is essential before making any investment decision. The MRI's "medium investment" rating should be disregarded in light of the other more compelling negative indicators.
