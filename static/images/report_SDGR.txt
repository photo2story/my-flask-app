**6) Overall Analysis:**

SDGR shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, with consistently negative EPS and ROE. While recent revenue has shown some increase and profit margins are high,  the negative EPS and significant losses over several years raise serious concerns.  The recent sharp price increase needs further investigation to determine its sustainability. The extremely negative expected return (-208.2%) strongly suggests significant risk.  Based on this data,  SDGR is currently a high-risk investment with limited evidence of positive long-term potential, especially given the negative alpha.  Further investigation into the reasons for the high profit margin despite negative EPS and the cause of the recent large price increase is crucial before considering any investment.
