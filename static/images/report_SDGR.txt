Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of SDGR (Schrodinger Inc.) based on the data you provided, broken down into sections and then summarized:

**0) Report Structure:**

*   **Raw Data:** Presenting the numbers as you provided.
*   **Simple Analysis:** Interpreting the meaning of the numbers in a clear and concise way.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** SDGR
*   **Company Overview:** Schrodinger Inc. is a company that develops software for drug discovery and materials science.
*   **SDGR Cumulative Return:** -55.61%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 70.37%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Max: 42.2
    *   Min: -127.1
    *   Current: -126.0
    *   Relative Divergence: 0.6

*   **Analysis:**  SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period. The cumulative return is deeply negative, indicating substantial losses. The current divergence is near the minimum, suggesting the underperformance is at its worst point within the observed range.  The relative divergence of 0.6 suggests it's at the very bottom of its historical divergence range.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|----------|---------|----------|------|--------|
    | 2024-2026  | -61.0%   | 82.6%   | -139.0%  | 0.0  | 1.3    |

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** -61.0% indicates a significant average annual loss.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 82.6% represents a very large potential loss from peak to trough.
    *   **Alpha:** -139.0% indicates severe underperformance compared to its benchmark, beyond what Beta explains.
    *   **Beta:** 0.0 suggests the stock's movement is uncorrelated to the market (the S&P 500, presumably). This is unusual.
    *   **Cap(B):** 1.3 likely refers to the market capitalization in billions, although a Beta of 0 suggests to review the calculations.

    **Analysis:** The Alpha and Beta data paint a concerning picture. The stock is losing a significant amount of value yearly, has the potential to drop by more than 80% and does not move according to the market direction.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** $17.80
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $17.8, Previous Close: $17.8, Change: $0.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 18.228
*   **20-day SMA:** 17.945
*   **60-day SMA:** 18.8442

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently at $17.80, with no change from the previous close.  The 5-day SMA is slightly above the 20-day SMA, which are both below the 60-day SMA. This *could* suggest a short-term upward trend, but it's weak given the small differences. It may also suggest that it is currently underperforming in the short-term.
    *   5-day SMA (18.23) > Current Close (17.8): The recent prices were lower than in the past 5 days.
    *   20-day SMA (17.95) > Current Close (17.8): The recent prices were lower than in the past 20 days.
    *   60-day SMA (18.84) > Current Close (17.8): The recent prices were significantly lower than in the past 60 days.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.28
*   **PPO:** 0.3192
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -2.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Price Fluctuation:** No change, indicating no rebound or decline.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -6598.9

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:**  A high MRI (0.9) is paradoxical given the poor performance. It suggests the analysis *internally* views it as less risky, which needs further investigation (potential flaws in the MRI calculation, or reliance on different data). The MRI can be based on factors not captured by recent stock performance alone.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 50.28 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO (0.3192) indicates the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and a weak upward price momentum.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a "Buy" strategy, indicating that the stock is considered "very safe" with the intention to reallocate 100% of cash. This clashes dramatically with the actual price performance and the "Expected Return". It recommends investing 1.4% of total investment monthly.
    *   **Divergence Change:** A negative divergence change confirms a short-term downward trend relative to the comparison stock.
    *   **Expected Return:**  The massively negative expected return (-6598.9%) is extremely concerning. It signals very low confidence in future performance.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Headlines:**
    *   Unlocking Hidden Value
    *   Buy the Bottom Stock
    *   $24 Price Target
    *   Shares Purchased by Nikko Asset Management
    *   Schrödinger and Copernic hit milestone

*   **Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. Some articles suggest positive future potential ("Unlocking Hidden Value," "Buy the Bottom"), while others simply report on analyst targets and institutional investment. The price target of $24 from a new analyst forecast would be a significant increase from the current price, showing analyst support. Milestone announcements can also be a positive signal. *However*, remember to critically evaluate the sources and the actual reasoning behind the optimistic outlooks.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Key:** None
*   **Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell):** \-
*   **Opinions:** 9
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 27.22 / 33.00 / 18.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  No changes indicated.

*   **Analysis:** While there are 9 analyst opinions, the "Mean" rating is not available, hindering a simple judgment. The average target price of $27.22 suggests potential upside. However, consider the range ($18.00 - $33.00) which shows analyst disagreement on future performance. Absence of rating changes suggests the analysts haven't adjusted their views.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜         | EPS    | 매출      |
|--------------|--------|-----------|

| 2025-11-05   | -0.52  | 0.04 B$   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The company is consistently losing money (negative EPS).
    *   Revenue is relatively stable but low.
    *   There is no clear trend of improvement in either EPS or revenue over these periods.

**6) Financial Information:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

    | Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
    |--------------|----------|---------------|
    | 2025-09-30   | $0.05B   | 51.61%        |
    | 2025-06-30   | $0.05B   | 47.77%        |

    *   Revenues are low and relatively stable, except for a peak in Q4 2024.
    *   Profit Margins are high. This is quite unusual given the negative EPS reported above, and warrants further investigation to understand what is driving this margin given the losses.

    |--------------|----------|----------|

    | 2024-12-31   | $0.42B   | -9.54%   |
    | 2024-09-30   | $0.45B   | -8.49%   |

    *   Equity is decreasing, indicating the company is losing assets.
    *   ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, further confirming the company is not generating profits for its shareholders.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

SDGR has experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The stock price has been on a decline, with the current price below both short-term and long-term moving averages. The company is consistently losing money with negative earnings per share (EPS) and negative returns on equity (ROE). While some recent news articles suggest potential future value and an analyst target a higher stock price, the financial data paints a concerning picture. The hybrid signal suggesting a "Buy" strategy appears inconsistent with most of the data, especially the extremely negative expected return. **Overall, caution is warranted. The strong underperformance and negative financial indicators suggest a high-risk investment.** The high MRI should be scrutinized for its methodology and potential discrepancies. The high profit margins must be understood in light of the overall losses.
