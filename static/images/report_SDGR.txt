Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) is a biotechnology company focused on drug discovery using computational technologies.  Its performance significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period, lagging by 71.3 percentage points.  This is relatively lower than its historical underperformance range, sitting at the 17.1 percentile.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistently negative alpha across the reviewed periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements.  Specifically:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0% | 68.9% | -82.0% | 1.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0% | 68.9% | -73.0% | 2.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0% | 72.4% | -7.0% | 1.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 11.0% | 73.6% | -5.0% | 1.9 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($25.63) is slightly below the 5-day moving average ($25.95), suggesting recent downward pressure.  However, it's significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term rebound from a longer-term downtrend. The recent price change (-$0.58) shows a slight decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI (74.38) is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a near-term price correction.  The positive PPO (0.79) indicates bullish momentum, though this is countered by the RSI reading.  The 20-day relative divergence (-3.1) points to a short-term bearish trend. The MRI (0.37) indicates medium risk.

The expected return of -276.6% is extremely negative and likely reflects the current market sentiment and past performance.  This should not be taken as a literal prediction for long-term returns.  The significantly negative projected return highlights the substantial risk involved in investing in SDGR, especially compared to the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has reported consistent net losses (negative EPS) over the past few quarters, with relatively stable but low revenue.  There's no clear trend of improvement visible in the provided data.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR shows significant underperformance against the S&P 500, with consistent negative alpha and negative ROE. While recent price action suggests a potential short-term rebound, the negative earnings, overbought RSI, and extremely negative expected return highlight substantial risk.  Long-term investment requires a strong belief in the company's future prospects, considering the current financial performance and market sentiment.  Further due diligence, including an examination of the company's long-term strategic plans and competitive landscape, is strongly recommended before any investment decision.  The high profit margin is counterbalanced by the negative ROE, suggesting that while revenue may be effectively converted to profit, the efficiency in using shareholder capital is critically low.  The current data presents a bearish outlook for SDGR.
