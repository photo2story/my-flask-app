| 2023-2025  | -5.0%  | 82.6% | -72.0% | -0.0 | 1.3    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate is negative in most periods, indicating poor historical growth. The only positive CAGR is for the 2022-2024 period.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high (above 78%), indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is largely negative, meaning the stock has underperformed relative to its benchmark (adjusted for risk).
*   **Beta:** Beta is near 0 or -0, suggesting the stock's price is not highly correlated with the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization is around 1-2 billion dollars, indicating a mid- or small-cap company.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 17.56
*   **Previous Close:** 17.42
*   **Change:** 0.8%
*   **5-day SMA:** 17.202
*   **20-day SMA:** 18.0545
*   **60-day SMA:** 19.3829

**Analysis:** The stock price has increased slightly in the last day.  The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a potential downtrend, although the recent price increase could signal a short-term reversal.

**3. Index Indicators**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 47.64
*   **PPO:** 0.0813
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (57 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-28)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.6 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2980.5

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the negative returns, the MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended." This is very unusual and requires further investigation. The MRI could be based on a model that considers factors beyond simple historical returns, or it could be an anomaly.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is around 47.6, which is neutral and does not indicate overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is slightly positive, suggesting a slight upward trend in momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying using all available cash, labeling it "Very Safe."  Again, this contradicts the negative performance and high risk indicators.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The 20-day relative divergence change indicates a short-term increase, corroborating the recent price increase.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-2980.5%) is a major red flag. It suggests the model used to calculate this expects the stock to perform very poorly.
*   **Change (0.8):** The recent change is moderate and not necessarily a sharp increase or decrease.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue is relatively small, ranging from $40 to $90 million per quarter.
*   **Profit Margin:**  Profit margins are high (above 47%) even with negative earning, so the company appears to be very efficient at generating profit once all cost is incurred.
*   **Equity:** Equity has been decreasing over the past year, indicating a potential erosion of the company's asset base.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity is consistently negative, confirming that the company is not generating profits relative to its equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

SDGR presents a mixed and concerning picture.  Key observations:

*   **Underperformance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **High Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility.
*   **Negative Profitability:** The company has consistently reported negative EPS and negative ROE.
*   **Declining Equity:** Equity is decreasing.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation which seems out of place. Analyst target prices suggest upside potential, but the lack of a consensus rating and the very negative expected return are concerning. The "buy the bottom" sentiment clashes with the risk warnings.
*   **Short-Term Positive Indicators:** There is some indication of short-term positive momentum (recent price increase, slight PPO increase, positive divergence change).
*   **Technology Breakthrough Potential:** Schrodinger and Copernic hit milestone; Neptune shows over 2x ammonia yield

**Conclusion:** SDGR is a high-risk investment. While some analysts see potential upside, the negative profitability, declining equity, high volatility, and extremely negative expected return should give investors pause. The conflicting signals from different indicators make it difficult to form a clear picture.  Further investigation into the company's financials, business model, and the reasons behind the high MRI recommendation is crucial before making any investment decisions.

**Recommendation:** Given the information provided, a cautious approach is warranted. **It is not recommended to invest without further, thorough due diligence.**
