**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Schrodinger Inc. is a company that uses physics-based computational platforms to advance drug discovery and materials science.  (Note: A more detailed description would improve the analysis)

The cumulative return of SDGR (-40.79%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 21.46%.  The -62.2% difference highlights substantial underperformance.  While the relative divergence of 21.8% puts the current underperformance within its historical range, this still indicates poor performance compared to the market benchmark.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows consistently negative alpha, suggesting the stock's underperformance cannot be solely attributed to market movements.  The beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market changes over time.


| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0%  | 68.9%   | -81.0% | -0.0  | 1.4    |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0%  | 68.9%   | -71.0% | -0.0  | 2.6    |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0%    | 72.4%   | -5.0%  | -0.0  | 1.4    |
| 2023-2025  | 13.0%   | 73.6%   | -0.3  | 1.9   |        |


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $26.54
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $21.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $22.53

The price of $26.54 shows a recent increase from the previous close of $24.49 (8.37% change). This indicates a recent, sharp upward movement, despite the longer-term negative trend.  The price is above the short-term moving averages (5 and 20-day), but below the longer-term 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend, but still under the longer-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 66.87 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 3.25 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.2 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -194.6% (This extremely negative value needs further clarification. The methodology for calculating this should be explained.)  The sharp price increase (8.37% change) likely contributes to this figure and this needs to be taken in context.

The high MRI suggests a high-risk investment. While the PPO shows positive momentum and the RSI is approaching overbought territory, the negative relative divergence and extremely negative projected return indicate caution.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR significantly underperforms the S&P 500, displaying consistent negative alpha and fluctuating beta.  While the recent price surge is noteworthy, the company's fundamentals remain weak, indicated by negative EPS, fluctuating profit margins, and negative ROE. The high-risk MRI and negative expected return, along with the overall negative trend, highlight significant investment risk.  Further investigation into the -194.6% expected return calculation is essential before drawing definitive conclusions.  More detailed analysis including a deeper dive into the company's business model, future projections and competitive landscape is needed before a comprehensive investment decision can be made.  The short-term price increase may be a temporary anomaly.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the ongoing losses and weak financial performance before investing.
