**0. Key Figures & Initial Observations:**

SDGR, Schrodinger Inc., is a company focused on drug discovery using computational platforms.  The company's performance significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The stock shows negative returns and high volatility, warranting further investigation.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **SDGR Cumulative Return:** -46.47%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 20.79%
* **Cumulative Return Difference:** -67.3% (SDGR underperformed VOO by 67.3%)
* **Relative Divergence:** -67.3% places SDGR in the 17.8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates that while significantly underperforming, its current underperformance is not entirely unprecedented within its historical context.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0% | 68.9% | -81.0% | -0.0 | 1.4   |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0% | 68.9% | -71.0% | -0.0 | 2.6   |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0%   | 72.4% | -5.0%  | -0.0 | 1.4   |
| 2023-2025  | 7.0%   | 73.6% | -3.0%  | -0.3 | 1.4   |

The consistently negative alpha indicates underperformance against the market benchmark even after considering beta (market risk exposure).  High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights significant risk. The fluctuating Beta suggests varying market sensitivity over time.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $19.22
* **Previous Close:** $19.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $18.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.579
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $22.3126

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-to-medium-term trend.  The recent price drop of -$1.54 reflects a negative market sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.13 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions, but not necessarily a buy signal)
* **PPO:** -0.55 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +0.3 (Short-term upward movement, but needs confirmation)
* **Expected Return:** -252.8% (This extremely negative figure needs more context.  It's likely based on current conditions and may not accurately reflect long-term potential, especially with additional investment.)

The indicators paint a mixed picture. While RSI suggests oversold conditions and there's recent short-term upward movement in relative divergence, the negative PPO and extremely low expected return raise serious concerns.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.52  | $0.04 B      |
| 2024-07-31 | -$0.74  | $0.05 B      |
| 2024-05-01 | -$0.76  | $0.04 B      |
| 2023-11-01 | -$0.86  | $0.04 B      |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.86  | $0.04 B      |  *(Note: Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*

Consistent negative EPS indicates ongoing losses. Revenue is relatively stable but low.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B    | 72.61%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.04B    | 50.24%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $0.07B    | 77.64%        |

High profit margins are somewhat misleading given the low revenue and negative EPS. Further investigation into the nature of these margins is needed.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity    | ROE          |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.42B    | -9.54%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B    | -5.59%        |

Negative ROE across all quarters reflects a concerning lack of profitability and return on investment.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR exhibits significant underperformance against the S&P 500, marked by consistent negative returns, high volatility, and negative EPS. While some technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the negative PPO and dramatically negative expected return signal considerable risk.  The high profit margins reported need further investigation to understand their nature in the context of overall negative profitability.  Before considering any investment, thorough due diligence is crucial, including a deeper understanding of the company's business model, future prospects, and the reasons behind the negative financial performance.  The data suggests significant challenges for SDGR, requiring cautious consideration before investment.
