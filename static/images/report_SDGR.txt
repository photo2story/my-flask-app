| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -70.0% | 78.2% | -76.0% | 0.0   | 1.3    |

| 2023-2025  | -3.0%  | 82.6% | -70.0% | -0.0  | 1.3    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR is negative for all periods except 2022-2024, indicating poor overall growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The high MDD figures (around 80%) signify substantial risk and volatility, meaning the stock has experienced significant declines from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha values suggest that SDGR has consistently underperformed its expected return based on its risk (Beta).
*   **Beta:** A Beta near 0 suggests that SDGR's price is relatively uncorrelated to the market's (S&P 500) movements. This might indicate that company-specific factors are driving its performance more than broad market trends.

*   **Current Close:** 18.31
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 17.84, Previous Close: 18.31, Change: -2.57
*   **5-day SMA:** 18.51
*   **20-day SMA:** 17.90
*   **60-day SMA:** 18.95

**Analysis:**

*   The current price (17.84) is below the 5-day and 60-day SMAs, but slightly above the 20-day SMA. The fact that the price is below all the SMA's except the 20-day is a near-term bearish trend. The recent negative change (-2.57%) indicates downward price pressure.

*   **RSI:** 56.69
*   **PPO:** 0.84
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.7 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -5407.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The "Medium Investment" recommendation based on the MRI suggests moderate risk, implying it's not a high-conviction buy.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 56.69 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO (0.84) suggests the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which can be a bullish signal, but must be considered with caution given the other indicators.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal advocates for buying, which is inconsistent with the expected return data.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence reinforces the short-term bearish trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-5407.7%) is concerning and warrants further investigation.  It could be a data error, an artifact of the model, or indicative of severe underlying problems.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Headlines:**
    *   "Unlocking Hidden Value in Schrodinger's Box" (Seeking Alpha)
    *   "Here's Why Schrodinger (SDGR) Is a Great 'Buy the Bottom' Stock Now" (Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq)

    *   "Schrodinger, Inc. (NASDAQ:SDGR) Given Consensus Rating of 'Hold' by Brokerages" (MarketBeat)

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. While some articles suggest a potential "buy the bottom" opportunity, others highlight milestones and analyst ratings, but overall, there is not a strong consensus on the company's prospects. The "Hold" rating and the absence of overwhelmingly positive catalysts suggest a cautious approach.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (Mean: 1.44)
*   **Opinions:** 9
*   **Target Price:** Avg: $27.22, High: $33.00, Low: $18.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not provided

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is surprisingly optimistic, considering the underperformance. A "Strong Buy" rating with a mean of 1.44 suggests strong confidence from analysts. The average target price of $27.22 indicates substantial upside potential from the current price ($17.84). However, the wide range between the high and low target prices ($33 vs. $18) suggests uncertainty among analysts.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates, with a peak in Q4 2024.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins appear healthy, suggesting that when the company makes sales, it maintains a good profit margin.  The 72.61% in Q4 2024 is particularly high.  However, this doesn't translate to overall profitability due to other expenses.
*   **Equity:** Equity is decreasing over the analyzed periods, which is not a positive sign.
*   **ROE:** Negative ROE figures indicate that the company is not generating returns on its equity. The declining trend in ROE suggests worsening profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) is facing significant challenges. It has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting substantial volatility and negative Alpha.  While analyst consensus leans towards a "Strong Buy" with a considerable upside target price, the fundamental data paints a concerning picture. The company is consistently losing money (negative EPS and ROE), and its equity is declining.

The news is mixed, with some articles suggesting a potential "buy the bottom," but a recent "Hold" rating from brokerages indicates caution. The technical indicators are also mixed, with a neutral RSI and a Hybrid Signal suggesting a buy, but a negative divergence trend and extremely negative expected return raise red flags.

**Overall, the data suggests a high-risk investment. While analysts are optimistic and the stock may be oversold, the company's poor financial performance and negative trends cannot be ignored. A potential investment should be approached with extreme caution, and further due diligence is strongly recommended to understand the reasons behind the discrepancies between analyst opinions and fundamental data.**
