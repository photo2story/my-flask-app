**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) is a company that develops and applies physics-based computational platforms to drug discovery and materials science.  Over the reviewed period, SDGR significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return of -42.65% compared to VOO's 24.62%.  This represents a substantial -67.3% difference.  The relative divergence of 20.2% indicates that while underperforming, the current situation is not the most extreme underperformance historically observed.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values suggest SDGR exhibits high beta (above 1), indicating high sensitivity to market movements.  The negative alpha values consistently point to underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  While recent quarters show slightly improved CAGR, the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights significant risk.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0%  | 68.9%   | -82.0% | -0.1   | 1.4    |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0%  | 68.9%   | -73.0% | -0.1   | 2.6    |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0%    | 72.4%   | -7.0%  | -0.1   | 1.4    |
| 2023-2025  | 11.0%   | 73.6%   | -1.0%  | -0.4   | 1.9    |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $25.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $21.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $22.80

The price is currently above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the recent price decline (-2.04 from the previous close) warrants further investigation.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 69.27 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.90 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -223.0% (This indicates significantly lower expected returns than S&P 500 over the long term, which is concerning.  This projection should be critically examined as it seems unrealistic).
* **Price Change:** The recent -2.04 change indicates a short-term downturn; it's not a sharp drop, but still noteworthy.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses. Revenue growth appears relatively stagnant.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of these losses.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -0.52   | $0.04 B     |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some variability, while profit margins are relatively high, suggesting operational efficiency despite the losses.  However, negative ROE consistently indicates the company is not generating returns on equity.  This needs further investigation to determine the underlying causes.


| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.09B    | 72.61%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.04B    | 50.24%        |

| 2023-12-31  | $0.55B   | -5.59%    |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR has significantly underperformed the market (VOO) over the reviewed period. While some short-term indicators suggest a potential uptrend, the negative EPS, consistently negative ROE, and the extremely negative long-term expected return projection paint a concerning picture.  The high beta highlights the substantial risk associated with this investment.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the reasons behind the persistent losses and the extremely negative long-term expected return is crucial.  The -223% long-term projection should be treated with extreme skepticism and further investigated.  It is advisable to thoroughly review the company's financial statements, management discussions, and industry outlook before considering any investment in SDGR.
