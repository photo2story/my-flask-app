**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4253 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 29.16 (Suggests oversold conditions, but this should be interpreted cautiously in conjunction with other factors)

* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +2.3 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -633.9%  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern.  It suggests a very high risk and a very low probability of outperforming the market index over a 2+ year period.  The large negative change (-5.08%) in the last market price further highlights the current downward pressure on the stock.  This extreme negative expected return requires further investigation into the underlying assumptions and data used to derive this figure.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

SDGR exhibits significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, marked by consistently negative alpha, high maximum drawdowns, and negative ROE.  While some indicators (like RSI) might suggest oversold conditions, the negative earnings, flat revenue, and extremely negative expected return paint a concerning picture.  The high profit margins reported despite net losses need further scrutiny.  Currently, SDGR presents a high-risk investment, and the provided data strongly suggests that long-term investors should proceed with extreme caution. Further investigation into the company's specific business model, competitive landscape, and future prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -633.9% expected return should be critically reviewed for accuracy.
