Schrodinger Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on drug discovery using computational methods.  Over the periods analyzed, SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a substantial negative return difference of -64.7%.  This is within the historical range of -93.7% to 37.3%, placing its current relative performance at the 22.1 percentile.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals consistently negative alpha values, suggesting underperformance relative to the market benchmark,  and fluctuating beta values indicating varying levels of market sensitivity.  High maximum drawdown (MDD) values highlight significant price drops during these periods.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a slightly positive CAGR, but the negative alpha persists.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0% | 68.9% | -82.0% | 1.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0% | 68.9% | -73.0% | 2.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0% | 72.4% | -7.0% | 1.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 11.0% | 73.6% | -0.4 | 1.9 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $25.75
* **5-day Moving Average:** $25.52
* **20-day Moving Average:** $21.23
* **60-day Moving Average:** $22.73

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The significant difference between the closing price and the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a relatively sharp recent price increase.  The last market data shows a 2.14% price jump from the previous closing. This is a rapid increase compared to the longer-term performance trends.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 68.71 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 3.95 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -197.8% (Extremely negative)

The combination of RSI nearing overbought levels and a positive PPO suggests potential for a short-term correction.  The significant positive change in relative divergence points to a recent short-term upward trend, but this needs to be evaluated in the context of overall negative expected returns. The substantial price jump on the last day indicates a sharp uptrend that might be unsustainable.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative EPS and relatively low revenue figures.  There is no clear upward trend in revenue, and the EPS remains negative throughout the provided data.  Further investigation into the reasons behind these financial results is crucial.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR exhibits significant underperformance against the S&P 500, both in the long term and projected into the future.  While recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, the company's financial performance (negative EPS, fluctuating revenue, negative ROE) raises significant concerns.  The high profit margins are offset by persistently negative earnings.  The negative projected long-term return further suggests that, based on this data, SDGR is a high-risk investment with little prospect of outperforming the market.  Further deep-dive analysis into the company's operational strategy and future prospects is necessary before considering any investment.  The recent price jump should be viewed with caution given the overall negative outlook.
