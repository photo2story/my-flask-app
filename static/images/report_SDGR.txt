*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 69.04%
*   **Divergence:** -123.2 (Relative Divergence: 2.3)

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is largely negative across the periods, highlighting a consistent lack of growth and capital loss.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown figures indicate significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** The consistently negative Alpha values suggests that SDGR has underperformed relative to its expected return based on its risk profile (Beta).
*   **Beta:** A Beta close to 0 suggests that the stock's price is not very reactive to the moves in the market index as a whole.
*   **Cap(B):** The company's capitalization in billions of dollars varies between 1.3 and 2.6 during the observed time range.

**Analysis:** The recent price shows an upward movement. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is in turn below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a possible short-term upward trend, but the price is still trading below the 60-day moving average which can act as resistance. The increase in price (change: 2.67%) from the previous day is relatively large.

*   **RSI:** An RSI of 59.66 is approaching overbought territory (above 70).
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.3777 suggests the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, indicating a possible emerging uptrend, but the value is still very small.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal indicates a buy signal.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:**  The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a recent short-term increase in the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests analysts anticipate continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This should be viewed with caution as such large negative figures can be caused by underlying model instabilities.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (1.44 Mean Rating)
*   **Opinions:** 9
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 27.22 / 33.00 / 18.00

**Analysis:** Despite the current stock underperformance and negative expected return, the analyst consensus is "Strong Buy".  The average price target of $27.22 suggests a significant upside potential from the current price of $17.66. However, one must consider the negative expected return as previously calculated in conjunction with analyst opinions. The relatively wide range of target prices (18.00 to 33.00) indicates uncertainty among analysts.
