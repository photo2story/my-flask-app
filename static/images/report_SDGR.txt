## Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) Stock Review

**0. Overview:** Schrodinger, Inc. is a company focused on applying physics-based computational technologies to drug discovery and materials science.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Schrodinger (SDGR) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  The cumulative return for SDGR is -41.95%, while VOO shows a 28.91% return. This results in a substantial difference of -70.9%, placing it at the 17.4th percentile of the historical range (-93.7% to 37.3%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently negative alpha values across different time periods, indicating SDGR underperformed the market benchmark.  The beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity.  It's important to note that a high beta (e.g., 2.6 in 2021-2023) implies higher volatility compared to the market.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) also appears to have fluctuated.  Further investigation into the reasons for such large negative returns is needed.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0%  | 68.9%   | -0.1   | 1.4    |        |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0%  | 68.9%   | -0.1   | 2.6    |        |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0%    | 72.4%   | -0.1   | 1.4    |        |
| 2023-2025  | 11.0%   | 73.6%   | -0.4   | 1.9    |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $25.78.  The stock price shows a slight upward trend in the short term.

* **Closing Price:** $25.78
* **5-day MA:** $25.91
* **20-day MA:** $22.99
* **60-day MA:** $22.85

The price is above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the recent price action is not sufficiently strong to negate the significantly negative performance over the long term.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Medium Risk) suggesting moderate risk associated with the stock.
* **RSI:** 78.03 – This high RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought, indicating a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO:** 1.23 – A positive PPO value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -5.0 – This indicates a recent short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return:** -270.5% – This extremely negative expected return highlights the significant risk associated with the stock.  A long-term investment strategy needs to be carefully considered.  The extremely low expectation is due to the severely negative returns presented in prior analysis.
* **Price Change:** A small positive daily change (+$0.12) is insignificant in relation to the overall performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative EPS and relatively flat revenue.  This is a major concern and directly contributes to the negative stock performance.  Further investigation into the reasons for ongoing losses is necessary.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.52 | $0.04B        |

|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B    | 72.61%        |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Schrodinger (SDGR) presents a high-risk investment. The consistently negative EPS, negative ROE, and significant underperformance against the S&P 500 raise serious concerns. While some short-term technical indicators suggest potential upward movement, the fundamental weaknesses overshadow any short-term optimism.  The extremely negative expected return necessitates careful consideration and extensive due diligence before any investment is considered.  A long-term investment strategy should only be pursued after thorough research into the reasons for the company's ongoing losses and a strong belief in its future prospects.  Given the current data, it is difficult to recommend SDGR as a buy at this time.
