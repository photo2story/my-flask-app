**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Schrodinger Inc. is a biotechnology company that uses physics-based computational platforms to discover and develop drugs.  The company's stock significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the considered period, with a difference of -64.4% in cumulative return.  While this is a substantial underperformance, the relative divergence of 20.1% suggests this isn't its historically worst performance compared to the VOO. The provided CAGR data shows high volatility and significant losses in the past, with recent years showing small positive returns.  The consistently negative Alpha indicates underperformance compared to the market, and the Beta exceeding 1 implies higher volatility than the market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0% | 68.9% | -81.0% | 1.3 |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0% | 68.9% | -71.0% | 2.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0% | 72.4% | -5.0% | 1.4 |

* **Closing Price:** $19.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $18.52
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $22.31

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend. The recent drop of $0.61 suggests short-term bearish pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4271 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.47 (approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.93 (indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +6.6% (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -216.2% (This extremely negative expected return needs further clarification.  It's likely related to the substantial underperformance against the VOO, but lacks context on the time horizon.  The negative sign might reflect that this number represents a loss, not a gain, if the S&P 500 gains are used as a benchmark).

The recent price drop of -3.12% suggests a potential short-term correction or bearish trend continuation. The RSI and PPO support a bearish outlook, although the positive relative divergence change suggests some short-term upward pressure. The extremely low expected return warns against significant risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with consistently negative EPS and fluctuating revenue.  While some short-term positive indicators exist (relative divergence change), the overall picture is bearish.  The negative ROE and high volatility (Beta > 1) further increase the risk.  The -216.2% expected return (requiring clarification on its calculation and timeframe) is extremely concerning.  Investing in SDGR requires a high-risk tolerance and a long-term perspective, contingent on a significant improvement in the company's financial performance and market outlook.  Further research into the company's pipeline, competitive landscape, and any potential catalysts for growth is crucial before considering any investment.  The provided data suggest a strong case against investment at this time.
