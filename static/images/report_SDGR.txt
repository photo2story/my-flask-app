**1. Performance Comparison:**

Schrodinger, Inc. (SDGR) is a biotechnology company focused on drug discovery using physics-based computational methods.  Over the relevant period, SDGR significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a -61.15% difference in cumulative returns.  The provided relative divergence metric suggests that while this underperformance is substantial, it's not unprecedented in the historical context of the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently negative alpha, indicating underperformance compared to the market benchmark, and a beta generally above 1 suggesting higher volatility than the market. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows improvement from negative values in 2020-2023 to positive values in 2023-2025.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0% | 68.9% | -82.0% | 1.3 |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0% | 68.9% | -73.0% | 2.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0% | 72.4% | -7.0% | 1.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 12.0% | 73.6% | -0.4 | 1.9 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $26.19
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $25.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $21.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $22.76

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates a recent price stabilization following a period of increased volatility which is evidenced by the larger difference between the 20- and 60-day moving averages compared to the 5-day average.  The last day's price change of 1.71% indicates a small, but noticeable increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 70.55 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 3.836 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +4.3% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -169.4% (This suggests a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, if current trends continue.)


The high RSI value and the significantly negative expected return warrant caution. While short-term momentum appears positive, the long-term outlook remains bearish relative to the S&P 500.  The recent price increase needs to be considered within the context of the overall negative trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

SDGR has consistently reported negative EPS and relatively low revenue. While the most recent quarter shows slightly improved revenue, profitability remains a concern.

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출        |

| 2024-11-12 | -0.52   | $0.04 B     |

| 2024-11-12 | -0.86   | $0.04 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability show some quarterly fluctuations, but are generally volatile.  The negative ROE indicates the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  This is a significant concern for long-term investors.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR's performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, showing substantial underperformance.  While recent price action shows some positive short-term momentum, the negative expected return, consistently negative EPS, and negative ROE raise significant concerns.  The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought.  Long-term investors should proceed with extreme caution and consider the considerable risks associated with this investment.  Further investigation into the company's future prospects and the reasons for its underperformance is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests a high risk profile, and the negative expected return is a serious warning sign.
