* **5-Day Moving Average:** $20.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $21.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $22.50

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The recent price drop of -4.64% from the previous close suggests a potentially significant negative event impacting the stock.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.04 (approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.5% (short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -947.4%  This extremely negative expected return needs further clarification and context.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.52  | $0.04 B     |

| 2024-11-12 | -$0.86  | $0.04 B     | *(Duplicate entry)*

The company is consistently reporting negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses. While revenue shows some fluctuation, it remains relatively low and doesn't appear to be offsetting the losses. The duplicate entry for November 12th, 2024 needs clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Schrodinger (SDGR) exhibits significant underperformance against the S&P 500, characterized by consistently negative EPS, negative ROE, and a substantial negative expected return.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  While some quarters show high profit margins, the overall financial health is concerning due to negative ROE and persistent losses. The extremely negative expected return (-947.4%) warrants further investigation to understand its basis.  Before considering any investment, a thorough investigation into the reasons for the company's poor performance and future outlook is crucial.  The current situation indicates a high-risk investment with significant downside potential.  Given the current data, a long-term investment in SDGR relative to VOO is not advisable.
