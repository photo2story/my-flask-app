**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Schrodinger Inc. is a company focused on using physics-based computational technologies for drug discovery and materials science.  As shown, SDGR significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, exhibiting a cumulative return of -41.48% compared to VOO's 22.80%. The substantial negative difference highlights considerable underperformance. The alpha consistently shows negative values across the given periods (-0.1 to -0.4), indicating underperformance compared to the benchmark. The beta values (1.4-2.6) signify higher volatility than the market.  The large negative CAGR values across the periods further underscore the underperformance.  Note that MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is extremely high, indicating significant risk.  Finally, the market capitalization varies from period to period, which reflects changes in the company's valuation.



**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $25.99
* **5-day Moving Average:** $25.75
* **20-day Moving Average:** $21.62
* **60-day Moving Average:** $22.78

The closing price is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the recent price change of -$0.76 (-2.9%) indicates a slight downward correction.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 73.85 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 3.48 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -194.5% (This is a very large negative number, suggesting significant risk and potential for further losses over the long term.  This figure needs further clarification of its calculation methodology).

The relatively high RSI and positive PPO suggest upward momentum, but the MRI indicates medium risk and the extremely negative expected return warrants caution.  The recent price drop of -$0.76 is noteworthy but not necessarily indicative of a dramatic shift.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, marked by substantial negative cumulative returns and consistently negative EPS. While some technical indicators suggest potential short-term upward momentum, the negative expected return, high risk indicators, and negative ROE raise significant concerns.  The inconsistent revenue growth and declining equity further add to the risk profile.  The data provided points to a high-risk investment with a substantial potential for further losses.  Further investigation into the causes of the consistently negative earnings and the methodology behind the extremely negative expected return is highly recommended before considering any investment in SDGR.  The provided duplicated data needs clarification and correction.
