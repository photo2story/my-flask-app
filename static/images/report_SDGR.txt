As of the last data point, SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a 104.5% negative difference in cumulative returns.

High Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) further highlight the significant risk associated with this stock.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -67.0% | 60.2% | -88.0% | 0.0 | 1.3 |
| 2021-2023  | -76.0% | 60.2% | -0.0 | 2.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0% | 60.2% | -0.1 | 1.4 |
| 2023-2025  | -2.0% | 56.4% | -0.3 | 1.4 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock closed at $20.26, slightly higher than the last market price of $19.77.  All moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day) are above the current price, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 46.8 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.  The negative PPO (-0.68) indicates bearish momentum.  The recent negative relative divergence (-3.1) reinforces the short-term downward trend. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.43 suggests a medium risk level.  The provided expected return of -1021.3% is exceptionally low and likely unrealistic.  It's crucial to understand the methodology behind this calculation.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy might yield better returns than this extremely negative projection suggests, but relative to the S&P500, the severe underperformance is highly concerning.  The sharp daily price drop (-0.98) from the previous closing price highlights the recent volatility and downward pressure on SDGR.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  Revenue is relatively flat, suggesting a lack of growth.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-12 | -0.52 | $0.04B |
| 2024-07-31 | -0.74 | $0.05B |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.76 | $0.04B |
| 2023-11-01 | -0.86 | $0.04B |
| 2024-11-12 | -0.86 | $0.04B |  *(Note: Duplicate entry for 2024-11-12)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains low. Profit margins are relatively high, suggesting some operational efficiency, however, these are likely artificially high considering the company’s negative earnings.  Equity is gradually decreasing, and ROE is consistently negative, signifying that the company is not generating returns on its investments.  This is a significant concern.


| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B | 72.61% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.04B | 50.24% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.05B | 66.20% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.04B | 51.61% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.07B | 77.64% |


| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.42B | -9.54% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.45B | -8.49% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.47B | -11.40% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) presents a highly risky investment profile.  Consistent negative EPS, declining equity, negative ROE, and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 all point towards substantial challenges. While some financial metrics like profit margins appear positive, they are misleading in the context of overall losses and declining equity.  The high negative expected return (-1021.3%) highlights the need for extreme caution.  Before considering any investment, a thorough fundamental analysis is necessary, as current indicators suggest high risk and potential for further losses. The negative trends necessitate a careful review of the company's long-term strategy and prospects for profitability.
