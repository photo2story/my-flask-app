**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.52  | $0.04 B        |
| 2024-07-31 | -$0.74  | $0.05 B        |
| 2024-05-01 | -$0.76  | $0.04 B        |
| 2023-11-01 | -$0.86  | $0.04 B        |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.86  | $0.04 B        |

The company continues to report negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  While revenue shows some slight increase, it is not enough to offset losses. The repeated -$0.86 EPS in November is concerning, needing further explanation.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B    | 72.61%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.04B    | 50.24%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.05B    | 66.20%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.04B    | 51.61%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.07B    | 77.64%        |

Revenue is fluctuating, and while profit margins appear relatively high in some quarters, this doesn't fully translate into positive net income.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE          |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.42B    | -9.54%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.45B    | -8.49%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.47B    | -11.40%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.51B    | -10.65%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B    | -5.59%        |

Negative ROE consistently indicates the company is not generating profits on its equity.  This is a significant red flag.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500,  high volatility, and consistently negative earnings. While some improvement in revenue is observed,  negative EPS, negative ROE, and a highly negative projected return signal substantial risk.  The company's long-term viability and the potential for a turnaround require careful consideration and further analysis beyond the provided data.  Investors should approach this stock with extreme caution.  More detailed analysis of the companyâ€™s business model, pipeline, and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.
