| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|-------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 4.0%     | 82.6%   | -65.0%  | -0.0  | 1.6    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Shows a negative Compound Annual Growth Rate in earlier periods, turning positive in the most recent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025).
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha suggests SDGR has underperformed relative to its benchmark, even when adjusted for risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to zero indicate SDGR's price is not highly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500).

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movements

**Numbers:**

*   Current Price: 21.74
*   Last Market Data: {'price': 21.74, 'previousClose': 21.77, 'change': -0.14}
*   5-Day Moving Average: 21.836
*   20-Day Moving Average: 20.7605
*   60-Day Moving Average: 19.8048

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a potential short-term pullback after a recent upward trend. The `change` of -0.14 from the previous close doesn't represent a significant price swing.

### 3. Indicators and Expected Return

**Numbers:**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 54.48
*   PPO: 0.877
*   Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change: 0.5 (Positive)
*   Expected Return: -2639.8%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.9 suggests a generally favorable market environment for investment.
*   The RSI of 54.48 indicates a neutral condition, not overbought or oversold.
*   The PPO of 0.877 suggests the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, indicating a slight upward trend.
*   The positive change in relative divergence suggests a recent short-term upward movement in SDGR's performance relative to the S&P 500.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends a full investment of cash (100% buy) with a small monthly investment, indicating a very safe approach, aligning with the high MRI.
*   **However, the Expected Return of -2639.8% is extremely negative and warrants serious concern.** It suggests a very high risk of substantial losses if investing for the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500. This discrepancy between the MRI (market environment) and the expected return for SDGR needs further investigation.

### 7. Overall Summary

Schrodinger (SDGR) is a company in the AI-driven biotech space that is receiving analyst attention. It operates in a potentially high-growth area (AI in biotechnology). However, several red flags exist:

*   **Underperformance:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, both in cumulative returns and Alpha.
*   **Negative Earnings & ROE:** Consistent negative EPS and ROE indicate a lack of profitability.
*   **Decreasing Equity:** Decreasing equity raises concerns about the company's financial health.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The -2639.8% expected return is alarming and requires careful scrutiny. This could be due to specific modeling assumptions, but it signals significant risk.

**Recommendation:** While the analyst consensus is "Buy" and there's excitement around AI in biotech, the financial data suggests a high-risk investment. The extremely negative expected return should be investigated before considering any investment. Closely monitor the upcoming Q3 2025 earnings report for any signs of improvement. Proceed with extreme caution.
