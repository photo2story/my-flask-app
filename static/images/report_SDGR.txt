**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Schrodinger Inc. is a biotechnology company that uses advanced computational methods to discover and develop novel therapeutics.

The cumulative return of SDGR (-47.26%) is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) (13.83%).  The difference of -61.1% highlights considerable underperformance. The relative divergence of 22.7% suggests that while the current underperformance is substantial, it has been worse historically.  The alpha consistently near zero across periods suggests it doesn't outperform the market after adjusting for beta. High beta (1.3-2.6) indicates higher volatility than the market.  While the most recent period shows positive returns, the overall trend shows significant underperformance.

* **Closing Price:** $18.21
* **Last Market Price:** $18.085 (Down $0.69)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $18.77
* **20-day Moving Average:** $21.06
* **60-day Moving Average:** $22.33

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The recent drop of $0.69 suggests some negative market sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk) -  Suggests significant volatility and potential for further downside.
* **RSI:** 24.03 (Oversold) – While an oversold condition can signal a potential bounce, it doesn't guarantee a price increase.
* **PPO:** -1.59 (Bearish) - Confirms the negative momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.3% (Short-term upward movement) – This short-term upward movement is in contrast to the longer-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return:** -183.9% - This extremely negative expected return suggests a highly pessimistic outlook for the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This should be interpreted with caution, as such extreme predictions are often unreliable.  The negative expected return should be viewed in the context of the company's recent underperformance and high-risk profile.

The significant price drop of $0.69 indicates a potentially sharp negative market reaction to recent news or developments (requires further investigation).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.52 | $0.04B       |
| 2024-07-31 | -$0.74 | $0.05B       |
| 2024-05-01 | -$0.76 | $0.04B       |
| 2023-11-01 | -$0.86 | $0.04B       |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.86 | $0.04B       |

Consistent net losses are a significant concern.  Revenue is relatively flat, and there's no clear indication of improving profitability. The repeated -$0.86 entry on 2024-11-12 needs clarification; it may be a duplicate entry or data entry error.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B     | 72.61%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.04B     | 50.24%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.05B     | 66.20%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.04B     | 51.61%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.07B     | 77.64%        |

Revenue fluctuates, though generally increasing. Profit margin is high but inconsistent, indicating operational challenges.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE         |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.42B     | -9.54%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.45B     | -8.49%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.47B     | -11.40%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.51B     | -10.65%      |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B     | -5.59%       |

Negative Return on Equity (ROE) across all periods demonstrates that the company is not generating returns on shareholder investment.  Equity is decreasing, suggesting potential financial difficulties.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR is currently exhibiting significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, reflected in a large negative cumulative return and a high-risk profile. Negative EPS, inconsistent profitability, fluctuating revenue, and negative ROE all point to underlying financial weaknesses.  While some short-term technical indicators suggest potential for a bounce, the overall trend is bearish, and the extremely negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 warrants extreme caution.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative earnings and the recent price drop is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high beta highlights the stock's volatility.  Given the current data, a long-term investment in SDGR carries considerable risk.
