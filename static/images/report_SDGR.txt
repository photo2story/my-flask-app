The price is currently above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. However, it is slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating a minor recent pullback. The 1.65% daily change suggests a small, positive price movement.

* **Expected Return:** -317.9% (This extremely negative figure requires further investigation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company is currently reporting significant net losses. Revenue is relatively flat.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |

| 2024-11-12 | -$0.86   | $0.04 B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some variability, but overall growth is not evident from this data. Profit margins are high, but this is likely due to the extremely low revenue and very high negative profits.  The high margins do not offset the overall losses. ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on equity.

| Quarter    | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B      | 72.61%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.04B      | 50.24%        |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR is currently significantly underperforming the market, showing negative returns and high volatility.  The company is not currently profitable and lacks revenue growth. While the profit margins are high, this is misleading given the extremely low revenue and massive net losses. Technical indicators paint a mixed picture, but the overall negative trend is clear. The extremely negative projected long-term return highlights significant risk.  A long-term investment in SDGR should be approached with extreme caution given the current financial performance.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the companyâ€™s poor performance is needed before making any investment decisions.  The negative expected return of -317.9% should be treated with suspicion and viewed as an indication of extremely high risk.  Additional research including a thorough examination of the company's business model and future prospects is strongly advised.
