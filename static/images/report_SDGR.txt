Okay, here's an analysis of Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) based on the data you provided. I will provide the analysis in English, with key numbers presented upfront, followed by a concise interpretation.

**Executive Summary**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) is a computational chemistry company that develops software for drug discovery and materials science.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in recent years.  Recent news and analyst sentiment suggest a potential "buy the bottom" opportunity, but financial performance remains weak.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **SDGR Cumulative Return:** -59.60%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 62.95%
*   **Absolute Divergence (Current):** -123.6%
*   **Divergence Range:** Max: 42.2, Min: -126.1
*   **Relative Divergence (Current):** 1.5

**Analysis:** SDGR has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500. The large negative divergence suggests a significant deviation from the overall market trend. The relative divergence being close to the minimum indicates that SDGR's performance is near its worst levels relative to the S&P 500 within the observed historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|------|-------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -70.0%  | 78.2% | -76.0% | 0.1  | 1.4    |
| 2021-2023  | -57.0%  | 81.0% | -59.0% | -0.0 | 2.6    |
| 2022-2024  | 6.0%    | 81.0% | -14.0% | -0.0 | 1.4    |
| 2023-2025  | -8.0%   | 82.6% | -67.0% | -0.0 | 1.2    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Consistently negative Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) indicates poor annual returns over the specified periods.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values suggest significant potential losses for investors during these periods.
*   **Alpha:** Negative alpha values mean that SDGR underperformed its benchmark index.
*   **Beta:** A low beta value (close to zero or negative) indicates that the stock's price is not very sensitive to movements in the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $16.47
*   **Previous Close:** $16.33
*   **Change:** 0.86%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 16.824
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 18.8535
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 19.5052

**Analysis:** The price shows a slight increase compared to the previous close, but the current price is below all the moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day and 60-day, further confirming the downward trend.

**3. Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 17.52 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.52
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (47 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** 1.5 (+)
*   **Expected Return:** -4185.5%

**Analysis:**

*   The **RSI** indicates that the stock is oversold, potentially suggesting a buying opportunity.
*   The **PPO** indicates the position of a moving average relative to another moving average and can be used as a divergence/convergence indicator.
*   The **MRI** suggests a medium investment recommendation.
*   The **Hybrid Signal** suggests that the model recommends buying.
*   The **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence** indicates short-term improvement relative to the benchmark.
*   However, the extremely negative **Expected Return** suggests significant risks and potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. **This is a major red flag.**

The relatively high "change" value (`{'price': 16.47, 'previousClose': 16.33, 'change': 0.86}`) suggests a recent minor price movement, but not a dramatic event that would require special attention in this analysis.

**4. Recent News & Events**

*   Several articles highlight a potential "buy the bottom" scenario for SDGR.
*   News covers Schrodinger's progress on the Neptune project and presentations at healthcare conferences.
*   Earnings reports indicate revenue growth but continued losses.

**Analysis:** The news suggests a mixed outlook. While some sources see a potential turnaround, the underlying financial performance (earnings reports) remains a concern.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.67)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: $27.22, High: $33.00, Low: $18.00

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is leaning towards a "Buy" rating with a significant upside potential based on the average target price. However, it's important to note the wide range in target prices, indicating uncertainty among analysts.

**7. Overall Analysis and Conclusion**

Schrodinger (SDGR) presents a complex picture.

*   **Negative Factors:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, consistently negative EPS and ROE, decreasing equity, and a very negative expected return are all major concerns. The high MDD values indicate that it has a history of major drawdowns.
*   **Positive Factors:**  Oversold RSI, recent positive price movement, analyst "Buy" consensus, and news suggesting a potential "bottom." The company's high profit margin.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data, **SDGR is a high-risk investment.** While there are signals that *might* suggest a potential turnaround, the fundamental financial performance is weak, and the stock has significantly underperformed the market.  The extremely negative expected return is a serious warning sign. While analysts have a buy recommendation, the large range in price targets also suggest that there is a lot of uncertainty on whether it can actually turn around. Any investment decision should be made with caution, considering the potential for further losses. A "buy the bottom" strategy would be very speculative in this case.
