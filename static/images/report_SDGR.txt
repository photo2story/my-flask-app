**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Consistently negative or very low positive growth across the periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Very high drawdowns indicate significant volatility and downside risk.  The MDD is consistently above 78%, reaching over 80% in some periods.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha means the stock has underperformed its benchmark after accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:** The betas close to zero suggest that the stock's price is not highly correlated with the market.
*   **Cap:** The company capitalization is in the billions.

**Analysis:** This data paints a picture of a volatile stock with poor performance relative to the market. The negative alpha indicates the company has not provided returns commensurate with the risk taken. The high MDD underscores the potential for significant losses.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** $18.31
*   **Previous Close:** $18.38
*   **Change:** -$0.38
*   **5-day SMA:** $18.51
*   **20-day SMA:** $17.8955
*   **60-day SMA:** $18.9508

**Analysis:** The stock price has recently decreased slightly. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is a potentially bullish sign in the short term, but the 60-day SMA is higher than both, suggesting a possible downtrend in the medium term.

**3) Indicators and Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - This is very surprising given the poor performance data and should be viewed with extreme caution and considered in the context of other data.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 56.69 - Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.839 - Suggests a positive momentum, but not strongly overbought.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (58 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01) - The Hybrid Signal is bullish, recommending buying with all available cash, and considers the stock very safe with a high MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -0.7 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -5407.7 - A drastically negative expected return is highly concerning, but may be an aberration of the model with the data supplied.

**Analysis:** The MRI's recommendation of "High Investment Recommended" contradicts the negative performance and negative expected return. While the RSI and PPO don't indicate extreme conditions, the negative divergence change suggests recent downward pressure. The drastically negative expected return is a major red flag.

**Analysis:**  The recent news headlines present a mixed picture.  Several articles suggest a potential "buy the bottom" opportunity, implying the stock is currently undervalued. Other articles focus on positive price movements and analyst upgrades. However, these positive sentiments need to be weighed against the negative financial performance highlighted earlier. "Unlocking Hidden Value" and "Strategic Shift Toward Software" articles suggest potential catalysts for future growth, but they are forward-looking and not guarantees.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Strong Buy" with a significant average target price above the current price. This suggests analysts see substantial upside potential.  However, it's important to consider the range of target prices, as the low target is close to the current price. The absence of specifics on rating changes makes it difficult to assess the direction of recent analyst sentiment shifts.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Performance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The CAGR and Alpha analysis confirm underperformance and high volatility.  Negative EPS and ROE underscore the company's current lack of profitability.
*   **Contradictory Indicators:**  The MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" status, which conflicts with the negative financial metrics. The Hybrid signal is bullish, also contradicting the financials.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts have a "Strong Buy" consensus with a substantial average target price, implying significant upside potential.
*   **Mixed News:** Recent news headlines are mixed, with some promoting a "buy the bottom" narrative while others highlight positive price movements.
*   **Financial Concerns:** Declining equity and negative ROE are significant causes for concern.
*   **Unusual Data Point**: The Expected Return (%) of -5407.7 is a drastically negative, which should be examined with caution.

**Conclusion:**  Investing in SDGR is a high-risk proposition. While analysts are optimistic and some news articles suggest a potential turnaround, the company's negative financial performance, high volatility, and the conflicting signals from the MRI warrant extreme caution.  Further due diligence is absolutely essential, focusing on the reasons behind the analyst's bullish outlook and the potential catalysts for a turnaround, while also carefully considering the significant financial risks. The recommendation is that the MRI and Hybrid signal should be ignored given the poor financial results and negative expected return.
