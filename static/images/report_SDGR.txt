**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

* **Return Difference:** -73.6%  (SDGR underperformed VOO by 73.6 percentage points.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 15.3% (This indicates SDGR's underperformance is relatively less extreme compared to its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500.)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently negative alpha values, indicating SDGR underperformed the market benchmark, and high beta values suggesting high volatility and correlation with the broader market. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates, with negative values in earlier periods and positive in later periods, implying a turnaround attempt, although recent performance doesn't reflect significant market-beating returns.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0% | 68.9% | -82.0% | 1.4 |  |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with consistently negative alpha and high beta.  While recent price action shows some short-term upward movement, the company's financial performance, including negative EPS and ROE, raises serious concerns. The extremely negative projected return (-317.9%) requires careful scrutiny of the calculation methodology.  Further investigation into the company's long-term growth prospects and the viability of its business model is crucial before considering any investment.  The high profit margins despite negative EPS and ROE warrant further investigation to understand the accounting practices.  This stock carries substantial risk and should only be considered by investors with a high tolerance for risk and a deep understanding of the company's business model and future prospects.  The duplicate entry in the earnings report also needs clarification.
