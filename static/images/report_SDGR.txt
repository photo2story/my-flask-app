The relative divergence of 0.0% indicates SDGR is at the very bottom of its historical divergence range compared to VOO.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    | Year        | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
    | ----------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ------ |
    | 2020-2022   | -74.0% | 68.9%  | -89.0% | -0.1 | 1.4    |
    | 2021-2023   | -65.0% | 68.9%  | -83.0% | -0.0 | 2.6    |
    | 2022-2024   | 8.0%   | 72.4%  | -17.0% | -0.0 | 1.4    |
    | 2023-2025   | -1.0%  | 74.0%  | -53.0% | -0.0 | 1.5    |

*   **Analysis:** The table reveals several concerning trends:
    *   **Negative CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is negative for most periods, indicating a decline in investment value over time. The single positive CAGR (8% for 2022-2024) may indicate a short-term recovery but is insufficient to offset overall losses.
    *   **High MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, ranging from 68.9% to 74.0%. This suggests significant volatility and risk, as investors could lose a large portion of their investment during downturns.
    *   **Negative Alpha:** Alpha is consistently negative, indicating that SDGR has underperformed relative to its benchmark (S&P 500) even after adjusting for risk. This suggests the company-specific factors are negatively impacting returns.
    *   **Beta Close to Zero:** Beta values are very close to zero, suggesting that SDGR's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market. This can be viewed as both a positive and a negative, as it provides some insulation during market downturns, but it also means SDGR is not benefiting as much during market upturns.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $20.05
*   **Previous Close:** $19.375
*   **Change:** 3.48%
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day MA: 19.513
    *   20-day MA: 20.4192
    *   60-day MA: 21.3506

*   **Analysis:**  The current price is above the 5-day moving average but below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. The large positive change of 3.48% indicates a recent bounce. However, the longer-term moving averages being higher suggests that the stock is still in a downtrend, and this could just be a temporary retracement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3285 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 40.43
*   **PPO:** 0.0161
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_7%_Buy 90% of cash (943 shares - Safe - MRI:0.33)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (Negative, indicates short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -6144.3%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a relatively low-risk market environment overall, but this needs to be viewed in the context of SDGR's specific performance.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 40.43 is near the oversold territory but not quite there. It suggests the stock may be losing downward momentum but is not yet a strong buy signal.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO is close to zero, indicating that the shorter moving average is nearly equal to the longer moving average. This could signal a consolidation phase.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The recommendation to buy 90% of cash is categorized as "Safe", and is based on the MRI.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent underperformance.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extraordinarily large negative expected return (-6144.3%) is highly unusual. The value is not realistic, and there may have been an error.
    *   **Price Change:** Given the +3.48% price change, the stock shows signs of short-term upward momentum, potentially indicating a near-term recovery.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

**7. 종합적인 분석**

SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and shows several concerning trends. It has negative CAGR, high MDD, and negative Alpha, indicating underperformance. A recent price bounce might be a temporary retracement in a longer-term downtrend. The company is not profitable, and the equity is decreasing. Market Risk Indicator is low, but the expected return is extremely negative. Investors should monitor recent news and company announcements closely due to the ongoing volatility and business developments.

In summary, based on the data provided, SDGR appears to be a high-risk investment at this time. The negative financial metrics and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrant significant caution.
