It should be investigated further. The Hybrid Signal suggests a strong buy recommendation based on the current indicators.
*   **Impact of Last Market Data:** The last market data shows a slight negative change, but it's not significant enough to indicate a major reversal of the trend.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** Revenue has fluctuated but generally remained in a relatively narrow range. Profit margins are high, suggesting good cost control on sales, but the overall negative EPS from the previous section indicates that operating expenses are still too high.
    *   **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has been decreasing, indicating a potential erosion of the company's asset base. Negative ROE (Return on Equity) confirms the unprofitability and poor return on shareholder investments.

**7. 종합적으로 분석(Overall Analysis)**

SDGR presents a mixed investment picture.

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, consistent losses (negative EPS and ROE), decreasing equity, and a very risky investment (historical analysis).
*   **Positives:** Strong analyst consensus (Buy rating), high profit margins on revenue, potential upside based on target prices, high MRI score suggesting an opportune entry point, and upcoming catalysts in the form of earnings announcements.

**Conclusion:**

SDGR is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The stock is currently beaten down, but analysts see potential for a turnaround. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and rewards before investing. The long-term expected return should be validated with accurate calculations. Consider the recommendation of Hybrid Signal for long-term investment.
