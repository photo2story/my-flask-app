**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) is a biotechnology company focused on drug discovery using physics-based simulations.  The company significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return difference of -77.2%. This places it at the 12.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistently negative alpha across the periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values further highlight the significant risk associated with investing in SDGR.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0% | 68.9% | -82.0% | -0.1 | 1.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0% | 68.9% | -73.0% | -0.1 | 2.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0% | 72.4% | -7.0% | -0.1 | 1.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 7.0% | 73.6% | -0.4 | 1.8 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price is slightly below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  The price is above the 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.  The recent price increase of $0.13 suggests minor positive momentum, but it's not a significant rebound considering the overall downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 37.75 is below 50, suggesting the stock is currently in oversold territory. The negative PPO (-1.34) confirms the bearish trend. The recent relative divergence of -3.4 indicates a short-term downward trend. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.37 suggests a medium risk level.  The expected return of -402.7% is exceptionally negative and likely reflects the significant historical underperformance and high risk.  This does not indicate a realistic expectation for future returns.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy should consider the extreme downside risk and lack of outperformance versus the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company consistently reported negative EPS and low revenue figures.  There's no clear sign of improving financial performance in the provided data.  Further investigation into the underlying causes of these losses is needed.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-05-07 | -0.82 | 0.06 B$ |
| 2024-11-12 | -0.52 | 0.04 B$ |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation but remains relatively low.  Profit margins are generally high but are unsustainable given the negative EPS and ROE. The negative ROE across all quarters indicates the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B | 72.61% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR has significantly underperformed the market, showing consistently negative alpha and high risk as evidenced by the large maximum drawdown.  Financial statements reveal ongoing losses despite relatively high profit margins (which are likely unsustainable).  While the current price is near oversold territory (RSI), the fundamental weakness and negative outlook outweigh this technical signal.  A long-term investment in SDGR carries considerable risk and requires a thorough understanding of the company's prospects for future profitability and market competitiveness.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before considering any investment.
