**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------- |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.45 | 0.05 B$    |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.59 | 0.05 B$    |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.82 | 0.06 B$    |
| 2024-11-12 | -0.52 | 0.04 B$    |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.52 | 0.04 B$    |

**Analysis:**  The company has consistently reported negative EPS, indicating profitability challenges.  Revenue has fluctuated slightly but hasn't shown substantial growth. The two different reports on "2025-11-05" need to be examined further for discrepancies.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------- |
| 2025-09-30   | $0.05B  | 51.61%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.05B  | 47.77%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.06B  | 52.26%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.09B  | 72.61%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.04B  | 50.24%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity | ROE       |
| ------------ | ------ | --------- |
| 2025-09-30   | $0.32B | -10.21%  |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.34B | -12.59%  |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.37B | -16.01%  |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.42B | -9.54%   |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.45B | -8.49%   |

**Analysis:** While revenue has been inconsistent, the profit margins show consistent profitability on those sales.  However, the consistently negative Return on Equity (ROE) indicates that the company is not effectively generating profit from shareholders' investments.  Furthermore, equity is steadily decreasing, potentially signaling financial difficulties or share buybacks.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Schrodinger (SDGR) presents a mixed investment picture.  The stock has significantly underperformed the broader market, reflecting negative Alpha and a substantial divergence from the S&P 500.  The company's persistent negative EPS and ROE raise concerns about its profitability and efficient use of shareholder equity. Revenue is not consistent.

However, positive analyst price targets suggest potential upside, and recent news includes "Buy the Bottom" recommendations.  The MRI indicates a medium investment risk. Analyst target suggests a price increase.

**Investment Recommendation:**

The data suggests a *high-risk* investment. While there are positive signals like analyst price targets and some positive news, the company's financial performance and market underperformance cannot be ignored. Potential investors should conduct extensive due diligence, understanding the "complex story" surrounding the company. Proceed with extreme caution. A small allocation aligned with high-risk tolerance might be considered if the investor believes in the company's long-term potential and the validity of the positive analyst outlook. It is recommended to check for discrepancies in the data (the 2025-11-05 earnings reports).
