*   **Expected Return (%):** -5407.7%

**Analysis:**

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. Some articles suggest a "Buy the Bottom" opportunity and analyst upgrades, indicating some positive sentiment. However, the "Hold" consensus rating and the "Complex Story" headline highlight the uncertainty and potential risks associated with the stock. Recent upgrades and price targets provide some optimism, but must be viewed cautiously given the company's recent performance.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Strong Buy (Mean: 1.44 based on 9 opinions)
*   **Target Price:** Average: $27.22, High: $33.00, Low: $18.00

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is "Strong Buy," which contrasts with the stock's poor historical performance. The average target price of $27.22 suggests significant upside potential from the current price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty among analysts. This needs to be weighed against the negative financial indicators like low alpha and negative return.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

**Analysis:**

*   **Positive Factors:** The recent analyst upgrades and a strong buy consensus indicates potential for future growth. A positive price change also suggests some recovery signs.
*   **Overall:** While some analysts have a positive outlook, the company's financial performance is concerning. The stock carries significant risk, and investment should be approached with caution. Investors need to carefully consider the company's long-term prospects and its ability to achieve profitability.
