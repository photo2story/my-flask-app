**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** $20.59
*   **Previous Close:** $21.45
*   **Change:** -4.01%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 20.58
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 19.46
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 20.01

**Analysis:** The stock price decreased by 4.01% in the last trading session. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which could indicate a short-term upward trend, but the recent price drop tempers this signal.

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 2.4 (Positive - Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -1733% (Significant underperformance vs S&P 500 in long term)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment risk. The RSI is approaching overbought levels, suggesting potential for a pullback. The positive PPO indicates potential upward momentum. The hybrid signal recommends a buy with monthly investment. The very negative expected return is concerning and indicates a potential lack of long-term investment return. The recent price drop (-4.01%) reflects the volatility in the stock.
