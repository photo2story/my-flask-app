|------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|

**Analysis:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed. The large negative return disparity confirms this. The relative disparity suggests the current underperformance is near the worst it has been historically compared to the S&P 500, but the historical context is limited without more data.
*   **Negative Alpha:**  The consistently negative alpha values across all periods indicate that SDGR is underperforming relative to its risk-adjusted expected return based on the market. This means the stock is not generating excess returns.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values close to 0 indicate SDGR stock’s volatility has a very weak correlation to the market, suggesting it isn't strongly influenced by overall market movements, according to these numbers.
*   **High MDD:**  The very high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures reveal substantial risk. Investors experienced significant losses from peak to trough during these periods.
*   **Declining CAGR:**  Negative Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) values mean the investment is generally losing money over time.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** $19.595
*   **Last Market Change:** Price: $19.595, Previous Close: $20.04, Change: -2.22%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** $19.211
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $19.1187
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $20.0465

**Analysis:**

*   **Recent Price Decline:** The stock closed down 2.22% in the last market session, indicating recent selling pressure.
*   **Moving Average Convergence:** The 5-day and 20-day moving averages are very close, suggesting a lack of strong trend. The price is below the 60-day moving average, which could be seen as a short-term bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 51.27
*   **PPO:** 0.4657
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (52 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02)
*   **Recent (20-Day) Relative Disparity Change:** 0.1 (+) - Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return (%):** -6605.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.9 suggests a medium-risk investment according to this indicator, which is contradictory to the historical return performance.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is near neutral (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO being slightly positive suggests a weak upward trend, but the value is low.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Despite the negative outlook, the hybrid signal gives the "Buy" signal.
*   **Recent Disparity Change:**  The slight increase in relative disparity over the last 20 days suggests a small recent improvement compared to the S&P 500, but it's from a low base.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is highly concerning.  It implies a very pessimistic long-term outlook, potentially indicating the model predicts severe continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500. Given the magnitude, this value needs careful verification.
*   **Price Change Reflection:** The price change of -2.22% is reflected in the neutral RSI, indicating that the indicator has not entered oversold territory yet despite the price decline.

The analyst expectation of a rally is positive, but needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The conference presentation is also neutral.

*   **Declining Equity:** Equity is trending downward, which is concerning.
*   **Negative ROE:**  The negative Return on Equity (ROE) reflects the company's inability to generate profits from shareholders' investments.
*   **Fluctuating Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates, and while profit margins are high, they are not high enough to offset costs and generate profit.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Based on the data provided, Schrodinger (SDGR) presents a mixed picture with significant cause for concern:

*   **Poor Historical Performance:**  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative cumulative return and a consistently negative alpha.
*   **High Risk:** The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial volatility and risk.
*   **Unprofitability:**  The company is consistently unprofitable, as evidenced by negative EPS and ROE. Equity is decreasing.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** There are conflicting signals from different indicators. Analysts have a "Buy" consensus and positive price targets, which contrast sharply with the negative expected return and poor financial performance. The Hybrid Signal says "Buy" but the MRI says "medium risk" which contradicts the high risks shown by negative historical returns.
*   **Recent News:** Recent news is a mix of potentially negative (discontinued program) and neutral announcements.

**Recommendation:**

Given the strong concerns about profitability, historical underperformance, high risk, and the conflicting signals from various sources, a **cautious approach** is warranted. A deeper dive into the reasons for the discrepancies between analyst opinions and the model's expected return is crucial. Further research on the company's future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and cash flow situation is also necessary before making any investment decisions. The company needs to show a clear path to profitability and improved performance relative to the market before it can be considered an attractive investment.
