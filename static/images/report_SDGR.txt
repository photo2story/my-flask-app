**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0%  | 68.9%  | -92.0%  | -0.0  | 1.4    |

| 2023-2025  | 7.0%   | 73.6%  | -22.0%  | -0.1  | 1.7    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Consistently negative CAGR values from 2020-2023 suggest significant losses over these periods. However, the CAGR turns positive in the more recent 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods, indicating a potential turnaround or recovery in stock performance.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values are high, reflecting significant volatility and downside risk in the stock. The consistently high MDD indicates that investors have experienced substantial declines from peak values during these periods.
*   **Alpha:** The negative alpha values indicate that the stock has underperformed relative to its benchmark index (typically a market index like the S&P 500). The magnitude of the negative alpha is particularly high in the earlier periods (2020-2022, 2021-2023), suggesting significant underperformance during those times.
*   **Beta:** The beta values are relatively low, close to zero. This suggests that the stock's price movements have not been strongly correlated with the overall market. A beta close to zero may indicate that the stock is relatively insensitive to market fluctuations.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization values are in the range of 1.4 to 2.6 billion dollars.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** $23.76

*   **Change:** -1.7%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** $23.89
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $25.15
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $22.77

**Analysis:** The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  However, the price is above the 60-day moving average, indicating that the longer-term trend might still be positive, or at least less negative. The negative change of -1.7% from the previous close indicates a recent dip.

### 3. Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.35 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 38.13
*   **PPO:** -1.36
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -5.4 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -614.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A low MRI suggests the overall market risk is currently considered low.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 38.13 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), suggesting the stock *may* be due for a potential bounce, but it is not yet definitively oversold.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downward trend.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-614.1%) is highly concerning and suggests that, based on the model used,  long-term investment in SDGR is predicted to significantly underperform the S&P 500. This should be taken with caution, as models are not always accurate.

The price change being down 1.7% from the previous close indicates a recent downward pressure. This volatility should be considered in the overall analysis.

**Analysis:**

*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been decreasing over the quarters, which is a potential concern. Negative ROE values indicate that the company is not generating profit from shareholder equity, aligning with the EPS analysis.

### 7. Overall Analysis & Summary

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) is currently facing significant challenges. It has underperformed the S&P 500, with a large divergence.  The stock exhibits high volatility, and recent earnings reports show continued losses. While revenue exists, it doesn't translate into profitability. Decreasing equity and negative ROE values are also concerning. Recent news events suggest increased market attention and volatility.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Underperformance:**  The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns about the company's ability to generate returns.
*   **Profitability:**  Consistent negative EPS and ROE values highlight the urgent need for the company to improve profitability.
*   **Volatility:**  High volatility makes SDGR a potentially risky investment, especially for risk-averse investors.
*   **Financials:** Declining equity is a signal that could hint that the company might need to raise further capital.

**Overall Recommendation:** Based on this analysis, a cautious approach to investing in SDGR is warranted. Investors should closely monitor the company's financial performance, news announcements, and industry trends before making any investment decisions. The extremely negative expected return warrants serious concern and further investigation.
