**Analysis:** SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period. The large negative difference in accumulated returns indicates substantial underperformance. The Relative Divergence of 3.4 suggests that SDGR is currently near the lower end of its historical divergence range from VOO.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|------|-------|------|--------|

| 2021-2023  | -57.0% | 81.0% | -59.0% | -0.0 | 2.6    |
| 2022-2024  | 6.0%  | 81.0% | -14.0% | -0.0 | 1.4    |
| 2023-2025  | 1.0%  | 82.6% | -62.0% | -0.0 | 1.5    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  SDGR has struggled with negative CAGR across all periods, except for a slight positive change in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Very high MDD indicates substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha values suggest underperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500).
*   **Beta:** A Beta close to 0 suggests a very low correlation with the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** $20.59
*   **Previous Close:** $21.45
*   **Change:** -4.01%
*   **5-day MA:** 20.58
*   **20-day MA:** 19.46
*   **60-day MA:** 20.01

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but above the 20-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term upward momentum. However, the recent price drop of 4.01% indicates a possible shift in sentiment.

**3. Market Risk Indicator & Technical Indicators**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 68.39 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 1.30
*   **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** 2.4 (+) - Short-term increase in divergence.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1733.0 (Very negative long-term expected return relative to S&P 500)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (47 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.4% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)"

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests high investment recommendation, while the RSI nearing 70 indicates the stock is approaching overbought conditions.  The positive change in relative divergence suggests recent short-term outperformance compared to its historical trend. The sharply negative expected return is a significant concern. The Hybrid Signal suggests a strategy of investing all available cash and continuing to invest a small amount monthly, framing the investment as "very safe." Given the other data points, "very safe" appears to be an overstatement. The price change of -4.01% is a significant drop and should be noted as a potential indicator of increased volatility or negative news impacting the stock.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **2025-09-18:** Inducement Grants under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4)
*   **2025-09-11:** Evaluating Valuation as Market Sentiment Remains Quiet
*   **2025-09-09:** Potential to Rally 40.43% (Analyst Expectation)
*   **2025-08-27:** Presentation at Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference
*   **2025-08-14:** Discontinuation of SGR-2921 Program

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. The inducement grants are generally neutral. The valuation evaluation suggests uncertainty. An analyst expectation of a potential rally is positive. The conference presentation could be a positive catalyst. However, the discontinuation of the SGR-2921 program is negative, suggesting a setback in their pipeline.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.56)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: $27.20 / High: $33.00 / Low: $19.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent rating changes are listed.

**Analysis:** Analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on the stock with an average target price significantly higher than the current price.  This suggests analysts see potential upside, but it's important to remember that target prices are not guarantees.

**7. Summary and Conclusion**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative CAGR and ROE, high MDD, consistently negative EPS, a very concerning long-term negative expected return relative to the S&P 500, and a recent program discontinuation.
*   **Positives:** High MRI, Analyst "Buy" consensus, strong profit margins, some potential for short-term upward momentum based on moving averages, and analyst target prices suggesting substantial upside.

**Overall:** SDGR appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment. While analysts are generally positive and there is potential for a rally, the company's lack of profitability, negative long-term expected return, and underperformance relative to the market are serious concerns. The recent price drop should also be a warning sign. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in SDGR. The "very safe" characterization of the hybrid signal is misleading and should be disregarded in light of the other data.
