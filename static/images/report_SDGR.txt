*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is very high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The consistently negative Alpha suggests that SDGR has underperformed relative to its benchmark index (S&P 500) and what would be predicted by its beta.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is consistently very low or zero, suggesting the stock's price is not correlated with the S&P 500. This is not necessarily a good thing, as it suggests that the stock's returns are not tied to the overall market performance.

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three simple moving averages (SMA), indicating a potential downtrend.

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI is close to the neutral level, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The PPO is slightly positive, indicating that the short-term moving average is a bit higher than the long-term moving average, but it is still close to the neutral point.
*   The hybrid signal is "Buy", suggesting the system believes SDGR has reached a bottom.
*   The negative change in divergence is pointing to short term decline.
*   The extraordinarily negative "Expected Return" is concerning, indicating a potential for large losses if investing based on the model.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Focus on Valuation & Bottom Buying:** Several articles highlight that Schrodinger is a potential "buy the bottom" stock and focus on valuation following revenue and guidance updates.
*   **Institutional Interest:** Capital Fund Management S.A. has taken a position in Schrodinger.
*   **Market Wrap:** Mentions SDGR's performance in rate cut cycles.
*   **"Unlocking Hidden Value":** An article suggesting potential value remains within the company.
*   **SDGR stock is up 14% today:** This recent positive movement is worth noting and seems to contradict the prevailing negative sentiment and technical indicators.

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. While some articles suggest potential value and institutional interest, the overall tone seems cautious, focusing on valuation and bottom-fishing strategies. The recent price jump (up 14%) is a positive development, but it needs to be seen in the context of the overall downtrend.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.67 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Target Price:** Average: $27.22, High: $33.00, Low: $18.00

**Analysis:** Despite the poor performance, analysts maintain a "Buy" rating with a significant upside potential implied by the average target price. It's important to note the wide range between the high and low target prices, suggesting uncertainty among analysts. The missing data for Recent Rating Changes makes it impossible to see the trends in analyst opinion.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Performance:** SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The trend is confirmed in the Alpha, Beta Analysis section, with the CAGR consistently negative and Alpha underperforming. The stock's price is below its moving averages.
*   **Financial Challenges:** The company is experiencing negative EPS and negative ROE.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Recent news suggests some positive developments (institutional interest, focus on value), but caution is warranted.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Reality:** Analysts have a "Buy" rating with a significant upside potential, but this contrasts with the company's recent financial performance and the technical indicators. This discrepancy raises the question if analysts' optimistic reviews are outdated.
*   **Very High Risk:** High MDD, and negative expected return.

**Conclusion:** Based on this analysis, investing in SDGR is high-risk. While analysts see potential upside, the company's financial performance, underperformance relative to the market, and negative technical indicators raise significant concerns. The recent jump in price is a welcome sign for investors, but is not sufficient to change the general picture. The fact that some funds might be building a position is interesting, but requires more investigation. Further due diligence is strongly recommended.
