Schrodinger Inc. is a company focused on the application of physics-based computational methods to drug discovery.  As shown above, SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. The cumulative return difference of -68.3% highlights this substantial underperformance.  The relative divergence suggests that while significantly underperforming, this level of underperformance is within the observed historical range.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows negative alpha across all periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark. The beta fluctuates, generally between 1.4 and 2.6, suggesting higher volatility than the overall market (beta of 1).  The positive CAGR in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 suggests some recovery, but this is still overshadowed by significant prior losses.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -74.0% | 68.9% | -82.0% | 1.4 |  |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0% | 68.9% | -73.0% | 2.6 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0%   | 72.4% | -7.0% | 1.4 |  |

* **5-day Moving Average:** $25.90
* **20-day Moving Average:** $22.09
* **60-day Moving Average:** $22.81

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it's still below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The recent price change of 2.63% (from $25.46) suggests a recent price jump which needs further investigation.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 75.67 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for price correction)
* **PPO:** 2.54 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.0% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -235.1% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term raises serious concerns.)

The relatively high RSI and significant negative expected return raise concerns about potential future price declines. The recent price increase might be a temporary rebound.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative EPS over the past several quarters, indicating ongoing losses. Revenue remains relatively flat and low. This is not a promising picture for financial health.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |

**5) Financial Information:**

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with consistently negative EPS and a very negative outlook. While some short-term indicators suggest a potential rebound, the overall financial picture is concerning.  The negative expected return is a major red flag.  The high profit margins suggest potential for profitability given revenue increases, but current earnings data is worrying.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution, and extensive further due diligence is strongly recommended before any investment consideration. A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) at this point would be particularly risky given the current data.
