**Analysis:** SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). The large negative alpha indicates that SDGR is not generating returns independent of the market.  The beta values are close to zero or negative, suggesting a very weak or inverse correlation with the market. The high MDD(Maximum Drawdown) values indicate significant volatility and risk.  The CAGR has been negative over the past, indicating value destruction over those periods. The capitalization size is relatively small.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movements**

*   **Current Price:** $24.17
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: $24.17
    *   Previous Close: $23.91
    *   Change: 1.09%
*   **Moving Averages:**

    *   20-day MA: $25.2932
    *   60-day MA: $22.7832

**Analysis:** The stock price is above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages but below the 20-day moving average.  The 1.09% increase from the previous close indicates a minor positive move in the very short term.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3676 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 37.50 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -1.3425
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -7.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -553.4%

**Analysis:** The RSI value suggests the stock may be approaching oversold conditions, which could indicate a potential buying opportunity, but it can stay oversold for an extended time. The negative PPO indicates the 20-day EMA is below the 60-day EMA. The negative change in relative divergence confirms recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The "Low Risk" MRI seems contradictory given other indicators and past performance.  The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting significant long-term concerns. The 1.09% change in price reflects a minor positive shift, but the overall trend remains negative.
