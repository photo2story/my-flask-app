**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Schrodinger Inc (SDGR) shows substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with consistently negative EPS and ROE. Although some short-term technical indicators suggest potential upward momentum, the negative expected return, high MDD, and the overall negative financial picture present a highly concerning outlook.  The data suggests high risk and a low likelihood of outperforming the market in the long term.  Further investigation is crucial before making any investment decisions,  especially considering the -206.4% predicted long-term return.  The duplicated earnings data entry needs to be corrected and clarified.
