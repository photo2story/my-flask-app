**Schrodinger Inc. (SDGR) Analysis**

**Company Overview:** Schrodinger Inc. is a company focused on developing software for drug discovery and materials science.

**1. Return Rate Comparison & Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

*   **SDGR Cumulative Return:** -59.60%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 62.95%
*   **Divergence:** -122.6 (Relative Divergence: 2.1)

This significant negative divergence suggests that SDGR has severely underperformed the overall market represented by the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 2.1 indicates that the current divergence is very close to the minimum divergence within the data period.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|---------|--------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | -8.0% | 82.6% | -67.0% | -0.0   | 1.2   |

*   **CAGR:** Consistently negative Compound Annual Growth Rate over all periods indicates poor investment returns.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown figures (around 80%) point to substantial risk and price volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The highly negative Alpha indicates significant underperformance relative to the market, even considering market movements. It means the stock's return is far lower than what would be predicted based on the market's return.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates around 0, meaning that, in general, the investment does not correlate with the S\&P500.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **20-day SMA:** 18.85
*   **60-day SMA:** 19.51

The stock price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downward trend. The small positive change compared to the previous close might be a sign of a weak rebound, but it's not yet a strong reversal signal.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

SDGR has significantly underperformed the market. The stock is currently in a downtrend, and recent financial data shows consistent losses and declining equity. While the RSI indicates an oversold condition and analysts maintain a "Buy" rating with a substantial upside target price, this optimism contrasts with the company's negative earnings, declining equity, and significant underperformance.

The recent news highlights both concerns about valuation and potential positive developments. The future prospects of SDGR appear uncertain. The negative expected return and low MRI suggest to be cautious. However, the fact that the "Hybrid Signal" indicates that the stock is worth a buy and "Very Safe" indicates that the models might indicate the need to buy more shares.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, **caution is advised**. While the oversold condition, analyst ratings, and potential positive developments could present an opportunity, the company's financial performance and market underperformance are significant red flags. A thorough risk assessment is crucial before considering any investment in SDGR. Investors should carefully evaluate the company's long-term prospects and consider whether the potential rewards outweigh the significant risks.
