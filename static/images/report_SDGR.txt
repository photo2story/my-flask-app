| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -73.0% | 69.2% | -106.0% | 0.1 | 1.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -71.0% | 69.2% | -99.0% | -0.1 | 2.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 12.0% | 72.4% | -4.0% | -0.2 | 1.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 5.0% | 73.6% | -0.5 | 1.3 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of SDGR ($18.03) is below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a downward trend. The recent decline of -4.45 from the previous close suggests a short-term bearish sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (20.56):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce but not guaranteeing it.
* **PPO (-1.60):**  Shows a negative momentum, confirming the bearish trend.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+7.6):** Suggests a short-term upward trend despite the overall downward movement.
* **Expected Return (-293.8%):** This extremely negative expected return highlights the significant risk and potential for further losses.  This needs further clarification.  It seems unusually low, is this compared to VOO?  Is there a time horizon specified for this expectation?

The significant negative change (-4.45) from the previous close suggests a sharp decline.  The high market risk indicator (MRI of 0.46, approaching high-risk territory) further supports this concern.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

SDGR has consistently reported negative EPS and relatively low revenue over the past several quarters.  There is no clear sign of significant improvement in profitability.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -0.52 | $0.04 B      |
| 2024-07-31 | -0.74 | $0.05 B      |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.76 | $0.04 B      |

| 2024-11-12 | -0.86 | $0.04 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation, but profitability is unstable as well, showing both high and low profit margins in different quarters.  Equally concerning is the negative Return on Equity (ROE) across all reported quarters, which reflects poor profitability relative to shareholder equity.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.09B | 72.61% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative EPS, inconsistent revenue, and negative ROE.  Technical indicators show oversold conditions, but the overall trend remains bearish.  The extremely negative expected return and high market risk underscore significant investment risk.  Before considering any investment, a thorough examination of SDGR's future prospects, including its pipeline and strategic plans, is crucial.  The current data points to a high-risk, potentially losing investment.  The -293.8% expected return requires further explanation and clarification.  A long-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold strategy might be considered *only* if there is strong belief in a substantial turnaround in the company's fundamentals and a significant reduction in the high level of risk.
