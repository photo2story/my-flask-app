| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B      | -5.59%        |

*Analysis:*  While profit margins appear relatively high at times, this is likely due to the small revenue base.  The consistently negative ROE reflects the company's overall unprofitability and declining equity.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR exhibits significant risk and volatility.  While the recent price increase and positive short-term indicators might be interpreted as a short-term bounce, the long-term outlook remains considerably negative.  The company is unprofitable, has a consistently negative alpha, and faces significant downside risk compared to the broader market.  The extremely negative long-term expected return projection needs careful consideration.  A potential investment requires careful evaluation of the company's long-term prospects and risk tolerance.  The provided data strongly suggests that SDGR is a high-risk investment, potentially unsuitable for risk-averse investors.
