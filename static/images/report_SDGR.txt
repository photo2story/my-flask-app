**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data severely limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This lack of information is a major concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SDGR's performance has been significantly poor compared to the S&P 500, with consistently negative EPS and revenue growth raising serious concerns.  Technical indicators show mixed signals, but the bearish momentum and substantial negative expected return are alarming. The missing financial data prevents a thorough evaluation.  Before considering any investment, further investigation into the company's fundamentals, the validity of the -317.9% expected return, and the reasons for the missing financial data is crucial.  The high risk profile, as evidenced by the MDD and beta, should be carefully considered.  At present, SDGR appears to be a high-risk, low-reward investment.
