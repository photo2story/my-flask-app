    *   RSI: 52.25

    *   Recent (20-Day) Relative Disparity Change: -3.4 (Negative - Short-Term Decline)
    *   Expected Return (%): -6232.1
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI indicates a "Medium Investment Recommended" rating, but it's important to note that this is just one indicator.
    *   The RSI (52.25) is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
    *   The negative PPO (-0.45) suggests a slight downward trend.
    *   The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy signal, allocating all cash to buy 47 shares, but it is classified as "very safe" with an MRI of 0.9, which contradicts the actual performance.
    *   The negative change in relative disparity (-3.4) confirms a recent short-term decline.
    *   The extremely negative expected return (-6232.1%) is highly concerning and could indicate a significant potential for underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term if these projections hold true.
    *   The change of -1.46% shows downward price pressure.

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has fluctuated, with a peak in Q4 2024. Profit margins are relatively high, indicating good cost control on sales. However, the company's ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, suggesting that the company is not generating profits from its equity. Also, the company's equity is declining.

**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

SDGR has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and shows concerning financial trends. While analyst consensus suggests a "Buy" rating with substantial upside potential, the negative EPS, negative ROE, and high MDD raise significant concerns. The recent news is mixed, and technical indicators are not strongly supportive. While the hybrid signal gives a buy signal with high safety, past performance and the negative outlook must be considered.

**Summary of Key Concerns:**

*   **Poor Performance:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Profitability:** Consistent negative EPS and ROE.
*   **High Risk:** High maximum drawdown.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Conflicting signals from analyst ratings and technical indicators.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** Very concerning long-term return projection.
*   **Equity Decline:** The company's equity is declining.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the current data, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should carefully weigh the potential upside suggested by analysts against the significant risks and negative financial trends. More research is needed to assess the long-term viability of the company and its ability to turn its financial performance around.
