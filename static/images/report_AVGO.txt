**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-09-10 | 0.88  | 15.95 B$      |
| 2025-06-11 | 1.05  | 15.00 B$      |
| 2025-03-12 | 1.17  | 14.92 B$      |

| 2025-09-10 | -0.4  | 13.07 B$      |

*   **Analysis:** There appears to be a duplicate entry of 2025-09-10 data, I will be discarding the second entry.
The recent trend shows increasing revenue and fluctuating EPS. While recent EPS is a little lower than the previous 2 quarters, it's important to review the reasons for the EPS decrease (which is not provided). The significant jump in revenue in the most recent quarter is a positive sign. The 2024-09-11 data showing negative EPS should be considered within the bigger picture.
