## Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Stock Analysis Report

**Executive Summary:** Broadcom Inc. is a leading designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.  This report analyzes AVGO's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering financial metrics, recent price movements, and technical indicators.  AVGO demonstrates significantly higher returns than the S&P 500, but also exhibits higher volatility.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** AVGO's cumulative return is 830.03%, significantly outperforming VOO's 104.98%. The difference is 725.0 percentage points, placing it at the 87.4th percentile of its historical range (max 835.0%, min -39.7%).

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high alpha values (0.0 to 1.1) across all periods, indicating consistent outperformance relative to the market benchmark. The beta values (0.1 to 1.0) suggest high market sensitivity, with increasing sensitivity in recent periods (2021-2025). The significant increase in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and market capitalization from 2015-2025 also signals strong growth.  High maximum drawdown (MDD) values, however, highlight significant risk associated with this superior performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $191.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $191.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $193.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $216.10

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term downward pressure.  The price is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more substantial recent decline.  The small positive change from the previous close ($0.59) suggests a minor upward correction.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.10 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.46 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.0 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 71.2% (significantly higher than the S&P 500's expected return)

The minor price increase from the previous close, while not a significant jump, is consistent with the positive PPO and mildly bullish RSI. The negative relative divergence change indicates a near-term bearish momentum that could reverse.  The high expected return supports the long-term investment thesis.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While some quarters show high EPS and revenue, others show significant drops.  Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying causes of this volatility.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Broadcom (AVGO) demonstrates strong historical performance significantly exceeding the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance comes with higher volatility, reflected in the high MDD values and fluctuating earnings.  While recent price action shows some short-term weakness, the long-term outlook, supported by high expected returns and generally positive technical indicators, remains favorable.  A deeper dive into the causes of earnings volatility and a more comprehensive risk assessment is recommended before making investment decisions.  The duplicate earnings data point requires clarification.
