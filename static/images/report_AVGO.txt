## Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Stock Performance Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), a leading designer, developer, and global supplier of a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, has demonstrated significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  However, recent price action suggests a potential slowdown, warranting further investigation.  The company shows strong growth potential but also exhibits high volatility.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AVGO's cumulative return (899.62%) drastically outperforms VOO's (122.48%) resulting in a substantial divergence (currently 777.1, representing the 87.9th percentile of historical divergence).  This superior performance is consistently reflected in the provided alpha and beta data.  High beta values (mostly above 90) indicate high sensitivity to market movements, while consistently positive alpha values suggest outperformance beyond market benchmarks.  The exceptionally high CAGR values, particularly in recent years (2021-2023 and 2022-2024), underscore AVGO's strong growth trajectory.  However, Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) also reflect significant risk associated with these high returns.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $228.53
* **Previous Close:** $233.04
* **Change:** -$4.51 (a -1.94% decrease)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $233.75
* **20-day Moving Average:** $227.56
* **60-day Moving Average:** $212.50

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bearish trend, but above both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.59 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a near-term pullback.)
* **PPO:** 0.08 (Slightly positive, indicating bullish momentum, but weak.)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.5% (Short-term bearish divergence.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 65.8% (Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is projected if investing over a longer period, although this projection should be taken with caution.)

The recent price drop (-1.94%) is notable but doesn't, in itself, signal a significant market event like a sharp crash or sudden surge.  The combination of technical indicators suggests a potentially short-term bearish correction within a longer-term bullish trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and requires clarification.  There are duplicated entries and discrepancies in the EPS figures.  A more reliable and complete dataset is needed for a thorough analysis.  Below is the table as provided.


| 날짜       | EPS      | 매출           |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 2024-09-11 | -0.4     | 13.07 B$        |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of crucial financial data like Total Revenue and Gross Profit significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This data is essential to assess profitability, growth trends, and overall financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AVGO exhibits a strong historical record of outperforming the S&P 500, supported by high CAGR and positive alpha values.  However, its high beta implies significant volatility, and recent price movements and some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction.  The inconsistent earnings data and lack of key financial information hinder a more robust assessment.  Further investigation into the earnings inconsistencies and acquiring complete financial statements is crucial before making any investment decisions.  While the long-term outlook appears positive based on past performance and projected returns, the significant volatility necessitates a careful risk management strategy.
