The significant drop in EPS and the volatility in equity and ROE raise concerns.  The high beta implies significant market sensitivity.  Further investigation into the recent earnings drop and the fluctuations in equity and ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions. The projected high long-term return should be considered with caution given the recent market performance and volatility in financial data.  Thorough due diligence and consideration of risk tolerance are paramount.
