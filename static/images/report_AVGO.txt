AVGO has shown exceptional long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and Q3 2024 earnings results indicate a potential short-term correction or a more significant issue affecting profitability.  While long-term prospects remain strong (supported by high expected return and consistent revenue growth), investors should carefully monitor the company's earnings reports and the reasons for the recent price decline and negative ROE before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the Q3 2024 EPS and ROE drop is crucial.  The significant negative price change in the last market data underscores the need for caution.
