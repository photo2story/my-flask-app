* **5-Day Moving Average:** $200.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $192.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $189.76

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support. The recent price drop of -1.97% is notable.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 0.41   | $2.26B        |
| 2024-11-21 | 1.07   | $2.14B        |
| 2024-05-21 | 0.86   | $1.98B        |
| 2024-02-21 | 5.47   | $1.98B        |
| 2025-02-14 | 2.73   | $1.98B        |

*Note: There's a discrepancy in the data; the February 14, 2025 entry appears twice with different EPS figures.  This needs clarification to properly analyze the earnings trend.*  Assuming the first 2025-02-14 entry is an error, the data shows fluctuation in EPS, possibly reflecting seasonal variations or one-time events. Revenue seems relatively stable.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $2.26B | 73.46% |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.14B | 74.09% |
| 2024-07-31 | $2.19B | 73.80% |
| 2024-04-30 | $1.98B | 74.12% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|

| 2024-07-31 | $5.17B | 6.92% |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.47B | 6.24% |
| 2024-01-31 | $4.36B | 40.09% |

Revenue is relatively stable and high, with consistently strong profit margins.  However, ROE shows significant fluctuation, requiring further investigation into the underlying causes.  The exceptionally high ROE in 2024-01-31 warrants further scrutiny.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PANW demonstrates a strong historical track record of outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with high CAGR and substantial alpha in several periods. Recent short-term price action suggests a potential correction, but the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by a high expected return, generally stable and strong revenue with high profit margins.  However, the inconsistent ROE and some unexplained earnings data points warrant further analysis and investigation before making any investment decisions.  The significant price drop needs further context and analysis to ascertain the underlying cause.  More detailed information on the earnings data and ROE fluctuations is needed for a comprehensive assessment.
