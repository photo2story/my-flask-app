**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to be completed.  The provided data does not contain this information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicating a potentially attractive investment.  The high and consistent profit margins and generally increasing equity demonstrate strong financial health.  However, the volatility in EPS and ROE warrants further investigation. Recent price movement is positive, although the technical indicators offer a mixed signal. The projected long-term outperformance is substantial, but depends on several factors that this report does not currently address.  The incomplete earnings data, the lack of recent news and analyst opinions, and the substantial volatility in certain financial metrics prevent a more conclusive assessment.  Further investigation is needed to incorporate missing data points to enable a complete and confident investment recommendation.

A thorough analysis requires the missing data points noted above. Once complete, the analysis should consider:

* **Industry Competition:** How does PANW compare to its competitors in the cybersecurity market?
* **Future Growth Prospects:** What are the company's plans for future growth and innovation?
* **Risk Assessment:** What are the major risks associated with investing in PANW?
