Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) is a cybersecurity company providing network security, cloud security, and endpoint security solutions.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and a relatively low beta (around 0.1), suggesting strong performance with relatively low correlation to the overall market.

The price is currently below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend, although it is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating some short-term support.  The recent price change (-$0.20) represents a minor daily decrease.
