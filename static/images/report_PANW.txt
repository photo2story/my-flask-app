**6. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the analysis reveals some inconsistencies in earnings and ROE data that require deeper investigation. The current price is slightly below its 20-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term correction.  While long-term prospects look promising given the expected return,  a thorough review of the erratic EPS and ROE data is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high profit margins and consistent revenue growth are positive signs. The inconsistent Alpha and Beta values suggest its performance isn't always consistent with overall market trends.  Further due diligence is recommended.
