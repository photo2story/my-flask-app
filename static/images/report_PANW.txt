* **Closing Price:** $389.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $398.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $393.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $370.00

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent price decline. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 50.93 - This suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, indicating a relatively neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.27 - A negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.8 - Suggests a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 222.5% - This represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.  The fact that the last price ($389.83) is relatively close to the 5-day moving average ($398.44)  does not strongly indicate either a rapid surge or a sharp drop, considering the slight recent downtrend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and relatively consistent revenue growth.  There's a significant spike in EPS in the quarter ending February 21, 2024 ($5.47), which is unusually high compared to other quarters.  Revenue growth shows a general upward trend, though not consistently accelerating. Further analysis of the EPS is needed, as the duplicated data point for November 21, 2024, needs clarification.  A thorough analysis needs the full context, such as analyst expectations, to determine if any of these results were beats or misses.

* **Revenue:** Revenue is relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating consistent performance.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are consistently high (above 73%), demonstrating strong profitability.
* **Equity & ROE (Return on Equity):** Equity shows growth except for a small dip in Q2 2024 and a significant drop in Q4 2023. ROE is highly variable, showing a massive spike in Q1 2024 which needs to be explored further for context.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, with high and relatively consistent profit margins.  The recent price action shows a slight downward trend, but indicators are not extremely bearish. The significant variation in EPS and ROE across quarters, especially the Q1 2024 outlier needs to be further examined to understand the underlying factors.  Long-term investment potential seems promising, given the historical performance and the projected high expected return, but requires further investigation into the recent earnings volatility and the lack of information provided on market sentiment and analyst opinions.  The complete picture would necessitate a more thorough examination of factors such as competitive landscape, technological advancements within the cybersecurity industry, and potential future growth prospects.  The provided data is incomplete and requires additional context for complete and reliable analysis.
