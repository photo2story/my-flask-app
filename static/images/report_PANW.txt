This results in a final divergence of 226.8%, placing it at the 73.6th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided min/max range.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and a high beta (higher volatility than the market), particularly in more recent years.  This suggests PANW's returns are largely driven by its own performance but are also subject to significant market fluctuations. The increasing CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Beta values over time highlight the growth and increased market sensitivity of the company. The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate periods of significant losses, a risk inherent in higher-growth, higher-beta stocks.

* **Closing Price:** $173.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $176.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $187.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $189.99

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 22.80 - This indicates the stock is oversold, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible.  However, it's crucial to consider this in conjunction with other indicators.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.97 - A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -4.6% - Short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 60.9% (over the long term, 2+ years, relative to the S&P 500). This is a substantial expected outperformance.  However, this is a forecast and not a guarantee.  The high expected return comes from the historical data, but past performance isn't indicative of future results.  A high beta also points to potentially wide swings in performance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, it's a high-beta stock, meaning it's subject to higher volatility.  The recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, although the oversold RSI suggests a possible bounce.  The earnings data requires clarification due to inconsistencies.  The high projected long-term return is promising, but investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with high-growth, high-beta stocks.  Further due diligence, including a review of the questionable earnings data, is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The significant increase in equity and ROE in Q1 2024 warrants further investigation.
