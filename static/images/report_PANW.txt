## Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) Stock Performance Review

**0. Overview:**

Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) is a leading cybersecurity company providing a broad range of security products and services.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PANW has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return of PANW is 378.87%, while VOO's is 117.28%.  This results in a current return difference of 261.6%, placing it at the 83.1st percentile of the historical range (max difference: 323.2%, min difference: -41.3%).

The provided CAGR data further emphasizes this outperformance.  While exhibiting higher volatility (MDD), PANW consistently demonstrates superior growth compared to the S&P 500, reflected in its high alpha values (particularly in recent years).  The beta values suggest a higher-than-average sensitivity to market movements, though this risk is clearly compensated by significantly higher returns.  Market capitalization has also increased substantially over the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $190.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $198.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $192.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $189.74

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent price change (-$0.335) indicates a slight downward movement,  not significant enough to be considered a sharp drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.77 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.136 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -5.4% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 49.3% (Significant outperformance compared to S&P 500 projected)

The combination of a slightly negative PPO, negative recent relative divergence, and price below moving averages paints a cautiously bearish short-term picture. However, the high expected return over the long term suggests a positive outlook for investors with a long-term horizon.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-02-14 | $0.41  | $2.26B      |
| 2024-11-21 | $1.07  | $2.14B      |
| 2024-05-21 | $0.86  | $1.98B      |
| 2024-02-21 | $5.47  | $1.98B      |
| 2025-02-14 | $2.73  | $1.98B      | *(Duplicate entry, potential data error)*


There appears to be an error in the data; the same date (2025-02-14) appears twice with different EPS figures.  Inconsistencies in EPS figures across quarters prevent reliable trend analysis without clarification.  Revenue shows slight growth, but EPS volatility is too high to draw conclusions.  Further investigation is needed to resolve the data discrepancies.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $2.26B   | 73.46%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.14B   | 74.09%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $2.19B   | 73.80%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $1.98B   | 74.12%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $1.98B   | 74.73%        |

Revenue shows modest growth. Profit margins remain consistently high, indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE      |
|------------|----------|----------|
| 2025-01-31 | $6.38B   | 4.19%    |
| 2024-10-31 | $5.91B   | 5.93%    |
| 2024-07-31 | $5.17B   | 6.92%    |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.47B   | 6.24%    |
| 2024-01-31 | $4.36B   | 40.09%   | *(Outlier, needs investigation)*

Equity shows a steady increase. ROE is generally strong, though the exceptionally high ROE in 2024-01-31 requires further examination to determine if it reflects a one-time event or underlying trend.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has historically shown strong performance exceeding the S&P 500, driven by high growth and consistent profitability. While short-term indicators suggest a slightly bearish trend, the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by high projected returns and consistently strong financial fundamentals (excluding some data inconsistencies requiring further investigation).  Investors with a long-term horizon may find PANW attractive, but a thorough review of the inconsistencies in the earnings and ROE data is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high beta suggests significant volatility should also be considered.
