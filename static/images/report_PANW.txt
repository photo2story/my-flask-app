**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-11-20 | 0.49 | 2.47 B$    |
| 2025-05-21 | 0.39 | 2.29 B$    |

| 2025-11-20 | 0.54 | 2.14 B$    |

**Analysis:** Revenue has generally been increasing over the past five quarters.  EPS has fluctuated. This implies that while PANW is growing its top line (revenue), profitability (as reflected in EPS) is more inconsistent. It is strange to see two entries for 2025-11-20 with different EPS and Revenue numbers. There might be data errors.

**Analysis:** Equity has been consistently increasing. ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated, but with a decreasing trend, implying that PANW's ability to generate profit from shareholders' equity has declined.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

PANW has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically.  Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, but analysts remain optimistic with a Buy consensus and high target prices. The company is operating in the growing cybersecurity space, especially related to AI, with a large potential Google Cloud deal.

However, the high Maximum Drawdown, the negative short-term divergence, and a slightly decreasing ROE trend should be considered. The mixed news sentiment suggests potential volatility.
