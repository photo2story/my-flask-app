*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current Divergence:** 31.6
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 40.2

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Table:**

The table presents a rolling 3-year view of PANW's performance relative to the market.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR fluctuates significantly, demonstrating periods of both strong growth (e.g., 87% in 2019-2021) and periods of contraction (e.g., -3% in 2016-2018).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently high, around 70-80%. This shows PANW is a volatile stock, prone to significant price declines from peak to trough within these periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis.  Positive Alpha indicates outperformance relative to its risk. PANW's Alpha varies, with some periods showing significant outperformance (e.g., 85% in 2021-2023) and others showing underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market (S&P 500). A Beta of 1 means the stock moves in line with the market.
    *   Betas close to 0 suggest PANW's movements were largely independent of the market in those periods.
    *   Higher Betas (0.6) in recent periods indicate a stronger correlation with the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** PANW's market cap has generally increased over time, reflecting its growth as a company.

**Summary of Alpha/Beta:**  Historically, PANW has shown periods of strong independent performance (high Alpha, low Beta). More recently, it has become more correlated with the overall market (higher Beta), but still demonstrates the potential for outperformance. The high MDD highlights the risk associated with this stock.
