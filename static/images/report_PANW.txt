### 2. Recent Price Action

**Key Data:**

*   **Current Price:** $172.88

*   **5-Day Moving Average:** $185.57
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $194.37
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $194.76

**Analysis:**

The current price shows a slight decrease from the previous close.  The price is trading below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The fact that the 5-day moving average is the lowest of the three reinforces this bearish signal.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3358 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 33.07
*   **PPO:** -1.47
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -15.0 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_65%_Sell 8.9% of holdings (55 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)
*   **Expected Return:** 161.5% (Over 2 years, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI indicates low market risk, which is a positive sign for the overall market environment.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 33.07 suggests that PANW is nearing oversold conditions, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, reinforcing the short-term downtrend seen in the price action analysis.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** A negative value confirms the recent short-term decline.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal recommends a cautious approach, advising to sell a small portion of holdings and increase cash reserves. This is likely due to the recent price decline and potential uncertainty.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return of 161.5% over two years suggests that analysts are optimistic about PANW's long-term growth potential compared to the S&P 500.

The slight price decrease from the previous close (change of -0.41%) is not a significant "변동 이슈" in itself, but it contributes to the overall picture of short-term weakness. If the change had been significantly larger (e.g., -5% or more), it would warrant a stronger emphasis on volatility.
