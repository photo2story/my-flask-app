*   **Analysis of Alpha/Beta:**
    *   **CAGR:** Strong growth in recent years, reflecting market demand for cybersecurity solutions.
    *   **MDD:** High maximum drawdown figures consistently above 70% indicate significant volatility.
    *   **Alpha:** Consistently positive Alpha values in the most recent periods (2018-2025) indicate PANW is generating returns above what would be expected based on market movements alone, meaning it is outperforming its benchmark. Notably, the Alpha in 2021-2023 stands out, suggesting substantial outperformance during that period.  The 2023-2025 Alpha is lower, indicating potentially reduced outperformance, but is still positive.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values are relatively low (generally below 0.6), suggesting PANW is less sensitive to overall market movements than the S&P 500. A negative Beta for 2020-2022 means that PANW moved in the opposite direction of the market during that period, which can be a positive characteristic during market downturns.
    *   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization shows a robust growth trajectory, reflecting investor confidence and the company's expanding presence.

*   20-day SMA: 190.47
*   60-day SMA: 202.39
*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which could be interpreted as a short-term bearish signal. The close price is slightly above the 5-day SMA, suggesting a possible stabilization or slight upward trend in the very near term.

*   Expected Return (%): 104.3 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A high MRI score indicates a favorable market environment for investment in this stock.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI is below 40, suggesting the stock may be oversold and could potentially rebound.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO value suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating a potential uptrend (although the value is quite low).
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying with a high allocation, reinforcing the MRI's positive outlook.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change (-3.0) indicates a short-term decline in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return (104.3%) suggests significant potential upside if held long-term, but also might be optimistic.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   **Positive:** Articles highlight the company's strong financials and potential buying opportunities after a dip.
    *   **Negative:** One article points to a "costly deal," which may raise concerns about the company's capital allocation strategy.
    *   **Neutral:** Other articles focus on market performance and comparisons with peers.
*   **Analysis:** Investors should carefully evaluate the details of the "costly deal" mentioned in the Seeking Alpha article to understand its potential impact on the company's financials and future growth prospects. The other news items suggest a generally positive outlook, with some potential for short-term price volatility.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.80)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 225.42, High: 255.00, Low: 131.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent changes listed.
*   **Analysis:** The strong buy consensus and the average target price significantly above the current price suggest that analysts are optimistic about PANW's future performance. The wide range between the high and low target prices indicates some uncertainty in the outlook. The lack of recent rating changes could mean that analysts' views are relatively stable.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-11-20 | 0.49 | 2.47 B$    |
| 2025-05-21 | 0.39 | 2.29 B$    |

| 2025-11-20 | 0.54 | 2.14 B$    |

*   **Analysis:** The table shows a trend of increasing revenue over the past few quarters. EPS has fluctuated, but generally is positive, demonstrating profitability. The jump in EPS for 2024-11-21 is an outlier and should be investigated to determine what caused this significant increase. Duplicated data (2025-11-20) requires clarification.
