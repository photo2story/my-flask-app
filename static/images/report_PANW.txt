## Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) Investment Review

This report analyzes Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW), a cybersecurity company providing cloud-based security services, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PANW's cumulative return (344.28%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (37.39%).  The difference is 306.9%, placing it at the 73.3rd percentile of its historical range (max: 390.5%, min: 77.9%).  This indicates strong historical outperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data further supports this, consistently showing significantly higher growth rates than implied by the S&P 500's performance.  However, the high beta (95-117) suggests substantial market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $175.51
* **Last Market Price:** $171.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $180.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $189.57
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $190.45

The stock is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The Last Market Price of $171.90 is significantly below the moving averages, indicating a potential recent decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (15.10):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.90):**  Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-7.8%):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.

The combination of a low RSI and negative PPO suggests bearish momentum, although the oversold RSI hints at a potential rebound.  The negative divergence strengthens this bearish sentiment. The expected return of 89.9% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is significant, implying considerable outperformance potential. However, the recent price drop needs to be considered. A large jump from $171.90 (Last Market) would indicate a significant and potentially short-lived rebound.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-11-21).  Assuming the duplicate is an error, and focusing on unique entries only:

* **Revenue:** Shows a generally upward trend, although growth has slowed slightly in the most recent quarter.
* **EPS:**  Significant variability in EPS exists across quarters.  The Q2 2024 EPS ($5.47) is significantly higher than other reported quarters. This should be examined further for possible accounting or reporting explanations.  Generally, EPS has been erratic.

Without further context or clarity about the EPS fluctuations, a definitive analysis on beats or misses against expectations is impossible.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue has been relatively stable with slight fluctuations around $2 billion in recent quarters.
* **Profit Margin:**  Maintains consistently high profit margins around 74%, indicating strong profitability.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity displays fluctuating growth, and ROE shows extreme variability, reaching an unusually high 40.09% in Q1 2024 followed by a significant drop. This necessitates further investigation into the underlying causes of this volatility.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news (within the last 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to provide a complete analysis.  This data was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PANW exhibits a history of strong outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a bearish trend, indicated by the stock trading below its moving averages and negative technical indicators (PPO, divergence). While the oversold RSI might suggest a short-term bounce, the high beta implies considerable market sensitivity.  The significant variations in EPS and ROE require further investigation.  Long-term prospects look promising based on the high expected return, but the current market context and price action should be carefully considered.  Adding context from news, analyst opinions and additional financial information would improve the accuracy and reliability of this analysis.
