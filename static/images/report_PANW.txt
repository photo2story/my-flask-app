## Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) is a cybersecurity company providing network security and cloud security solutions.

The cumulative return of PANW is 427.46%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 130.06%.  The difference is 297.4 percentage points.  This places PANW at the 87.6th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500, based on a historical range of -40% to 345%.  While this indicates strong relative performance, it's crucial to remember this is a relative measure against the S&P 500 and does not guarantee future outperformance.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows consistently high returns (CAGR) over the years, alongside increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)).  The beta is consistently above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Close:** $387.82
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $387.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $386.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $363.88

The stock price is slightly above its short-term moving averages, suggesting recent stability or minor upward momentum.  The difference between the last close ($387.82) and the last market price ($390.85) suggests a minor dip since the last market close.  This is not a significant price change.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.77 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.41 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):**  NaN (-) (Indicates recent downward trend in relative performance)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 233.2% (This is a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this is a projection and not a guarantee.  High expected returns usually come with higher risk.)

The combination of a negative PPO and a slightly below-neutral RSI suggests potential downward pressure. However, the long-term expected return remains significant, highlighting the potential for continued growth, but also the inherent risks. The lack of data for the relative strength change makes interpreting the short-term trend more challenging. The provided Last Market price ($390.85) being higher than the Last Close ($387.82) indicates a slight dip; not considered a significant 'rapid' change either up or down.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS, but generally increasing revenue. There is no information about expected values for comparison against actuals, so "beats" or "misses" cannot be determined.

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue generally shows an upward trend, though there is some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.
* **EPS Trends:**  EPS has shown variability.  The Q2 2024 EPS ($5.47) is significantly higher than other quarters, but without additional context (e.g., one-time events, accounting changes), itâ€™s difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the trend.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable with minor fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high, ranging from 73.8% to 74.83%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows growth, though ROE is highly volatile.  The exceptionally high ROE in Q1 2024 (40.09%) warrants further investigation to understand the underlying drivers.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or analyst opinions within the last two days were provided.  Information on recent market outlook and analyst opinions is missing.  Therefore, no analysis can be made here.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has demonstrated exceptionally strong performance relative to the S&P 500 over the provided period. The high CAGR and increasing market cap reinforce this. However, recent technical indicators suggest some short-term bearish pressure.  The high volatility (indicated by the beta and the significant swing in EPS and ROE) presents risk.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive assessment of current market sentiment.  A deeper dive into the unusually high Q2 2024 EPS and the exceptionally high ROE in Q1 2024 is crucial for a more informed assessment.  The projected long-term return is substantial but should be considered within the context of its inherent risks.
