**6. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has demonstrated strong long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests a minor pullback, the underlying fundamentals – strong revenue growth, high profit margins, and a high projected return – remain positive.  However, the volatility in EPS and ROE necessitates further investigation into potential accounting adjustments or one-time events.  The current valuation, relative to historical performance and projected returns, warrants consideration.  Long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance could find PANW an attractive opportunity,  but short-term investors should be cautious of the potential for near-term volatility.  Careful scrutiny of the unusual EPS and ROE figures is crucial before making any investment decisions.
