*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 57.77 (Neutral - not overbought or oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.21 (Slightly below zero, indicates a potential weakening of the short-term trend relative to the long-term trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell 79.9% of holdings (Risky - MRI:0.50) - A hybrid signal suggests selling a significant portion of holdings and increasing the cash position due to perceived risk.

**Analysis:**

The MRI suggests high investment is recommended, but the hybrid signal indicates caution, suggesting some risk. A negative change in the relative spread indicates a short-term decline in outperformance. However, the RSI is neutral, and the long-term expected return is quite high. The 'price': 215.02, 'previousClose': 212.42, 'change': 1.22 indicates the price slightly increased, which should be carefully reviewed whether it reverses the short-term decline.
