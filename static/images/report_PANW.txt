The inconsistencies in the earnings data and the substantial fluctuation in ROE require further investigation.  A comprehensive analysis should include a deeper dive into these inconsistencies, as well as a more thorough examination of the company's competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and overall risk profile before making any investment decisions.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bearish trend.
