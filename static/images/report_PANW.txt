**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) is a cybersecurity company providing network security, cloud security, and endpoint security products and services.

The cumulative return of PANW is 426.11%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 124.78%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 301.33%, placing it in the 88.65th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates strong outperformance historically.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows PANW consistently exhibiting a beta greater than 1 (except for a few periods) indicating higher volatility than the market. However, the alpha is mostly positive, suggesting that it has generated excess returns compared to the market benchmark.  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the years reflects the company's growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $386.83 (Last Market: $386.74)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $393.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $376.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $358.82

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downtrend, but above its 20 and 60-day moving averages indicating a longer-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (65.89):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.16):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):**  1.93 (+), showing short-term upward price movement.

Given the current price ($386.74), the indicators suggest a slightly overbought market but still positive momentum. No significant rapid price changes (sharp increases or decreases) are indicated based solely on these numbers. The expected return of 24.04% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is significant.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some volatility.  While revenue has generally increased, EPS shows fluctuations.  To properly analyze, the figures need to be compared to analyst expectations and prior periods. More context, such as the company's guidance, is needed for a more thorough assessment. Missing data points and the repetition of a data point (2024-05-21) make a complete assessment impossible.

**5. Financial Information (Revenue and Profitability):**

The quarterly data shows consistent revenue growth and high profit margins. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile, with a very high value in Q1 2024 (40.09%) that may warrant further investigation. This requires further investigation to determine the factors driving this volatility and its long term implications.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

PANW has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly. The company shows consistent revenue growth and high profit margins. While recent price action suggests a minor short-term correction, the long-term outlook seems positive, supported by the high expected return. However, the volatile EPS and ROE figures, along with an RSI approaching overbought levels, warrant careful monitoring.  Recent news, analyst opinions, and a comparison of actual earnings to analyst expectations are crucial for a complete picture.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Based on the available data, PANW appears to be a strong performer with significant long-term growth potential.  However,  the current RSI suggests potential near-term price correction.  Thorough due diligence, including analysis of recent news and financial filings, is necessary before making any investment decision. A long-term investment strategy, considering the volatility inherent in the stock, might be suitable.
