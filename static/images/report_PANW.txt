**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a complete financial analysis.  This information is crucial for assessing the company's profitability and financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. While recent price action shows a slight downward trend, positive momentum indicators suggest potential for future growth.  However, the high beta indicates higher volatility.  The lack of comprehensive financial data limits a thorough assessment of the company's financial health.  Further investigation into the earnings data inconsistencies and acquiring complete financial statements are crucial for a more comprehensive and confident investment decision.  The high expected return, coupled with medium risk, makes PANW a potentially attractive investment for long-term investors with a moderate risk tolerance, but a thorough due diligence is essential before making any investment decisions.
