Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a cybersecurity company providing cloud-based security services.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), PANW shows significantly higher cumulative returns but also exhibits higher volatility.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance over the years. While Beta is consistently high, indicating high volatility compared to the market, Alpha (the excess return compared to the market) fluctuates, showing periods of significant outperformance (e.g., 2017-2019, 2021-2023) and underperformance.
