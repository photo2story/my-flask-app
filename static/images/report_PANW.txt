**2. Recent Price Movements:**

PANW's price is currently above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  This is supported by the positive 20-day relative divergence.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (66.98):**  Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, implying a potential pullback might be imminent. However, given the strong overall trend, this might not be a significant concern in the long term.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+7.5):** This indicates a recent increase in the relative strength of PANW compared to the benchmark.  The positive value confirms the short-term upward trend.

* **Expected Return (36.8%):**  This suggests a substantial long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 if the current trajectory continues.  This is a high estimate, and future performance is not guaranteed.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 0.41  | $2.26 B       |

The EPS figures show significant volatility, and there is a need to further investigate the apparent data inconsistency concerning the Feb 2025 entry and revenue.  More data is needed for a comprehensive analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a complete financial assessment. This is a significant limitation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has demonstrated exceptional performance compared to the S&P 500, showing high growth and consistently positive alpha.  However, the RSI suggests potential short-term overbought conditions. The significant volatility in EPS and the lack of complete financial data necessitate further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions.  The high projected long-term return should be viewed cautiously, as past performance is not indicative of future results.  More comprehensive financial data is crucial for a robust and reliable analysis.
