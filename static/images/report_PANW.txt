**Analysis:**

*   **Outperformance:** PANW has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, as demonstrated by the positive absolute divergence. The relative divergence suggests this outperformance is positioned in the upper range of its historical trend.
*   **Alpha:** The alpha values fluctuate, with periods of negative alpha early on, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark. However, more recent periods show strong positive alpha, suggesting PANW's returns are increasingly independent of the market.
*   **Beta:** The beta values are generally close to zero, and sometimes negative, indicating PANW's returns have a very low correlation with the market. This suggests that PANW is not particularly sensitive to broad market movements.
*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) demonstrates strong growth over various periods, highlighting PANW's growth potential.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant potential downside risk, with drawdowns consistently above 50%. This highlights the stock's volatility and potential for substantial losses during market downturns.
*   **Cap:** The market capitalization has significantly increased over the years, reflecting PANW's growth and increasing market value.

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $199.68
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $188.30

**Analysis:**

*   The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a short-term minor pullback, but the overall trend may still be upward. The last market data showing a small decrease (-$0.87) is a minor fluctuation and does not necessarily indicate a significant trend reversal.

*   **Expected Return:** 62.5% (Over a 2+ year investment horizon compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

| 2025-02-14 | 0.41 | 2.26 B$   |

*   **EPS Trend:** EPS (Earnings Per Share) shows variability. There was a significant increase from 2024-05-21 (0.86) to 2024-11-21 (1.07), followed by a decrease in subsequent periods.
*   **Recent Dip:** There is a drop in EPS in the most recent period (2025-05-21), which is worth noting. This may be a point of concern, especially if the revenue growth does not fully compensate for the EPS decline.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-04-30   | $2.29B  | 72.94%        |
| 2025-01-31   | $2.26B  | 73.46%        |
| 2024-10-31   | $2.14B  | 74.09%        |
| 2024-07-31   | $2.19B  | 73.80%        |
| 2024-04-30   | $1.98B  | 74.12%        |

**Capital and Profitability**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE     |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| 2025-04-30   | $7.23B  | 3.62%   |
| 2025-01-31   | $6.38B  | 4.19%   |
| 2024-10-31   | $5.91B  | 5.93%   |
| 2024-07-31   | $5.17B  | 6.92%   |
| 2024-04-30   | $4.47B  | 6.24%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is increasing, showing positive growth over the last five quarters. Profit margins remain high, consistently above 72%, which indicates that the company is effective at controlling costs and maintaining profitability despite revenue fluctuations.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is increasing over the last five quarters, indicating a strengthening financial position. However, ROE (Return on Equity) has been decreasing over the same period. This suggests that while the company's equity base is growing, it is not generating as much profit from each dollar of equity as it did in the past.

**7. Overall Summary & Conclusion**

Palo Alto Networks (PANW) demonstrates strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, along with a significant growth rate and increasing revenue.  The high, though volatile, profit margins, and growing equity base present a positive picture of financial health.  The low MRI suggests a favorable market environment.

However, several points warrant consideration:

*   **Volatility:** The high MDD indicates substantial downside risk.
*   **Recent EPS Dip:** The recent decline in EPS needs to be investigated further to determine if it's a temporary issue or a sign of a developing trend.
*   **Decreasing ROE:** The declining ROE, despite increasing equity, could indicate that the company's ability to generate profit from equity is diminishing.
*   **Short-term Performance:** The recent negative change in relative divergence and price action suggests a minor pullback in performance, but it might be temporary.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, PANW may still be a good investment opportunity with potential for long-term outperformance. However, investors should closely monitor the EPS trend, ROE, and news related to market events to make informed decisions. The expected 62.5% return is attractive, but the risks, particularly the stock's volatility, should be carefully considered. A cautious approach, possibly involving a smaller initial investment and monitoring performance, is advisable.
