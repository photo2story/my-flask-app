Okay, let's break down the provided information on Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW).

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Palo Alto Networks Inc. is a global cybersecurity leader.
*   **PANW Cumulative Return:** 132.50%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current Divergence: 33.0 (PANW is outperforming VOO by this much in cumulative return)
    *   Relative Divergence: 40.9 (PANW's current outperformance relative to VOO is in the bottom half of its historical range compared to VOO).

*   **Analysis:** PANW has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the tracked period. However, the relative divergence suggests that its current outperformance isn't at its peak compared to its historical performance relative to VOO.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

*   **Table Summary:**
    *   **CAGR:** Varies significantly from negative to positive, showing volatility.
    *   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdowns across all periods suggest high risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Generally positive after 2018-2020, indicating outperformance relative to its benchmark (risk-adjusted). A dramatic jump in the 2021-2023 period.
    *   **Beta:** Generally low (close to 0), suggesting low market sensitivity. However, there is a slight increase recently to 0.6.
    *   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has increased.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The high MDD figures indicate that PANW is a volatile stock.
    *   The positive Alpha values (especially in recent periods) are promising, indicating that the company's stock performance has exceeded what would be expected based on its market risk (Beta). A possible reason is the increased demand for cybersecurity solutions.
    *   A consistently low Beta suggests that PANW's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market.
