**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to complete the analysis.  This data was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PANW exhibits strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 historically.  However, recent short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend. The highly volatile EPS and ROE figures, require additional information to understand these figures. The high expected return of 56.1% suggests attractive long-term investment potential, particularly for investors with a long-term horizon of two years or more.  The oversold RSI suggests a potential bounce. However, the negative PPO and recent price action below moving averages indicate a cautious outlook in the short term. A deeper dive into the reasons for the volatile EPS and ROE figures, coupled with current market sentiment and analyst opinions, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Additional information, particularly regarding recent news and earnings expectations, would significantly enhance the robustness of this analysis.
