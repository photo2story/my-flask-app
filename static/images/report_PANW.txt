PANW has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn, the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by high profit margins and strong expected returns.  However, volatility in EPS and ROE warrants careful monitoring.  Further analysis of the earnings data and the exceptionally high ROE in Q1 2024 is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The significant variation in some key financial metrics necessitates a deeper dive into the company's financial reports and news to understand the underlying causes.  A long-term investment approach, given the long-term expected return, appears reasonable, but close monitoring is advised due to the observed volatility.
