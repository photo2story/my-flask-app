PANW has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a significant cumulative return difference.

However, the inconsistent EPS figures and the outlier ROE require further investigation to assess the risk-reward profile comprehensively.  The high beta indicates higher volatility than the overall market. A thorough review of the causes of the EPS and ROE fluctuations is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high profit margins and consistent revenue suggest a robust business model.
