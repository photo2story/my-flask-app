    *   20-day MA: 199.81
    *   60-day MA: 190.86

**Analysis:** The stock price is trading above all three moving averages, which is generally considered a bullish signal. The 5-day MA is above the 20-day MA, and the 20-day MA is above the 60-day MA, reinforcing this bullish trend.  The slight positive change in the last market data suggests continued upward momentum.

**3) Technical Indicators and Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 63.19 (Approaching overbought territory but not yet there)
*   **PPO:** -0.14 (Slightly below zero, indicating short-term weakness but not significantly so)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe - MRI:0.90).  Recommends a small monthly investment.

*   **Expected Return:** 34.3% (Long-term expected outperformance vs. S&P 500).

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates a high level of investment suitability. While the RSI is elevated, the PPO suggests a potential short-term pullback. The negative change in relative divergence reinforces this possibility. However, the hybrid signal and high expected return suggest a positive long-term outlook. The slight positive change ($0.18) from the previous close is not significant enough to suggest any major immediate volatility.
