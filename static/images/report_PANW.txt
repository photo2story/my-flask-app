* **Closing Price:** $184.20

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $194.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $190.16

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (37.19):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (-0.85):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** A -1.6% change suggests recent downward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 49.2% outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This is a significant potential return, though subject to market fluctuations and inherent risks.  The current price of $184.20 near the oversold region of RSI might indicate a bounce back, but this should be assessed considering the negative PPO.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-11-21).  Focusing solely on the unique entries:

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue generally shows growth, albeit not consistently substantial from quarter-to-quarter. A slight dip is seen between Q1 and Q2 of 2024 before a rebound.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS fluctuates significantly across quarters.  A considerable spike in EPS occurred in the quarter ending 2024-02-21 (5.47). Without further context, it's challenging to definitively identify reasons behind these fluctuations.  One must be careful in drawing conclusions from such volatility.

**Note:**  Without access to expected earnings,  we can't comment on whether these results "beat" or "missed" expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue remained relatively stable around the $2B mark in the last two quarters, demonstrating consistent performance despite fluctuations.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are consistently high (above 73%), showcasing a healthy and profitable business model.  The slight downward trend warrants further investigation to identify potential reasons.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity has increased significantly from 2023 to 2024.  The ROE, however, shows volatility, with a particularly high value in Q1 2024 (40.09%) that requires further context for proper interpretation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PANW demonstrates strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests short-term bearishness (below moving averages, negative PPO), the oversold RSI and the substantial projected long-term outperformance present a potentially attractive investment opportunity. However, several aspects require further clarification:  the volatile EPS numbers, the reason for the Q1 2024 ROE spike, and the missing news and analyst information.  Thorough due diligence including analyzing the complete earnings reports, investor presentations, and financial filings is crucial before making any investment decisions.
