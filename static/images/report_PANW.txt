## Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) is a cybersecurity company providing cloud-based security services and network security products.

The cumulative return of PANW is 348.33%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference is 230.0%, placing it at the 74.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided maximum and minimum divergence values.  This indicates a strong outperformance historically, but not necessarily a guarantee of future performance.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data further supports this superior performance, consistently exceeding the implied growth of the S&P 500 over the analyzed periods.  The high beta (116.0) suggests significantly higher volatility than the market.  However, the consistently positive alpha (0.1) demonstrates that PANW has generated returns above what would be expected given its beta and the market's performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $177.11
* **5-day Moving Average:** $173.37
* **20-day Moving Average:** $180.78
* **60-day Moving Average:** $188.80

The price is currently below both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  The recent price change of -$0.03 indicates a slight decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 34.31 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.17 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +0.8 – This indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

The slight price decrease (-$0.03) is not significant enough to qualify as a rapid drop.  The expected return of 60.1% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant upside potential but should be considered with caution, as high expected returns generally come with high risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies and potential errors (e.g., duplicate entries for 2024-11-21). A proper analysis requires cleaned and consistent data.  However, a general trend shows fluctuations in EPS and relatively stable revenue in the billions.  A more in-depth analysis is needed with corrected data to identify growth patterns and trends.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable within a $1.9B - $2.19B range, with consistently high profit margins exceeding 73%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity and ROE show fluctuations but remain generally positive. The significant spike in ROE (40.09%) in Q1 2024 requires further investigation to understand the underlying factors.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However,  recent price action shows a short-term bearish trend, despite some technical indicators suggesting potential for a bounce. High long-term expected returns are presented but should be interpreted with caution due to the inherent risks involved with such predictions and the stock's high volatility.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in earnings data and the ROE spike is needed before drawing definitive conclusions.  The high beta value implies significant risk relative to the market.  Investors should carefully consider this risk-reward profile before investing.
