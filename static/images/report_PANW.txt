PANW has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, exhibiting high growth potential, as evidenced by the cumulative return and high expected return.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction.  While the company shows strong profitability and increasing equity, inconsistencies in EPS and the exceptionally high ROE in Q1 2024 require further analysis.  The high long-term expected return coupled with the current price drop below its moving averages present a nuanced situation;  further investigation into the drivers behind the recent price decline and the outlier EPS figure is crucial for informed investment decisions.  A deeper dive into the company's financials, news, and industry trends is needed to fully assess the current risk-reward profile.
