| 2025-02-14 | 0.41  | $2.26 B     |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows steady growth, with Profit Margins consistently high (73-75%).  Equity has grown steadily. ROE shows fluctuations, with a significant outlier in Q1 2024 (40.09%), likely related to the unusual EPS reported earlier.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PANW has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, the recent price drop and bearish technical indicators (RSI, PPO, MRI) suggest caution. The significant EPS volatility and the outlier in Q1 2024 require further investigation to understand the underlying drivers.  While the long-term outlook (2+ years) remains positive based on the projected outperformance, a more conservative approach might be warranted in the short term given the current market conditions and the need for clarification on some data points (duplicate earnings date and exceptionally high Q2 2024 EPS).  A deeper dive into the factors behind the recent price drop and the volatile earnings data is crucial before making any investment decisions.
