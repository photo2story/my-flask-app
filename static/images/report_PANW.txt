## Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) is a leading cybersecurity company providing network security, cloud security, and endpoint security solutions.  The analysis below examines PANW's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key financial indicators, and earnings data to assess its current market position and future prospects.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palo Alto Networks (PANW) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  PANW's cumulative return is 126.48%, while VOO's is 65.78%. This represents a difference of 60.7 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, is at the 55.5th percentile (meaning it's outperformed the S&P 500 by a greater margin than 55.5% of historical periods), indicating consistent above-average performance but also suggesting that it's not at its absolute historical peak of outperformance.  Further analysis is needed to determine whether this is sustainable.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows substantial growth over various periods, ranging from 1% to 118%.  The Alpha values suggest periods of both outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the market (Beta reflects the stock's volatility relative to the market, which is quite high).  Note that high Beta values (like 16 or 20) indicate high volatility, magnifying both gains and losses.  Capitalization (Cap(B)) has steadily increased, reflecting the company's growth.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 1.0% | 57.8% | -28.0% | 0.1 | 16.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 12.0% | 65.9% | -6.0% | -0.1 | 20.8 |
| 2017-2019  | 28.0% | 65.9% | -2.0% | 0.5 | 25.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 68.0% | 65.9% | 43.0% | 0.1 | 39.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 118.0% | 60.4% | 63.0% | 0.1 | 61.4 |
| 2020-2022  | 23.0% | 70.5% | 17.0% | -0.1 | 46.2 |
| 2021-2023  | 109.0% | 70.5% | 92.0% | 0.7 | 97.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 33.0% | 71.6% | 17.0% | 0.7 | 120.5 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $168.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $159.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $174.57
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $183.35

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price change of -$2.75 (-1.58%) indicates a small but noticeable decrease.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.70 (Approaching oversold territory; below 30 would be considered oversold.)
* **PPO:** -0.4595 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (Short-term upward trend, but this is contradicted by the moving averages.)
* **Expected Return:** 48.2% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500.  This high expected return needs justification and more detailed analysis of the assumptions.  Given the negative price movement, the high expected return is unexpected unless it reflects extreme confidence in a rebound.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in EPS, with a particularly high EPS of $5.47 in Q2 2024 and a much lower $0.41 in Q1 2025. Revenue has shown relatively stable growth, although it's worth noting that the provided EPS data is seemingly inconsistent and needs further verification for accuracy before it can be reliably analyzed.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 0.41 | 2.26 B$    |
| 2024-11-21 | 1.07 | 2.14 B$    |
| 2024-05-21 | 0.86 | 1.98 B$    |
| 2024-02-21 | 5.47 | 1.98 B$    |
| 2025-02-14 | 2.73 | 1.98 B$    |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, hovering around $2B. Profit margins are consistently high (above 73%), indicating strong profitability. Equity has shown growth, but ROE (Return on Equity) is volatile, exhibiting a strikingly high value of 40.09% in Q1 2024 before dropping significantly in subsequent quarters. This requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31   | $2.26B  | 73.46%        |
| 2024-10-31   | $2.14B  | 74.09%        |
| 2024-07-31   | $2.19B  | 73.80%        |
| 2024-04-30   | $1.98B  | 74.12%        |
| 2024-01-31   | $1.98B  | 74.73%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE   |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| 2025-01-31   | $6.38B  | 4.19% |
| 2024-10-31   | $5.91B  | 5.93% |
| 2024-07-31   | $5.17B  | 6.92% |
| 2024-04-30   | $4.47B  | 6.24% |
| 2024-01-31   | $4.36B  | 40.09% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

PANW has historically shown strong performance compared to the S&P 500, but recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn. While long-term prospects appear positive based on the high expected return and generally healthy profit margins, several factors warrant closer scrutiny:

* **Earnings Volatility:** The significant fluctuation in EPS requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  Inconsistency in the provided EPS data needs clarification.
* **ROE Volatility:** The extreme jump in ROE in Q1 2024 and subsequent drop necessitates careful examination of the financial statements to determine whether this is a genuine reflection of company performance or an accounting anomaly.
* **High Beta:**  The high beta values indicate significant volatility, making PANW a riskier investment.

Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to conduct more in-depth research, including reviewing financial statements, analyzing future growth prospects, and considering macroeconomic factors that might impact the cybersecurity industry.  The seemingly conflicting signals from the moving averages, the RSI, and the expected return, combined with the inconsistencies and volatility in the provided financial data, suggest a need for more comprehensive analysis before making any investment decisions.
