Specific comparison to expectations is not possible without additional data.  The significant jump in EPS from $0.86 to $5.47 between May 2024 and February 2024 requires further investigation to understand the underlying factors.  The duplicate data point for November 2024 needs clarification.

* **Profit Margin:** Remains consistently high throughout the observed period, indicating strong profitability.
* **Equity:** Equity increased from October 2023 to October 2024. This implies positive company growth.
