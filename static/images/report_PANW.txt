Okay, here's an analysis of Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) based on the data provided, structured for clarity and actionable insights:

**Executive Summary**

Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a global cybersecurity leader, offering a comprehensive platform for network, cloud, and endpoint security. PANW has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but recent technical indicators suggest caution. Strong revenue growth and positive analyst sentiment are tempered by overbought conditions and potential near-term volatility. A long-term, buy-and-hold strategy may be warranted, but with careful monitoring of short-term market signals.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**
