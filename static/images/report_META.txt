The current closing price is $586.0.  The price is slightly up from the previous close ($586.5 vs $586.0).  The stock is trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (40.58):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (-0.08):** Shows a bearish signal, indicating downward momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (-3.4):** Confirms recent short-term downward pressure.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 indicates a medium-risk level.
* **Expected Return (1.5%):**  The expected return is modest. The long-term (2+ years) projected excess return over the S&P 500 is 1.5%, suggesting a potential for outperformance but not a guaranteed high return.  This estimate should be viewed cautiously, as it does not account for unforeseen market shifts.  The small price change in the 'Last-Market' data does not suggest a significant recent surge or decline.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated significantly stronger performance than the S&P 500, with a high cumulative return. While recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, the strong earnings growth, high profit margins, and improving financial health suggest a positive long-term outlook.  The RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, and the relatively low expected return, while positive, should be considered in context with the medium-risk assessment.  Investors should carefully consider the historical volatility of META’s performance relative to the market before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence is recommended before investing.  The provided data points to strong fundamentals, but the market is inherently unpredictable.
