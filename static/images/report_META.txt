## Meta Platforms Inc (META) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on connecting people through its family of apps and services, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

Meta's cumulative return (184.50%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (89.44%). The difference is 95.1%, placing it at the 84.6th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating Alpha and Beta values over the years.  While Alpha is generally positive, indicating outperformance, Beta varies, suggesting sensitivity to market movements changes over time.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods, alongside significant maximum drawdowns (MDD) highlight the volatility inherent in Meta's stock. Notably, the market capitalization (Cap) steadily increases over the years.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 586.0
* **Last Market Price:** 585.88
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 590.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 603.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 644.49

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The small negative change (-0.02) from the previous close does not indicate a significant immediate shift.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.58 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.0764 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.4% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 1.5% (Long-term expected outperformance over S&P 500)


The combination of a relatively low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests bearish short-term momentum. However, the positive expected return indicates potential for long-term growth.  The slight price drop is not dramatic enough to warrant labeling as a "sharp drop".

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent growth in both EPS and revenue.  However, there's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-31.  Assuming the second entry is incorrect, we observe a clear upward trend.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Meta demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While short-term indicators suggest bearish momentum, the robust financial performance and positive long-term expected return suggest that a long-term investment strategy could be beneficial.  However, the historical volatility and significant drawdowns highlight the risk associated with this stock.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is recommended.
