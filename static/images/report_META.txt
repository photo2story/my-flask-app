* **Closing Price:** $504.73
* **Previous Close:** $531.62
* **Change:** -$5.06 (-0.95%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $556.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $589.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $640.64

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend. The recent drop of -$5.06 shows a significant short-term decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 25.85 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -1.15 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -7.1% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -11.2% (This suggests underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term at the current price.)

The combination of overbought RSI and negative PPO with a recent price drop suggests a potentially bearish outlook in the short term, although the RSI being in oversold territory implies a potential for a short-term bounce. The negative expected return emphasizes the risk associated with current valuations.  The large negative change in the price reflects a substantial drop.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  While the fundamentals (revenue, profitability, and equity) appear strong, the current valuation seems to be factoring in some negative sentiment, resulting in a negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 in the longer term.  The high MRI indicates a high level of risk. The potential data error in the earnings data warrants further investigation.  Investors should carefully weigh the strong fundamentals against the current bearish price action and high risk assessment before making investment decisions.  Additional analysis including a deeper dive into the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape is recommended.
