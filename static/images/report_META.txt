Here's a comprehensive analysis of Meta Platforms Inc. (META) based on the provided data, presented in a report format.

**Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Analysis Report**

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company that owns and operates social networking services, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.

The cumulative return of META is 246.76%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 112.74%.  The difference is 134.0 percentage points.  This places META at the 93.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market benchmark, but this is minor compared to the overall return difference. The beta values vary greatly over time, indicating fluctuating market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **Closing Price:** $594.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $609.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $605.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $590.08

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. This is consistent with the negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-6.6%).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI:** 53.32 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.18 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -6.6% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -0.3% (Long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500)


The current price of $594.25, being below the moving averages and considering the negative PPO, doesn't indicate a significant immediate upward or downward trend. The situation should be observed closely. The expected return of -0.3% suggests that despite the past outperformance, future returns might be only marginally better than the S&P 500 over the long term. This is further supported by the overall fluctuating performance highlighted in the CAGR data of the alpha-beta analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis**

META has shown exceptional past performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend.  While earnings and financial data point to a healthy and growing company, the outlook for future outperformance relative to the market is less certain, with the expected return suggesting only marginal gains over the S&P 500.  The considerable volatility in past performance necessitates caution. A long-term investment approach, as suggested by the analysis, could still be considered, but thorough due diligence and consideration of market conditions are vital. The duplicate data entry requires clarification.  Further investigation into the causes of the fluctuations in Beta and CAGR is recommended before making any investment decisions.
