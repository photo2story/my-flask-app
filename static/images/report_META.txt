## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company specializing in social networking and online advertising.

The cumulative return of META is 294.69%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 119.94%.  The difference is 174.75%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the market benchmark over the observed period.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance relative to the market.  While exhibiting periods of significant outperformance (e.g., 2019-2021), other periods show underperformance (e.g., 2020-2022). The consistently low Alpha values (around 0.1) suggest that the stock's outperformance might be primarily due to its high Beta (market sensitivity) rather than unique managerial skill.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $658.93

* **Expected Return:** 0.1% – This represents a low expected return relative to S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This number needs context. Does this represent an *additional* return above VOO, or the return of META itself? Clarification is needed.

The recent price change (+$0.32) is relatively small and doesn't signal a significant jump or drop.
