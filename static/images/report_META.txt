**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  This indicates that META's performance relative to the market (as measured by beta) and its excess return (alpha) have fluctuated considerably.

However, the negative alpha and high negative CAGR in 2020-2022 highlight periods of significant underperformance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has shown significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent price action indicates a downtrend. While some indicators suggest oversold conditions (RSI), other factors (MRI, PPO, negative expected return) point to continued risk.  The high historical volatility and variable alpha and beta highlight the inherent risk associated with META.  The strong financial performance shown by the revenue and profit margin data is a positive, but needs to be considered alongside the concerning expected return and current price trend.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is crucial for a more complete picture.  Before making any investment decisions, it is recommended to perform thorough due diligence and consult with a financial advisor.
