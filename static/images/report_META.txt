## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Investment Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focusing on social media and related services.  The cumulative return of META is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last day in the provided data is 135.8%.  The relative divergence of 89.7% indicates that META's performance has been substantially above the S&P 500 for a significant portion of the historical period considered.  However, it's crucial to remember that this is a snapshot in time and past performance doesn't guarantee future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $574.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $568.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $570.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $566.47

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum.  However, it's below the last market price of $591.04, indicating a recent pullback.  This price decline is not substantial enough to signal a significant bearish trend based on this limited data.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.64 – This suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.  However, RSI alone is not sufficient for making investment decisions.
* **PPO:** -0.0004 –  A near-zero PPO indicates a neutral to slightly bearish trend in the short term.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:**  NaN (-) This indicates a recent short-term downturn.  The difference between the last market price ($591.04) and the closing price ($574.32) shows a recent pullback, but not a significant "crash."
* **Expected Return:** 69.2% – This represents a significant potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) assuming consistent performance similar to the historical data.  This is a projection and should be viewed cautiously.
