**6. Overall Analysis:**

META demonstrates strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but recent performance is more mixed.  While recent earnings show positive growth and high profit margins, the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-18.1%) and a relatively high Beta suggest significant risk.  Investors should consider the high volatility and market sensitivity before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data point and a deeper dive into the drivers of the negative expected return are recommended.
