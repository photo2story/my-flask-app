**4. Recent Financial Performance & Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows consistent growth in both EPS and revenue. However, more context is needed to fully assess the performance.  Comparing the latest quarter's EPS (6.2) to previous quarters and analyst expectations is crucial for a complete analysis. The provided data lacks analyst expectations and forward-looking guidance. The revenue is consistently above $34 billion.  Further information including earnings per share (EPS) against estimates and future projections is essential for a thorough analysis.

**5. Revenue and Profitability Analysis:**

Revenue has consistently remained above $34B, showing strong revenue generation. Profit margins are consistently high, hovering around 81%, indicating strong profitability.  Equity is also increasing, and ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates between 8% and 9.5%, suggesting reasonable profitability relative to shareholder equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires information from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD within the last two days. Please provide the news articles for analysis.)*  Without specific news articles, this section cannot be completed.  I need the actual news data to assess recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.


**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

META has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed historical period. While recent short-term indicators suggest some bearish momentum (negative PPO and negative relative divergence), the long-term outlook, based on the projected 69% expected return, remains bullish.  However, this projection depends heavily on maintaining past performance.  Consistent revenue growth and high profit margins indicate financial strength. The lack of analyst expectations and recent news (which needs to be provided) prevents a complete assessment of the current market sentiment and short-to-medium term prospects.  A deeper dive into the provided financial data, incorporating analyst predictions and recent news would provide a more nuanced view.
