**6. Overall Conclusion:**

META has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, however, this has been characterized by periods of extreme volatility.  The current RSI of 100 suggests an overbought condition, hinting at potential short-term corrections.  While recent earnings show positive growth, the provided expected return is extremely low and needs further clarification.  A deeper dive into the drivers of past volatility and a more detailed analysis of the provided financial information (including clarification of the duplicate earnings data point) is necessary before making any definitive investment recommendations.  The high beta suggests significant risk associated with META.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the historical volatility and the potential for significant price swings.
