**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $711.99
* **Last Market Price:** $718.49 (0.91% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $701.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $649.98
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $612.88

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 100.0 (extremely overbought, indicating potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.9272 (positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.0 (-) (short-term downward trend)

The recent price increase (0.91%) is noteworthy but needs to be considered in light of the overbought RSI. A significant price correction is possible.  The expected return of 0.3% is very low, potentially suggesting that the market may consider the high RSI and recent volatility. Long-term (2+ years) investment may offer S&P 500 outperformance based on historical analysis (as highlighted by the cumulative return difference), however this requires careful risk assessment given the high volatility exhibited in the past.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, but this has come with high volatility.  Recent price movements show an upward trend, but the extremely overbought RSI suggests a potential correction.  Strong financial performance is evident in both revenue and profitability, however the high valuation coupled with extreme volatility indicates the need for careful risk management.  Further analysis, especially clarifying the duplicated data point in the earnings report, is needed to form a complete investment recommendation.  The high Beta suggests that META is a volatile investment and investors should be prepared for significant price swings.
