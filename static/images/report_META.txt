**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출 (B$) |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-05-01 | 6.59 | 42.31      |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

META has shown significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500, but this performance is not consistently reflected in all periods examined.  While recent earnings and financial information indicate strong financial health, the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 and mixed technical indicators suggest a need for caution.  The recent sharp price increase warrants monitoring for potential short-term volatility.  Further analysis, considering macroeconomic factors and future growth prospects, is recommended before making any investment decisions. The data presented needs further clarification on some duplicate entries and requires a larger sample size for more robust conclusions.
