**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on social networking and online advertising.

The cumulative return of META (287.45%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 116.17%.  The difference of 171.3% points to substantial outperformance, although the relative divergence of 88.6% shows this is within the range of historical volatility in outperformance relative to VOO.

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows inconsistent performance.  While some periods exhibit high CAGR and strong alpha (e.g., 2019-2021, 2022-2024), others show significant negative returns and negative alpha (e.g., 2016-2018, 2020-2022). The high beta values generally indicate high sensitivity to market movements.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows significant growth over the analyzed period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 60.0% | 6.5% | 32.0% | 0.0 | 445.2 |
| 2016-2018  | -22.0% | 9.7% | -40.0% | 0.1 | 330.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 27.0% | 9.7% | -3.0% | 1.5 | 517.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 30.0% | 12.3% | 2.0% | 0.5 | 689.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 85.0% | 12.3% | 0.4 | 848.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -76.0% | 32.3% | -85.0% | 0.4 | 303.6 |
| 2021-2023  | 38.0% | 32.3% | 15.0% | 1.9 | 893.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 138.0% | 32.3% | 1.9 | 1482.9 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $668.20
* **Last Market Price:** $668.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $665.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $698.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $644.87

The price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change is minimal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.80 (Oversold; potential bounce, but not a confirmation of an upturn)
* **PPO:** -1.38 (Negative; indicates bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.2% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 1.2% (Long-term (2+ years) expected outperformance vs. S&P 500)

The low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum.  The recent small price decrease doesn't indicate a significant event. The expected return suggests potential for long-term outperformance, but this must be considered in the context of volatility shown in the alpha/beta analysis.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent growth in both EPS and revenue.  However, there's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-31.  Assuming one entry is incorrect, the trend indicates strong growth.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | 6.2  | $40.59 B      |

| 2023-10-26 | 4.5  | $34.15 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals strong revenue and profitability with consistent high profit margins (above 80%).  Equity is increasing, and ROE, while fluctuating, generally indicates decent returns on invested capital.  Further analysis would be needed to determine the drivers of these trends.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $48.38B   | 81.73%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $153.17B   | 9.15%   |



**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, although the degree of this outperformance fluctuates greatly.  Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, supported by bearish technical indicators (RSI, PPO).  However, strong earnings growth and high profitability are positive signs.  The relatively high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy might be considered, given the predicted outperformance against the S&P 500, but only after considering the inherent volatility of this stock.  Further due diligence, including a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and competitive landscape, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistent alpha/beta analysis indicates that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the high degree of volatility should be considered.
