**6) Overall Analysis:**

META has shown significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this performance has been volatile.  The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to correction. The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500, coupled with high historical maximum drawdowns, indicates considerable risk. While the company shows strong financial fundamentals with high profit margins and revenue growth, the current market positioning and risk profile warrant caution. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in META, particularly given the projected long-term underperformance compared to the broader market. Further due diligence, including analysis of the company's strategic direction and competitive landscape, is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.
