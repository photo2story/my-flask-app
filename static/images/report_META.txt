## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on building technologies that connect people around the world.

The cumulative return of META is 256.36%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 115.41%.  The difference is 141.0%, placing it at the 96.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates strong relative performance, though past performance does not guarantee future results.  The provided alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market (beta), though this is also subject to the limitations of the historical data provided.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $610.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $612.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $608.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $588.97

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average and slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some recent price consolidation.  The price is significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.95 - This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, although it is closer to oversold territory.
* **PPO:** 0.06 - A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +4.6% - This reflects a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -0.4% -  This indicates a projected long-term (2+ years) underperformance relative to the S&P 500. This should be viewed cautiously as the provided data is limited. The negative return in the context of already strong performance suggests potential for future underperformance relative to the market.

Given that the closing price is approximately $610.72, which is near the moving averages, no extreme price movement (sharp upswing or downswing) is apparent from this limited data.

* **EPS Growth:**  EPS has also increased in the observed period.
