**0. Executive Summary:**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on connecting people through social media platforms.  This report analyzes its recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), examining key financial metrics, and providing a forward-looking perspective.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Meta Platforms Inc. has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.

* **META Cumulative Return:** 327.14%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** 205.3%
* **Relative Divergence:** 100.0% (This signifies that META's performance is at the highest percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500.)

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows substantial volatility year-over-year, ranging from significant losses to extremely high gains. While past performance is not indicative of future results, META's ability to generate exceptionally high returns during certain periods is noteworthy.  The high Beta values in some periods suggest significant sensitivity to market movements.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 60.0% | 6.5% | 32.0% | 0.0 | 445.4 |
| 2016-2018  | -22.0% | 9.7% | -40.0% | 0.1 | 330.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 27.0% | 9.7% | -3.0% | 1.5 | 518.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 30.0% | 12.3% | 2.0% | 0.5 | 689.5 |
| 2019-2021  | 85.0% | 12.3% | 15.0% | 0.4 | 849.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -76.0% | 32.3% | -85.0% | 0.4 | 303.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 38.0% | 32.3% | 15.0% | 1.9 | 893.4 |
| 2022-2024  | 138.0% | 32.3% | 105.0% | 1.9 | 1483.5 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $736.67
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $725.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $684.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $627.49

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The relatively large gap between the closing price and the 60-day average indicates a significant recent price increase.  The price change from the previous close ($1.11) is relatively small compared to the overall price level.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 100.0 (Extremely overbought, suggesting potential for a correction)
* **PPO:** 0.3461 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 0.6% (This is a relatively low expected return, considering the historical outperformance)

The extremely high RSI value warrants caution, suggesting the potential for a price pullback.  The positive PPO confirms recent upward momentum, but the negative relative divergence change raises a concern about short term potential. The relatively low expected return may reflect the already high valuation, despite the historical outperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a clear upward trend in both EPS and revenue.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-31 | 6.2 | 40.59 B$ |
| 2024-08-01 | 5.31 | 39.07 B$ |
| 2024-04-25 | 4.86 | 36.45 B$ |
| 2023-10-26 | 4.5 | 34.15 B$ |
| 2024-10-31 | 4.5 | 34.15 B$ |


There appears to be a duplication of data for October 31, 2024.  Assuming this is an error and using the other data points, the trend is positive and substantial.  Further analysis would require access to the full dataset and understanding of any one-time events.


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability tables show consistent and strong performance. Profit margins remain consistently high, and equity is growing steadily.  ROE is also generally increasing, showing a healthy return on investment.  However, a more in-depth analysis is needed to understand factors contributing to these trends.

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $48.38B | 81.73% |
| 2024-09-30 | $40.59B | 81.83% |
| 2024-06-30 | $39.07B | 81.30% |
| 2024-03-31 | $36.45B | 81.79% |
| 2023-12-31 | $40.11B | 80.82% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $182.64B | 11.41% |
| 2024-09-30 | $164.53B | 9.54% |
| 2024-06-30 | $156.76B | 8.59% |
| 2024-03-31 | $149.53B | 8.27% |
| 2023-12-31 | $153.17B | 9.15% |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

META has demonstrated significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent earnings show strong growth. However, the extremely high RSI indicates an overbought condition, suggesting potential for near-term correction.  While long-term prospects seem positive based on earnings and financial data, the high valuation and current market conditions warrant caution.  Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios and carefully manage their risk.  The provided expected return is relatively low, which is likely due to the already high valuation of META.  Further research, including fundamental analysis and assessment of the competitive landscape, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  This analysis should not be considered investment advice.
