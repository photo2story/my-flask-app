2025-02-19 - Analysis Report
## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Preliminary Analysis:**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company specializing in social networking and online advertising.  The provided data shows significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO).  However, this requires deeper analysis considering volatility and potential for regression.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **META Cumulative Return:** 327.14%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** 205.3% (This is the difference in cumulative returns between META and VOO as of the last data point)
* **Relative Divergence:** 100.0% (This indicates META is at the highest point of its historical relative performance compared to VOO based on the provided min/max range.)

The table shows significant variability in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), Alpha, and Beta over different time periods. While META has shown periods of substantial outperformance (e.g., 2023-2025 projected 330% CAGR), it has also experienced significant drawdowns (e.g., 2020-2022 -76% CAGR).  This highlights the risk associated with investing in META, despite its high growth potential.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $736.67
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $725.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $684.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $627.49

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish short-term trend. However, the relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages implies the upward momentum may be weakening.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 100.0 –  This extremely high RSI value suggests the stock is significantly overbought and potentially due for a correction.
* **PPO:** 0.3461 –  A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum, but the magnitude is relatively moderate.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** 0.0 (-) –  This indicates a recent short-term slowdown in the relative outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  There's no indication of a sudden spike in divergence.
* **Expected Return:** 0.6% –  This represents a modest long-term (2+ years) expected excess return over the S&P 500. This is a low value, considering the high historical returns. This may suggest a correction is priced into the expected return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue        |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-10-31 | 6.2  | $40.59 Billion |
| 2024-08-01 | 5.31 | $39.07 Billion |
| 2024-04-25 | 4.86 | $36.45 Billion |
| 2023-10-26 | 4.5  | $34.15 Billion |
| 2024-10-31 | 4.5  | $34.15 Billion | *(Note: This appears to be a duplicate entry)*


Earnings have shown a steady increase in both EPS and revenue over the past few quarters.  However, the data needs to be confirmed.  The apparent duplication needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further information is required for a complete assessment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance is characterized by high volatility and periods of substantial drawdowns. Currently, the stock shows signs of being overbought (RSI = 100), despite positive earnings and above-average moving averages. The low expected excess return, given the historical data, warrants caution.  Before making an investment decision, further investigation is crucial, particularly regarding the missing financial data and clarification of duplicate earnings entries.  Consideration should also be given to the risk profile associated with META's historical volatility.  The potential for a significant correction should be factored into any investment strategy.
