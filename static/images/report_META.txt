**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $689.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $677.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $631.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $604.15

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.  The recent price change ($0.32 increase) is relatively small compared to the overall price.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 78.60  (High RSI suggests the stock might be overbought.)
* **PPO:** 1.13 (Positive PPO indicates a bullish signal, although the value itself requires context to properly interpret).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) indicating a recent short-term decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 0.2% (This is a very low long-term expected return for a stock exhibiting such high volatility.  The context is missing, and this figure needs careful verification and interpretation.)

The high RSI coupled with a recent slight price decline may suggest a potential short-term correction.  The 0.2% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term needs additional justification given the historical data's volatility.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

META has shown a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this has come with significant volatility. Recent earnings data suggests continued revenue and profit growth. However, technical indicators (high RSI) suggest a potential short-term correction.  The provided expected return of 0.2% seems unusually low given the historical volatility and growth trends. Further investigation and clarification are needed regarding data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) and the low projected long-term return before making any investment decisions.  A thorough understanding of the company's future growth prospects and risk factors is crucial before committing to a long-term investment.
