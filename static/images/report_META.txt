**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -76.0% | 32.3%  | -75.0% | 1.0   | 302.6  |
| 2021-2023  | 38.0%  | 32.3%  | 29.0% | 1.0   | 890.2  |
| 2022-2024  | 138.0% | 32.3%  | 115.0% | 1.0   | 1478.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 281.0% | 11.2%  | 238.0% | 1.0   | 1634.6 |


Note that the negative Alpha in 2020-2022 contradicts the overall positive performance. This suggests that the Alpha calculation might be based on a different benchmark or methodology than the cumulative return calculation. Further investigation is needed to reconcile this discrepancy.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $647.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $627.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $611.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $595.96

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The recent price change of $1.73 represents a slight increase from the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 66.98 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 11.8% (above S&P 500)

The recent price increase is moderate and does not signal a significant rapid movement (either up or down). The positive PPO and the positive divergence confirm the upward trend, but the RSI nearing overbought suggests caution.  The high expected return indicates significant potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term.

Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence and consider your own risk tolerance.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings date) warrant further investigation into the data source's reliability.
