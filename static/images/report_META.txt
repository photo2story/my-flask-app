Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on social networking and online advertising.

The cumulative return of META is 252.07%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.39%.  The difference is 133.7%, placing it at the 93.7th percentile of its historical relative divergence against the S&P 500.  This indicates that META's performance has been substantially higher than the S&P 500 over the period considered.

The historical alpha and beta values show significant volatility and varying levels of outperformance against the market.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

This is significantly lower than the past performance.  This discrepancy requires further investigation. The value of -0.6 may refer to a relative divergence rather than a direct percentage return prediction.)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent revenue growth and increasing EPS across the reported quarters.  However, there's an apparent duplication of the October 31st, 2024 data which needs clarification.  Assuming the duplicated data is an error, the following observations can be made:


* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has shown consistent growth throughout the reported period.
* **EPS Growth:**  EPS has also exhibited consistent growth.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which are not provided in the initial data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has shown strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, however, the recent technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downward trend. While the company exhibits healthy financial fundamentals with increasing revenue, EPS, and equity, the relatively low expected return (compared to historical performance) and negative PPO value warrant caution. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a complete evaluation of current market sentiment and potential future performance. Further investigation into the reasons behind the divergence between past performance and the predicted long-term return is recommended.  Clarification on the duplicated earnings data is also necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.
