## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on connecting people and building communities through its various platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

The cumulative return of META is 259.71%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.36%. The difference is 139.35 percentage points.  The provided relative divergence of 95.6% indicates that META's performance relative to the S&P 500 is in the top 95.6% of its historical range.  This suggests strong outperformance, but the relative divergence metric should be considered in conjunction with other factors.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance with high volatility. While periods of exceptionally high CAGR are observed (e.g., 2019-2021, 2023-2025), others show significant losses (e.g., 2020-2022).  The relatively consistent alpha of 0.1 suggests some degree of manager skill, but the high beta (around 0.1 across all periods - note that this is an unusually low beta for a high-growth technology stock, which typically have higher betas.  It's possible there is a mistake in the provided data. Check your data source.) indicates high sensitivity to market movements. The extremely high MDD in certain periods signifies substantial risk. The market capitalization remains consistent at $1556 billion throughout the analyzed years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $616.46
* **5-day Moving Average:** $610.38
* **20-day Moving Average:** $605.355
* **60-day Moving Average:** $592.5625

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the moving averages suggests the uptrend is not particularly strong.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.99 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.0064 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though very weak)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -1.3% (Short-term bearish divergence)

The slight price increase compared to the previous close is not significant enough to signal a dramatic surge (rapid increase). The expected return of -0.1% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) suggests potential underperformance compared to the market index.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a clear upward trend in both EPS and revenue.  There is inconsistency in the data. The 2024-10-31 entry appears twice with different EPS numbers. This inconsistency needs clarification before drawing meaningful conclusions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, but this has been characterized by periods of high volatility and significant drawdowns.  While recent earnings show growth, there are inconsistencies in the data that need to be addressed. The relatively low beta (assuming the provided number is correct) needs further investigation. The technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, but the expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative.  Further analysis, including a review of the company's future prospects, competitive landscape, and potential risks, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistencies in the provided data need to be resolved.
