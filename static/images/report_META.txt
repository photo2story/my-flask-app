**1) Return Rate Comparison and Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Meta Platforms Inc. is a company that develops and operates social media platforms and technologies (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.).
*   **Cumulative Return (META):** 109.21%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 91.40%
*   **Divergence:** Current: 4.1, Relative Divergence: 54.7

**Analysis:**

*   META has outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly in terms of cumulative return.
*   The "Divergence" metrics suggest that, while META is currently above VOO,  the "current divergence" is relatively low (4.1) within its historical range. The relative divergence of 54.7 indicates it's slightly above the median historical divergence. This suggests that while META is outperforming VOO, the difference isn't at its highest point historically, and it shows that it is in the middle stage of the minimum-maximum fluctuation range.

| 2023-2025  | 132.0% | 97.4% | 70.0%  | 1.5  | 1663.8 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows significant volatility in Meta's performance over different periods, with some periods showing negative growth and others showing substantial growth (e.g., 132% for 2023-2025).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently very high, indicating substantial risk and price volatility over these periods.  It consistently hovers near 99%, which is extremely concerning.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is inconsistent, with significant negative alpha in earlier periods indicating underperformance relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark. However, the last few periods show very strong positive alpha, especially in 2022-2025 and 2023-2025, showing increased outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently above 1, indicating that META is more volatile than the market. In recent periods (2021-2025 and 2022-2024), the Beta is significantly higher (1.7), suggesting META is highly sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** The Market Capitalization fluctuates, demonstrating periods of contraction, like from 2020-2022, and also exponential growth in recent periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 660.09
*   **Last-market:** Price: 660.09, Previous Close: 666.01, Change: -0.89
*   **5-day SMA:** 663.11
*   **20-day SMA:** 658.24
*   **60-day SMA:** 664.44

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price has seen a slight decrease in the last trading session.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which *could* be interpreted as a short-term bullish signal. However, the 60-day SMA is above both, suggesting the longer-term trend is still upward, although there might be some short-term consolidation.  The fact that the closing price is below all three SMAs indicates some possible near-term downward pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 55.99
*   **PPO:** 0.16

*   **Expected Return (%):** 55.41%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI score suggests that, based on the model, Meta is considered a relatively safe investment at the moment.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 55.99 is neutral. It's neither overbought (above 70) nor oversold (below 30).
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.16 suggests that the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, showing weak upside momentum, but not enough to indicate any momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This suggests a strong "Buy" recommendation, allocating all available cash to purchasing the stock with the given conditions.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Indicates positive short-term momentum and a recent uptrend relative to its benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return (55.41%) is a very positive signal.
