**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $6.2    | $40.59 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | $5.31   | $39.07 B      |

Earnings have shown a consistent upward trend in recent quarters.  The duplicate entry for October 31, 2024, needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing data is a significant limitation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this has been characterized by high volatility. While recent earnings are positive and the short-term price action suggests a bullish trend, the extremely high RSI suggests the stock is overbought and prone to a correction. The lack of comprehensive financial data hinders a more robust assessment.  Further investigation into the methodology behind the expected return, clarifying the duplicated earnings data and obtaining missing financial information are crucial for a more complete and reliable analysis.  Investors should proceed with caution, considering the inherent risk associated with META's volatility.
