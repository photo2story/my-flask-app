| 2023-2025  | 119.0%  | 72.7% | 60.0%   | 1.3    | 1497.8  |

*   **CAGR:** Varies significantly year to year, indicating volatility. Recent years (2022-2025) show strong growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating substantial potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Fluctuates, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to a benchmark.  The recent periods (2022-2025) display very strong alpha generation.
*   **Beta:** Generally low (near zero or negative), indicating low correlation with the overall market *except* the last period which shows META's price is very correlated to the overall market. A negative Beta suggest that META's price tends to move in the opposite direction of the market, although the values are so low that this is not likely to be accurate.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization):** Shows substantial growth over the period, particularly in the later years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 594.25

*   **5-day SMA:** 594.684
*   **20-day SMA:** 638.9735
*   **60-day SMA:** 705.7698

*   **Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day, 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a possible short-term downtrend. The fact that the 5-day SMA is greater than the current price and the current price is just negligibly greater than the previous close shows that the price is trending down, very slowly and negligibly over the past 5 days.
