The addition of real-time market outlook, analyst opinions and recent earnings news will refine this analysis, making a buy/sell/hold recommendation possible. The 4.79% expected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 suggests the potential for continued outperformance, assuming current market conditions remain relatively stable.  However,  risk associated with higher Beta should be considered.
