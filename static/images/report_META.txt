**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, as evidenced by its substantially higher cumulative returns.

The high expected return, combined with the current price and indicators, suggests a potential opportunity for long-term investors, but short-term volatility should be considered.
