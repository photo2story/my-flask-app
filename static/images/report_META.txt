**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500,  with strong revenue and earnings growth.

Current technical indicators suggest positive momentum but also highlight the risk of a short-term correction due to RSI levels approaching overbought territory. The provided 0.0% expected return requires further investigation and should not be considered a reliable long-term prediction.  Thorough due diligence and consideration of the inherent risks associated with individual stock investment are crucial before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment approach with careful monitoring is recommended.  Further analysis incorporating external factors and macroeconomic conditions is advised.
