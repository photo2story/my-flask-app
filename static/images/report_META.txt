The projected long-term outperformance, while positive, needs to be considered with the inherent risks associated with META's volatility.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data point and clarification of the provided data is recommended for a more comprehensive analysis.  Consideration of other relevant factors such as industry trends and competitive landscape would further enhance the review.
