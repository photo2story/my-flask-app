This report analyzes META's performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), considering its recent price movements, financial indicators, and earnings data.  Key findings reveal a significant outperformance versus the S&P 500 historically, but currently showing signs of relative underperformance, warranting further investigation.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows fluctuating performance relative to the market (Beta) and periods of significant outperformance (Alpha).  Noteworthy is the substantial negative CAGR (-77%) in 2020-2022, which significantly impacts the overall picture.  Recent positive CAGR (50% in 2022-2024 and 123% in 2023-2025) suggests a recovery.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing periods of substantial growth, but also experiencing significant downturns. While recent earnings show strong growth and high profitability, the current price is below key moving averages, and technical indicators suggest bearish momentum.  The projected negative long-term expected return, relative to the S&P 500, raises concerns.  The relatively high relative divergence indicates that the current underperformance is unusual relative to historical patterns.  Further analysis is needed to determine whether this is a temporary setback or a shift in the long-term trend.  Careful monitoring of the stock price, technical indicators, and future earnings reports is crucial before making any investment decisions. The inconsistencies in the provided data (repeated October 2023 data) needs resolution to draw more accurate conclusions.
