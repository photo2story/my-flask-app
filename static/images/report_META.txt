**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows consistent revenue growth and strong profit margins.  EPS (Earnings Per Share) is also increasing.  However, the data lacks context regarding analyst expectations.  Comparing the reported earnings with analyst estimates for the most recent quarter (2024-10-31) is crucial to assess the performance against expectations, determining whether the results were a beat or a miss.

**5. Financial Statements Analysis:**

The provided quarterly data reveals consistent high profit margins (around 81%), indicating strong profitability.  ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates but generally remains healthy, though a further breakdown of the components of ROE would provide more insights.  The increase in Equity demonstrates solid financial health.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  To complete this section, I need access to recent news articles (within the last two days), specifically earnings reports from reputable sources like Shacknews or similar financial news outlets.  Analysis of FINBOLD, recent market outlook, and analyst opinions are also required to provide a comprehensive overview of current market sentiment and future expectations.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

META has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the long term, as evidenced by a substantial cumulative return exceeding that of VOO.  While recent technical indicators suggest some short-term bearishness, the company demonstrates strong fundamental performance with consistent revenue growth, high profit margins, and increasing EPS.  A thorough examination of recent earnings reports against analyst estimates, along with current news and analyst opinions, is essential to provide a more precise and current assessment of META's investment prospects.  The expected long-term return of 4.86% over the S&P 500 needs further investigation concerning its calculation to determine its reliability.

**8. Recommendation:**

A full investment recommendation cannot be made without access to the missing news articles, analyst opinions, and a detailed breakdown of the expected return calculation.  However, based on the available data, META shows strong long-term performance and healthy fundamentals.  Further research into the current market sentiment, upcoming catalysts, and potential risks is crucial before making any investment decision.
