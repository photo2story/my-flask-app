2025-01-24 - Analysis Report
## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company specializing in social networking and online advertising.

The cumulative return of META is 271.36%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.83%.  The difference is 148.5%, placing it at the 99.3rd percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max). This indicates a strong relative performance historically.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows highly volatile performance, ranging from -10% to 290% depending on the period.  While recent years show impressive growth, the substantial negative CAGR in 2020-2022 highlights significant risk.  The high Beta values (above 1) further indicate that META's price is more volatile than the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $636.45
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $620.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $609.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $594.72

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The recent increase from the previous close ($623.50 to $636.45) shows a positive change of 2.08%, which doesn't signal a dramatic price jump (no rapid surge or fall).


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 67.59  - Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, potentially indicating a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.28 - A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** 2.0 (+) - Indicates a short-term upward trend.

The provided expected return of -0.0% is puzzling given the historical outperformance. It's crucial to clarify the methodology and assumptions behind this prediction.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy, while potentially rewarding given historical trends, carries substantial risk due to META's volatility. This return doesn't account for potential future growth or decline.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a consistent increase in both EPS and revenue over the past few quarters.  However, there's a duplication of data for October 31st, 2024. This needs clarification. The trend suggests healthy growth in the company's financial performance.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | 6.2 | 40.59          |
| 2024-08-01 | 5.31 | 39.07          |
| 2024-04-25 | 4.86 | 36.45          |
| 2023-10-26 | 4.5  | 34.15          |
| 2023-10-31  | 4.5  | 34.15         |  *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability metrics demonstrate strong and consistent performance throughout the reported quarters. Profit margins are high and relatively stable, indicating efficient operations.  Equity growth also mirrors revenue expansion, highlighting strong financial health.  ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates but remains consistently positive.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has shown remarkable growth exceeding the S&P 500 significantly over the provided period. However, its high volatility, reflected in the large swings in CAGR and Beta, signifies substantial risk.  While recent earnings and financial data appear positive, the overbought RSI and the need for clarification on the expected return and duplicated data points warrant caution.  A long-term investment might be considered, but only with a high risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the company's future prospects and potential market downturns.  Further investigation into the causes of the extreme volatility and the methodology of the expected return calculation is crucial before making any investment decision.
