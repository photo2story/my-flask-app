**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant volatility in Alpha and Beta across different periods.  This suggests META's performance is not consistently correlated with the overall market.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META shows strong underlying financial performance with consistent revenue growth and high profit margins. However, the recent stock price decline and bearish technical indicators suggest a cautious outlook in the short term.  The significant divergence between the strong fundamentals and the current market price warrants further investigation into factors such as market sentiment, future growth expectations, and overall macroeconomic conditions.  While past performance is not indicative of future results,  the long-term potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500 remains possible, contingent upon successful execution of META's strategies and favorable market conditions.  A thorough assessment of the company's future prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.
