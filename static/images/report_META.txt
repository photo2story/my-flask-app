While exhibiting periods of strong outperformance (high CAGR and positive Alpha), there are also periods of significant underperformance (negative CAGR and negative Alpha), coupled with high maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The Beta fluctuates, suggesting sensitivity to overall market movements, but the relatively low Alpha suggests the outperformance isn't entirely due to skill.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated strong long-term growth significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn. While the company's financial fundamentals appear robust, with strong revenue and profit margins, the short-term technical indicators are bearish. The high expected return is promising for long-term investors, but it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent market risk and the volatility indicated by the historical Alpha/Beta data.  More information on recent news and analyst sentiment is needed for a complete assessment.  The high profit margins are reassuring but the volatility needs to be considered.
