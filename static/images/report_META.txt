**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 569.2 (Last market: 569.44)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 566.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 570.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 565.5

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and slightly above the 5 and 60 day moving averages, suggesting a period of consolidation or minor price correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.48 (Suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially indicating a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.11 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -8.9% (Indicates recent downward price momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 69.2% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is predicted over a long-term horizon).  This number needs more context, like the methodology used to arrive at this prediction.

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO, combined with the negative 20-day relative strength change, paint a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the other indicators point toward bearish momentum in the short term. The 569.44 closing price doesn't show any significant jump or drop recently. The long-term expected return is substantial, although this requires validation through further analysis of the prediction method's reliability.
