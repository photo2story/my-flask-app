**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has shown strong recent performance, outperforming the S&P 500 significantly. However, this needs to be considered in the context of its historical volatility and the currently negative short-term expected return. The technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest a bearish short-term trend, while the company's financial statements demonstrate strong revenue growth and profitability.  The conflicting signals indicate a need for caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative expected return and clarification of the duplicated earnings data point are necessary before making any investment decisions.  Long-term investors might consider the potential for recovery given META's strong fundamentals, but should closely monitor market conditions and the company's future performance.
