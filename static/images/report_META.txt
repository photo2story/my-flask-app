**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $585.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $529.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $579.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $636.96

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downward trend.  The significant price change from the previous close ($14.76) suggests a recent rapid upward movement (a "jump").

* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +4.5% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -13.1%  This indicates a negative expected return, although it’s unclear the time horizon for this prediction.  The statement about long-term outperformance against the S&P 500 needs clarification on the methodology used to arrive at that conclusion.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has shown strong performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the observed period.  However, this outperformance is not consistently reflected in the alpha values across all timeframes.  High beta values indicate significant market sensitivity. Recent price action shows a short-term uptrend but may be below a longer-term trend.  The high MRI value suggests a high-risk environment.  Earnings show consistent growth, but the provided data has inconsistencies that need clarification.  While financial indicators suggest a healthy company, the -13.1% expected return warrants further investigation and careful consideration of the underlying assumptions and methodology.  A more thorough analysis requires more complete and consistent data, as well as a deeper dive into the company’s future prospects and competitive landscape.
