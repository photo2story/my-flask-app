**7. Overall Analysis:**

META demonstrates exceptionally strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, driven by consistent revenue and profit growth.  However, the substantial volatility observed in the CAGR data highlights the inherent risk in this stock. The current price is above key moving averages, but RSI suggests potential for a short-term correction.  Fundamental analysis shows strong financial health.  Long-term investment with careful risk management is advisable, considering the historical volatility.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data point is necessary. The lack of a specific quantitative expected return should be considered in the investment decision.
