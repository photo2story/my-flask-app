**7. Overall Analysis:**

META shows strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent earnings are positive, and financial health appears robust.  However, the short-term expected return is slightly negative, and the beta reveals substantial market sensitivity, implying higher risk. The provided long-term expected return needs further clarification.  The substantial historical outperformance warrants further investigation into the sustainability of this trend, considering the volatility observed in past years.  A thorough risk assessment considering the high beta periods and potential market corrections is crucial.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data requires resolution.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into valuation metrics and a broader economic outlook, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
