The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not specified beyond a qualitative assessment of potential outperformance.

The substantial price drop from the previous close (-3.35) signals potential for further downward movement or a possible bounce.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but this outperformance is not consistent. The recent price action suggests a bearish trend, supported by negative PPO and a low RSI.  While earnings and revenue are growing, the negative short-term expected return and medium market risk highlight the volatility inherent in META.  The significant price drop needs further investigation to determine if it's a temporary correction or signals a more substantial shift.  Long-term investment potential might exist, given the possibility of outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this should be approached cautiously considering the risks involved.  Further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Clarification on the duplicate entry in the earnings data is crucial for a complete analysis.
