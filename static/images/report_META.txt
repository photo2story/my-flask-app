**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has shown substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500 historically, although recent technical indicators point towards short-term downward pressure.  Despite a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500, the strong revenue and earnings growth, high profit margin, and increasing equity suggest a fundamentally sound company with long-term growth potential. However, the significant volatility indicated by the provided beta values and MDD highlights the inherent risk.  Further analysis is needed, incorporating recent news and analyst opinions, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the current market sentiment and future prospects.  The oversold RSI may present a buying opportunity for long-term investors, but caution is warranted due to the negative expected return and volatility.
