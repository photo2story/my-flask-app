* **20-day moving average:** $577.30 (above the current price, suggesting a short-term downtrend)

The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not clearly specified, though past performance suggests potential for outperformance, subject to significant market risk given the high Beta.  The negative expected return is primarily due to the current market sentiment and recent price action.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

META has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but this performance is volatile.  Recent price action shows a significant drop, reflected in negative short-term indicators (RSI, PPO, expected return).  However, strong financial fundamentals (increasing revenue, high profit margins, growing equity) suggest a potentially positive long-term outlook.  The high Beta highlights significant market risk.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in META.  The recent price drop warrants further investigation into potential underlying causes.  Further analysis including future earnings estimates and market sentiment is recommended before making any investment decisions.
