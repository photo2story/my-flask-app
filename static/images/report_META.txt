## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Meta Platforms Inc. (META) is a technology company focusing on social networking and online advertising.  The cumulative return of META is 243.68%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 115.09%. The difference in cumulative returns is 128.6%, placing it at the 91.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a strong outperformance compared to the market benchmark. The provided alpha consistently sits around 0.1, indicating a slight outperformance compared to the market (beta is high, indicating high market sensitivity).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $585.51
* **Last Market Price:** $596.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $597.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $609.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $586.92

The stock price is currently below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential support. The difference between the last market price and the closing price suggests a minor price increase since the close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.36 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.66 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -2.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -0.6% (Long-term expected return relative to S&P 500. This number requires further context to fully interpret, e.g., risk-adjusted return).

The RSI and PPO values both point towards bearish sentiment.  The negative 20-day relative divergence confirms a recent downward trend.  The negative expected return suggests that the future return may underperform the S&P 500, despite historical outperformance.  The provided expected return should be carefully considered within the context of the given risk factors.  The fact that Last Market is higher than closing price might indicate a small upturn (not necessarily a "sharp rebound")


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a clear upward trend in both EPS and Revenue.  However, note that Oct 31st, 2024 shows duplicate entries.  Assuming the duplicate is an error and using only unique entries for analysis:

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue shows consistent quarter-over-quarter growth, demonstrating a positive trend.
* **EPS Growth:** EPS has also grown consistently quarter-over-quarter, further supporting the positive growth trend.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Both Revenue and Profitability tables show stable and growing revenue, with high profit margins remaining consistently above 80%.  Capital (Equity) has also shown consistent growth, and ROE has fluctuated, but remains within a reasonable range.  These metrics paint a picture of a financially healthy company.
