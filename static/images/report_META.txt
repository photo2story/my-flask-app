**6. Overall Summary:**

META has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent price action indicates a potential downtrend, supported by indicators like RSI and PPO. While financial statements suggest robust revenue and profitability, the contradictory expected return and inconsistent Alpha/Beta suggest significant volatility and risk.  The conflicting earnings data requires clarification.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk indicated by the MRI and the negative long-term expected return before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence and analysis are strongly recommended.
