* **Price Change:** A small positive change (0.40%) suggests a slight upward movement; no significant spike.
* **Expected Return:** 0.4% - This represents a very low expected return for a single period, and doesn't fully reflect the overall long-term projection.  The analysis needs to better quantify the long-term S&P 500 outperformance over a 2+ year timeframe based on the historical data provided.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META exhibits a strong track record of outperformance against the S&P 500, displaying considerable growth in revenue and earnings.  High profit margins and increasing equity demonstrate sound financial fundamentals. However, the extremely high RSI suggests the stock is overbought and potentially vulnerable to a correction.  The substantial volatility observed throughout the provided historical data highlights inherent risk.  While the long-term outlook appears positive based on recent performance, investors should be aware of this risk and consider diversification strategies.  A more comprehensive analysis, including a deeper dive into valuation metrics (like P/E ratio) and future growth projections, would be necessary to provide a more complete investment recommendation.  The provided 'Expected Return' requires further refinement to provide meaningful long-term projections relative to the S&P 500.
