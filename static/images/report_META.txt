## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on social networking and online advertising.  The cumulative return of META is 262.99%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.40%. The difference is 142.6%, placing it at the 99.7th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial level of outperformance.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The provided Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a relatively small degree of outperformance compared to a benchmark adjusted for market risk (Beta).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $619.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $615.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $583.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $577.86

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates relatively stable recent price action.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 76.52  (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction.)
* **PPO:** 0.87 (Positive value indicates upward momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +1.1 (Indicates short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 53.9% (This represents expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.)

The high RSI warrants caution, suggesting the possibility of a near-term pullback. However, the positive PPO and strong relative strength suggest continued upward momentum in the longer term.  The closing price of $619.55 is very close to the reported closing price of $619.32, therefore no significant price jumps or crashes have occurred recently.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent revenue and EPS growth from Q1 2023 to Q3 2024.  Specifically:

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue shows consistent growth, though the increase from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 is less significant.
* **EPS Growth:** EPS has also shown consistent growth over the same period.
* **Notable Changes:**  The data shows a clear upward trend in both revenue and EPS.  There is a discrepancy in the October 31st, 2024 data where two rows appear with identical entries. It is unclear whether these are reported twice or are from different sources, therefore that data is treated as only one valid entry in the analysis.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows strong and consistent growth across the reported quarters. Profit margins are consistently high, hovering around 81%, indicating strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been increasing, alongside a generally increasing ROE, although there is some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter.  This suggests strong financial health.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

META shows strong performance relative to the S&P 500, with consistent revenue and EPS growth, high profit margins, and increasing equity.  However, the high RSI suggests potential short-term volatility.  Long-term investors may find the expected return relative to the S&P 500 compelling, but it is critical to be aware of the high RSI and potentially overbought conditions which could lead to a short-term correction.  Further analysis of current news and market sentiment is recommended before making any investment decisions.
