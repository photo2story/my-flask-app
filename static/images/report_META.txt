The difference is 150.8%, placing it at the 89.4th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a historical range of 179.5% to -92.3%).

However,  the relatively high volatility and recent bearish indicators warrant cautious monitoring.  Investors considering a long-term (2+ years) investment should carefully weigh the potential for significant returns against the risk of short-term market fluctuations. The duplicate earnings data entry needs clarification before a complete assessment can be finalized.
