**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $531.62
* **Previous Close:** $583.93
* **Change:** -$8.96 (a significant decrease)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $570.93
* **20-day Moving Average:** $595.57
* **60-day Moving Average:** $642.52

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The significant daily change (-$8.96) suggests a potential short-term bearish pressure.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 29.26 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.57 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.4% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1.7% (long-term, relative to S&P 500)

The combination of a low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests bearish momentum.  However, the over-sold RSI level could indicate a potential short-term price rebound. The significant daily price drop needs to be further investigated for underlying causes.  The expected return is positive but needs further analysis of risk.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | 6.2   | $40.59B       |

There's a duplicate entry for October 31, 2024.  Assuming this is an error and using the other data points, we see a clear upward trend in both EPS and revenue over the past year.  Further investigation is required to confirm data accuracy.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

META has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term,  demonstrating periods of strong growth and high profitability.  However, recent price action shows a substantial drop, placing the stock below its moving averages and suggesting short-term bearish pressure.  Technical indicators show an over-sold condition (RSI) but also negative momentum (PPO and relative divergence). The recent earnings show solid growth, supporting long-term bullish sentiment.  The high profit margins and increasing ROE further support this.  Further investigation into the cause of the recent price drop is crucial.  While the long-term outlook seems positive (indicated by the expected return and fundamental strength), investors should monitor the short-term volatility and assess their risk tolerance before making investment decisions.  Addressing the duplicate data entry and investigating the cause of the sharp price drop is necessary for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis.
