**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

META has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term, but this comes with substantial volatility as reflected in the high beta and MDD.  Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, reinforced by negative momentum indicators (PPO) and an oversold RSI, although short-term relative divergence indicates upward momentum. High revenue and profit margins suggest strong underlying financial health.  However, the high market risk indicator and negative short-term expected return, along with conflicting earnings data, warrant caution.  Further investigation into the conflicting earnings data and a clear definition of the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility inherent in META necessitates a careful risk assessment before any investment.
