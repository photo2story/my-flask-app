* **Last Market Price:** 607.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 599.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 603.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 585.43

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent upward momentum, but below the longer-term 60-day moving average.  The difference between the last market price and closing price suggests a possible recent price fluctuation.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** 61.4% (Significant outperformance projected over 2+ years)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO indicate some bearish pressure, although the RSI is not deeply in oversold territory. The negative change in relative strength confirms short-term weakness. However, the long-term expected return remains significantly positive.  The higher Last-Market price compared to the closing price suggests possible recent upward price movement, but further analysis is needed to confirm whether this constitutes a sharp rebound.
