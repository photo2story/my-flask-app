The provided data shows significant volatility in META's performance, with CAGR ranging from -10% to 277% across different periods.

Further analysis with a longer-term dataset is needed to draw definitive conclusions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

META shows significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the period considered, with high cumulative returns. However, the data reveals substantial volatility, both in terms of returns and risk measures (MDD).  The relatively low Beta suggests a degree of independence from market movements, but the short time frame limits the reliability of this assessment.  Fundamental analysis shows strong revenue and profitability, but the provided data requires clarification (duplicate entries) for a complete assessment.  The expected return of -0.2% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term requires further investigation and should be considered cautiously.  Further analysis with a longer time horizon, including consideration of future market conditions and company-specific factors, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
