**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided, preventing a complete financial analysis.  Further data is needed.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly in the last year. However, the extremely high RSI (100) suggests the stock is significantly overbought and may be due for a correction.  The recent upward trend in earnings is positive, but the lack of comprehensive financial data limits a thorough assessment.  The low expected return of 0.6% is inconsistent with the substantial outperformance noted earlier and requires further examination.  The data provided contains inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings), requiring verification before drawing definitive conclusions.  Further investigation into the data sources and calculation methods is crucial for a more robust analysis.
