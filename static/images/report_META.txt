**1. Performance Comparison:**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company that develops and provides social media products and services. Over the period analyzed, META significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a cumulative return of 95.48% compared to VOO's 82.57%.  The 12.9% difference reflects a strong relative performance, although the relative divergence metric highlights this outperformance is within the upper range of its historical variability against the S&P 500.


**2. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show considerable volatility in META's performance relative to the market.  While positive alpha values (e.g., 2019-2021) indicate outperformance, negative alpha values (e.g., 2020-2022, 2021-2023) signify underperformance. The beta fluctuates significantly, suggesting sensitivity to market movements that varies over time.  Note that the high CAGR in 2023-2025 should be viewed with caution, as it represents a projection, not realized results.


**3. Recent Price Movement:**

META's current price is below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The 5-day moving average being significantly lower than the current price further reinforces this.


**4. RSI and PPO Indicators:**

The RSI of 50.28 is near the neutral level (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  The PPO of 0.23 suggests a slightly bullish momentum, but this is weak and needs further confirmation.  The negative change in relative divergence (-3.1) points to a recent short-term downward trend. The MRI suggests a medium risk level, indicating caution might be warranted.


**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-05-01 | 6.59    | 42.31 B$      |
| 2024-10-31 | 6.20    | 40.59 B$      |
| 2024-08-01 | 5.31    | 39.07 B$      |
| 2024-04-25 | 4.86    | 36.45 B$      |
| 2025-05-01 | 4.86    | 36.45 B$      |

Note: There's a duplicate entry for May 1st, 2025.  This should be clarified.  Overall, the data shows a clear upward trend in both EPS and revenue from Q2 2024 to Q1 2025.


**6. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a complete financial analysis. This crucial missing information significantly limits any deeper insights into META's financial health.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, though recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn.  Positive earnings growth is evident, but the lack of complete financial data hinders a comprehensive assessment. The high volatility, as indicated by the fluctuating alpha and beta, suggests considerable risk.  The negative expected return (-18.1%) relative to the S&P 500 for long-term investors raises concerns.  Further investigation into the missing financial data and a more thorough understanding of the reasons behind the price movement are necessary for a complete and accurate evaluation.  The high relative divergence should be interpreted cautiously as it reflects a range-bound characteristic relative to historical performance, not necessarily future outperformance.
