**2) Recent Price Movement:**

META's closing price is $719.80.  The stock shows a recent upward trend:

* **5-day moving average:** $713.72
* **20-day moving average:** $665.82
* **60-day moving average:** $619.47

The price is above all three moving averages, indicating positive momentum. The recent change of $0.33 suggests a minor uptick.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 100.0 - This extremely high RSI suggests the stock is overbought and potentially due for a correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.578 - A positive PPO indicates upward momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) - Shows a recent slight downturn.

The combination of an extremely high RSI and a small negative divergence suggests a potential short-term pullback is likely.  The small price increase from the previous close is not significant enough to indicate a dramatic change in trend.

The expected return of 0.5% represents a potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500 assuming continued positive momentum and steady growth. This is a very small rate of return.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a consistent increase in both EPS and revenue. However, there's a duplicate entry for October 31st, 2024.  We need clarification on this discrepancy. Assuming the duplicate entry is an error and using the remaining entries:

**6) Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated exceptional performance compared to the S&P 500, showing substantial growth in revenue and earnings.  However, the extremely high RSI suggests the stock is currently overbought, implying a potential short-term correction.  The long-term outlook, based on the strong financial indicators and historical outperformance, remains positive, provided that the current overbought condition is addressed.  A long-term (2+ years) investment approach with a tolerance for potential short-term volatility appears warranted, acknowledging the provided 0.5% expected return is a low figure.  Further analysis considering risk tolerance and diversification strategies is recommended before any investment decision.  Clarification on the duplicate earnings data entry is also needed for a more complete analysis.
