**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on social networking and online advertising.  META significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return far exceeding that of the index.  The high relative divergence suggests this outperformance is notable compared to historical performance relative to the S&P 500.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile alpha and beta values across different time periods. This suggests that META's performance is not consistently correlated with the overall market (as indicated by Beta fluctuations) and has periods of significant outperformance (high Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to market benchmarks.  The high market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects META's significant size in the market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 52.0% | 9.6% | 34.0% | 0.0 | 441.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price shows a recent decline, trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a bearish short-term trend.  The relatively small price change (-$0.91) on the last day does not indicate a significant sudden drop or surge.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI value of 44.45 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity for some investors.  The PPO value of 0.05 is slightly positive, which could be a bullish indicator, but close to neutral. The negative 20-day relative divergence (-1.4) points to a recent short-term decline. The MRI indicates low market risk. The 1.4% expected return represents a projected long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, assuming consistent trends.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a consistent upward trend in both EPS and revenue.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-31 | 6.2 | 40.59 B$ |
| 2024-08-01 | 5.31 | 39.07 B$ |
| 2024-04-25 | 4.86 | 36.45 B$ |
| 2023-10-26 | 4.5 | 34.15 B$ |
| 2024-10-31 | 4.5 | 34.15 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability metrics show strong and consistent performance, although there are some minor fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.  Equity is also increasing, and ROE is generally healthy, indicating a good return on investment.  A slight dip in ROE in Q2 and Q1 2024 compared to Q4 2023 should be considered within the context of overall trends and could be attributed to seasonal factors or other short-term market dynamics.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $48.38B | 81.73% |
| 2024-09-30 | $40.59B | 81.83% |
| 2024-06-30 | $39.07B | 81.30% |
| 2024-03-31 | $36.45B | 81.79% |
| 2023-12-31 | $40.11B | 80.82% |


| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $182.64B | 11.41% |
| 2024-09-30 | $164.53B | 9.54% |
| 2024-06-30 | $156.76B | 8.59% |
| 2024-03-31 | $149.53B | 8.27% |
| 2023-12-31 | $153.17B | 9.15% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, the fundamental data (strong earnings, healthy financial metrics) presents a positive long-term outlook.  The high volatility observed in Alpha and Beta suggests a higher risk profile compared to a more stable investment like VOO.  Investors should consider their risk tolerance and long-term investment horizon before making any decisions.  The 1.4% projected long-term outperformance against the S&P 500 presents a compelling case for long-term investment, but this is just a projection and not a guaranteed outcome.  Further research and due diligence are strongly recommended.
