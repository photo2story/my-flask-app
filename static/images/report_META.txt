## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Meta Platforms Inc. (META) is a technology company focused on social networking and online advertising.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns for META compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with substantial volatility and varying alpha and beta across different periods.  Recent price action shows META trading below its moving averages.  Financial statements show strong revenue and profitability with high profit margins and fluctuating ROE.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **META Cumulative Return:** 268.90%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 108.99%
* **Return Difference:** 159.90% (META outperforms VOO by 159.90%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 84.7% (indicates META's performance is in the upper 84.7th percentile of its historical divergence from VOO).

This indicates that META has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered.  However, the high relative divergence suggests that META's outperformance is also unusually high relative to its historical performance compared to the S&P 500.  Significant volatility is observed in the alpha and beta values over time, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $640.00
* **Previous Close:** $655.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $659.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $694.14
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $646.36

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price drop of $15.05 (from $655.05 to $640.00)  indicates a short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 25.94 (suggests the stock is oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.47 (negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1.5% (This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term investment. The absolute return would be higher.)

The low RSI value and negative PPO suggest that the stock is currently oversold and has bearish momentum.  The negative change in relative divergence further supports this bearish sentiment.  The expected return suggests a positive long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500, but with a relatively modest margin.  The significant price drop of $15.05 might be due to market sentiment or recent news, warranting further investigation.

Both revenue and profit margin show strong and consistent performance.  Equity is also growing steadily, though ROE fluctuates.  The high profit margins are a positive indicator.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  While the company shows strong financial fundamentals with high profitability and growing revenue, the current technical indicators (RSI, PPO) and price movement signal potential downside risk in the short term.  However, the long-term outlook, supported by the expected return of 1.5% above the S&P 500, remains relatively positive.  Further research is needed to understand the reasons for the recent price drop and the duplicate entry in the earnings data.  A thorough analysis of future earnings expectations and macroeconomic factors is crucial before making any investment decisions.
