While META has significantly outperformed VOO overall,  the high volatility and fluctuating alpha and beta suggest considerable risk.  The exceptionally high CAGR in the latest period (2023-2025) needs further investigation for sustainability.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $717.40
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $710.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $660.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $617.22

The price is currently above all three moving averages, indicating a bullish short-term trend.  However, the relatively large gap between the 20-day and 60-day averages suggests potential for correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 100.0 (Extremely overbought, suggesting a potential pullback)
* **PPO:** 0.7026 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend)
* **Price Change (Last Market):**  Positive ($0.40), indicating a slight recent uptick.  This is not considered a significant upward or downward movement.
* **Expected Return:** 0.4% (This appears to be a very low annualized expected return.  It should specify the time horizon.)  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is highly uncertain based on the provided data, but historically META has demonstrated significant outperformance, albeit with high volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |

Earnings have shown a generally upward trend, with strong growth in both EPS and revenue.  However, the apparent duplication in the data needs clarification.

| 2023-12-31 | $153.17B   | 9.15%         |

Both revenue and profitability metrics show consistent strength, though recent growth in Equity and ROE may be slowing.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated exceptionally strong returns compared to the S&P 500, but this performance has been volatile.  The current RSI of 100 suggests the stock is significantly overbought, increasing the likelihood of a short-term correction.  While recent earnings are strong, the high valuation and overbought conditions present a risk.  A long-term investment strategy might be considered, but careful monitoring of technical indicators and potential market corrections is crucial.  The provided "Expected Return" value is too low to be meaningful and needs clarification. Further investigation into the sustainability of recent growth rates is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The discrepancy in the earnings data requires clarification.
