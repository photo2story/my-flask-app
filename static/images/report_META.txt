## Meta Platforms Inc (META) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Meta Platforms Inc. (META) is a technology company focused on social networking and online advertising.  The provided data shows META's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, META's cumulative return is 247.04%, while VOO's is 115.96%.  This represents a difference of 131.1 percentage points.  The relative outperformance (131.1 out of a historical range of 240.9) places META at the 92.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  While this indicates strong historical outperformance, it does not guarantee future results.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows considerable volatility in META's performance over different periods, ranging from a high of 142% to a low of -76%.  Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting slight outperformance relative to the market benchmark, but this needs to be contextualized with Beta values which indicate higher market sensitivity (significantly above 1).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $591.24
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $600.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $609.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $587.09

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  This should be interpreted cautiously as moving averages are lagging indicators.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.41 - This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce. However, it's not a definitive buy signal.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.57 - A negative value suggests bearish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.9 -  Indicates a recent short-term upward trend in relative strength.

* **Expected Return:** -0.6% - This suggests a slightly negative expected return at the current price point.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not clearly defined by the provided data.  Long-term outperformance is implied by the historical data but is not guaranteed. Given the current price is below several moving averages, and considering the negative expected return, there is some short-term downward pressure. However, whether this is a significant issue (급반등, 급하락) requires more data and analysis.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported earnings show a consistent increase in both EPS and revenue over the last few quarters, with the exception of a slight dip between Q2 and Q3 2024.  The most recent quarter (2024-10-31) saw a significant jump in both EPS and Revenue compared to the previous quarter.  No information on expectations is provided for comparison.  Further analysis requires comparing reported numbers against analyst estimates.

* **EPS Trends:** Generally upward trending, demonstrating consistent earnings growth.

**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profit Margins are strong and relatively stable across the provided quarters.  Equity shows a gradual increase over time, and ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates but remains within a healthy range.  These are positive indicators of the company's financial health.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within 2 days) earnings news or analyst opinions are provided.  Further information is required regarding market outlook and recent news events affecting META.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction.  While recent earnings have been positive, showing substantial growth, technical indicators paint a mixed picture with oversold conditions (RSI) and bearish momentum (PPO).  The long-term outlook remains positive if current earnings growth continues and the company maintains its strong financial position. More detailed analysis, including a comparison to analyst estimates, and consideration of current market conditions, are needed to give a complete picture. The significant historical outperformance, despite the short term negativity, warrants further investigation before a conclusive recommendation is made.
