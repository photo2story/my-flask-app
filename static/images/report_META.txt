## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Meta Platforms Inc. (META) is a technology company focused on building technologies that connect people around the world.

The cumulative return of META is 253.0%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 123.86%.  This represents a difference of 129.14%.  The provided relative divergence of 87.13% indicates that META's performance is currently in the upper 87th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  While this suggests strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  Alpha, a measure of excess return, fluctuates between significantly positive and negative values, indicating periods of both substantial outperformance and underperformance compared to the market. Beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, generally hovers around 1.1-1.2, suggesting a slightly higher volatility than the S&P 500.  The recent increase in beta to 1.7 in 2022-2024 suggests increased sensitivity to market fluctuations.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 554.08 (Last Market: 554.25)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 575.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 576.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 559.40

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The relatively close proximity of the 60-day MA to the current price might indicate a potential support level.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (40.0):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.4):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day): -6.22:** Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.

The expected return of 4.66% is the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy.  This is a projection and actual results may vary.  The given market price of 554.25 doesn't show significant recent abrupt changes that would necessitate classifying it as a rapid upturn or downturn.  However, the combination of RSI, PPO and moving averages indicates cautious sentiment.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows a generally upward trend in both metrics, although growth rate appears to be slowing.  A direct comparison with analyst forecasts for the most recent quarter (Oct 31, 2024) is missing, preventing a complete assessment of performance relative to expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The provided financial data shows consistent high profit margins (around 81%) across the reported quarters.  Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates but generally remains above 8%, indicating effective use of shareholder equity.  However, without a comparison to industry benchmarks, it's difficult to definitively assess the strength of these figures.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

META shows a history of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but recent performance has been less impressive.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold market, however, the negative PPO and downward trending moving averages suggest some caution. While long-term growth potential remains (as indicated by the positive long-term expected return), careful consideration of current market sentiment and the potential for continued volatility is crucial.  Further analysis of recent news and analyst opinions is necessary for a complete assessment. The lack of comparison to analyst expectations and industry benchmarks limits the depth of this analysis.

**9.  Actionable Insights:**

* **Further Research:**  Thorough investigation of recent news articles, analyst reports (particularly concerning the October 31, 2024 earnings report), and comparison to industry benchmarks is crucial before making any investment decisions.
* **Risk Assessment:** Given the relatively high volatility (beta) and recent downward trend, investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance.
* **Long-Term Perspective:** The positive long-term expected return suggests that a long-term investment strategy may be suitable for those with a high risk tolerance and long-term investment horizon.
* **Diversification:**  Diversification within a portfolio is always recommended to mitigate risk.
