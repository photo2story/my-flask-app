This report analyzes META's performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and evaluating its financial health and future prospects.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

META has shown substantial long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, its performance is highly volatile, as indicated by both the Alpha/Beta analysis and the recent price movements.  While the current RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound from oversold conditions, the negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.  The strong financial data (revenue, profit margins) points to a healthy business, but the valuation relative to the market needs further examination given the high relative divergence. The expected long-term outperformance against the S&P 500 is promising, but the significant risk associated with its volatility should be carefully considered. Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data entry is necessary for a complete picture.  A thorough risk assessment considering the historical volatility is crucial before making any investment decisions.
