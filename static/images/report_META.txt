**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $501.48
* **5-day moving average:** $520.07
* **20-day moving average:** $558.67
* **60-day moving average:** $628.21

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent small price decrease (-$0.17) is not significant enough to be considered a sharp drop.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.97 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.578 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)

* **Expected Return:** -16.8% (Long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative, however the period over which this expectation is made is not defined.)

The indicators paint a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and relative divergence indicate bearish momentum. The negative expected return requires further context (timeframe).

**6) Overall Analysis:**

META has shown strong cumulative returns outperforming the S&P 500, with recent revenue and earnings growth.  However, significant volatility is evident in historical data, as indicated by the CAGR, MDD, and fluctuating Alpha and Beta.  Current technical indicators suggest a potential downward trend, despite the RSI approaching oversold levels.  The long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative (-16.8%), which needs further investigation into the timeframe and methodology used for this prediction.  Further analysis of the duplicate data point in the earnings report is recommended, as well as clarification on the methodology behind the -16.8% expected return. A cautious approach is advisable, considering the inherent risk associated with the stock's volatility and the need for further due diligence.
