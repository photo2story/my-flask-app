* **5-Day Moving Average:** $693.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $700.72

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has historically shown strong outperformance against the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by significant volatility.  Current indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the recent price drop and negative momentum warrant caution.  While earnings and revenue are growing, the consistency of profitability metrics needs closer examination due to some fluctuations and errors in the data.  The 1% expected excess return over the S&P 500, considering the volatility and risk, suggests a long-term investment strategy would be necessary for reasonable returns, but needs further diligence on the data provided.  Further investigation into the data inconsistencies is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  A thorough review of the company's fundamentals and future outlook is recommended before making any investment decisions.
