**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

META's cumulative return is 253.2%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 124.78%.  The difference is 128.42%, placing it in the 86.85th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's maximum and minimum divergence.  This indicates strong relative performance, although past performance is not indicative of future results. The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant variation across different periods, highlighting the volatility inherent in the stock.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $554.4 (Last Market: $554.95)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $570.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $575.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $559.85

The stock is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. However, it is slightly above its 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support. The last market price of $554.95 is close to the closing price, suggesting minimal immediate price fluctuations.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.59 – This suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.57 – This negative value confirms a bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -6.31 – A negative value signifies a recent short-term downtrend in relative performance against the S&P 500.

The combination of low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with negative relative divergence, points towards a bearish trend in the short term.  However, the oversold RSI could signal a potential short-term rebound.  Given the last market price ($554.95) is near the closing price, there's no indication of immediate dramatic price changes (sharp upturns or downturns). The expected return of 4.69% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 suggests potential outperformance in the long run.
