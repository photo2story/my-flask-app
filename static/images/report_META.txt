**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on connecting people through its family of apps and services, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.  META significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return exceeding VOO's by 51.95%.  The high relative divergence suggests this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show a fluctuating relationship between META's performance and the overall market.  While positive alpha values in several years indicate outperformance, the negative alpha in 2016-2018 and the large negative CAGR in 2020-2022 highlight periods of significant underperformance. The increasing beta values suggest increasing market sensitivity over time.  The very high CAGR (138%) and high alpha (2.2) in 2023-2025 show a strong rebound.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $504.73
* **Previous Close:** $531.62
* **Change:** -$5.06 (Significant daily drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $556.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $589.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $640.64

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The significant daily drop (-5.06) suggests a potential short-term downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)  - Suggests caution.
* **RSI:** 25.85 (Oversold) - Indicates the stock is potentially oversold and may be due for a bounce.
* **PPO:** -1.15 (Bearish) - Further confirms the bearish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -7.1% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return:** -11.2% - This is a short-term expectation. The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not explicitly provided but implied to be positive given the historical outperformance and the potential for a recovery from the oversold condition, though the high market risk should be considered.  The -11.2% expected return indicates a pessimistic short-term outlook.

The large price drop from the previous close reflects a significant negative event (not detailed in provided data), likely contributing to the negative expected return.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has shown a history of strong performance relative to the S&P 500, but recent performance is weaker.  While the current price shows a bearish trend and negative short-term expectations, several indicators suggest potential for a rebound.  The oversold RSI, combined with the potential for future growth indicated by revenue growth and generally high profit margins, makes long-term investment a possibility but carries significant risk given the high market risk indicator and negative short-term outlook.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and a more detailed analysis of the company's future prospects are crucial before making any investment decision.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data needs clarification.
