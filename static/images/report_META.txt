**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company that owns and operates social networking services, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

The cumulative return for META is 260.27%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 125.68%.  This represents a difference of 134.59%.  The relative divergence (89.27%) indicates META's performance is significantly higher than the S&P 500, placing it in the top 90th percentile of its historical performance relative to the benchmark.  However, this is relative and past performance doesn't guarantee future results.  The provided data shows considerable volatility in performance compared to the S&P 500, swinging from significantly outperforming to underperforming year over year.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

META shows strong long-term growth potential relative to the S&P 500, as evidenced by its high cumulative return compared to the benchmark.  However, short-term trends indicate some bearish pressure. The relatively high relative divergence suggests that META has outperformed the S&P 500 by a considerable margin, yet the consistency and sustainability of this performance must be considered given the year over year fluctuations.  Recent financial performance shows consistent growth in revenue and earnings, yet the assessment of whether this exceeds expectations requires further data.  Technical indicators point towards a somewhat bearish short-term sentiment, although RSI suggests the stock isn't severely oversold.  The analysis highlights the need for further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and comparisons to industry benchmarks to gain a more holistic perspective. A long-term, value-based investment approach is suggested in light of the long-term high projected return and strong profitability. However, the volatility requires careful consideration of risk.
