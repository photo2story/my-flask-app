The Alpha values show significant outperformance in certain years, while Beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying levels of market correlation.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in the final year(2023-2025) is noteworthy.  However, the data presents substantial volatility.


**2) Recent Price Movements:**

META's price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.  The recent price drop of -1.62 is a relatively small percentage decline.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (47.20):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (-0.85):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-9.0):** Indicates a recent downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (0.9%):**  A modest expected return of 0.9% above the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) suggests potential, but not exceptional, outperformance if the current trend continues.  This is a very rough estimate given the data limitations.  The negative recent price change is relatively small and doesn't warrant a "sharp decline" designation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent earnings are positive, showing growth in both revenue and EPS.  However, recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, and technical indicators present a mixed signal.  The high relative divergence against VOO suggests that the stock may be overvalued relative to its historical performance against the benchmark index. The provided expected return is a low estimate, but long-term investors should consider the historical volatility before making decisions.  Further investigation is needed to resolve the duplicate data point in the earnings data. A thorough risk assessment considering the high volatility is crucial before any investment decisions.
