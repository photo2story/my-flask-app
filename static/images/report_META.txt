Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on social networking and online advertising.

The cumulative return of META is 267.71%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 117.62%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 150.09%.  According to the provided data, this places META at the maximum observed historical divergence (150.1) from the S&P 500, representing a 100% position on the relative divergence scale.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $588.04

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates less volatility in the recent past.

Given the price of $630.20 and the positive recent relative divergence, no signs of a significant price jump or drop are directly apparent from these metrics.

META has shown exceptional historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, current indicators present a mixed picture.
