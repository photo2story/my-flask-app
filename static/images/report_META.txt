2025-04-23 - Analysis Report
## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Review

**Executive Summary:** Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on social networking and online advertising.  This report analyzes its recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO) and assessing its risk and potential return.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Meta's cumulative return of 93.56% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's 76.31% cumulative return, resulting in a 17.2% difference.  The relative divergence of 85.5% indicates Meta's performance is in the upper 85.5th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance over time.  While periods of strong outperformance (high Alpha) exist (2019-2021), there are also periods of significant underperformance (negative Alpha), notably 2020-2022. The Beta fluctuates, suggesting varying sensitivity to overall market movements. High maximum drawdown (MDD) values highlight periods of substantial risk. The recent high CAGR (123%) and the high MDD (109%) from 2023-2025 need further investigation for a better understanding.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 48.0% | 54.8% | 15.0% | 0.0 | 443.4 |
| 2016-2018  | -19.0% | 70.9% | -40.0% | -0.1 | 329.4 |
| 2017-2019  | 18.0% | 70.9% | -16.0% | 0.2 | 515.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 3.0% | 70.9% | 1.5 | 1.5 | 686.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 46.0% | 59.5% | 2.2 | 2.2 | 845.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

The closing price is $500.28.  The stock experienced a recent price increase ($3.22) compared to the previous close.  However, the price is below all three moving averages (5-day: $502.05, 20-day: $547.17, 60-day: $623.24), suggesting a potential downward trend.  This needs further investigation to understand whether it indicates continuation of this trend or a temporary dip.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 falls into the medium-risk category.
* **RSI:** 35.25 indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -0.6393 suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A positive change of 0.4 suggests a short-term upward trend, but this should be considered in the context of the moving average trends being downward.
* **Expected Return:** -16.8% indicates a negative expected return. This is a very negative prediction, and further analysis is needed to understand the basis of this prediction. A negative prediction, especially so strong, needs to be approached with caution and investigated further. It is contradicting the positive, though small, relative divergence.
* **Price Change:** The recent price increase of $3.22 is significant relative to the recent trend and may indicate a temporary bounce or a change in the trend.  Further analysis is needed to confirm whether this indicates a rebound or is just a temporary spike.

**Conclusion:**

While Meta's long-term cumulative return has outperformed the S&P 500, its recent performance and technical indicators suggest caution.  The high volatility, as evidenced by the MDD and the negative expected return, should be a concern.  The high relative divergence suggests potential future upswings. A long-term investment strategy needs a deep understanding of the factors impacting the negative expected return prediction and must account for the significant volatility.  Further research and monitoring are crucial before making any investment decisions.  Analyzing the reasons for such a high negative expected return, and why the current price does not reflect that prediction, is crucial for a reliable assessment.
