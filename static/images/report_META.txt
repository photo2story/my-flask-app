**0. Executive Summary:**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on social networking and online advertising.  The analysis below examines its recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), using various financial metrics and indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta's cumulative return (93.70%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (76.08%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 17.6%, placing it at the 85.7th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on provided max and min values.  However, the historical volatility, as indicated by the wide range of alpha and beta values and significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different periods, highlights considerable risk.

| 2023-2025  | 123.0% | 82.0% | 0.5 | 0.5 | 1272.7 |

The highly volatile alpha and beta values indicate significant periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  Market capitalization (Cap) shows substantial growth over the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $502.31
* **Previous Close:** $521.52
* **Change:** -$3.68 (a -0.7% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $529.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $562.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $630.23

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent decrease of -$3.68 warrants attention but doesn't signify a significant crash.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 32.90 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.48 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.8 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -16.8% (Negative, indicating potential underperformance relative to the market over the longer term, although this requires clarification of the calculation and underlying assumptions)


The indicators paint a mixed picture.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and negative expected return point towards caution. The negative price change further supports this caution.

| 2024-10-31 | 4.5   | $34.15 Billion   | *(Note: Duplicate entry. Possible data error)*

Earnings show a generally upward trend in both EPS and revenue, although there appears to be a data duplication issue for October 31st.  Further investigation into data accuracy is needed.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Meta has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by substantial volatility. Recent price action shows a downward trend, supported by negative momentum indicators (PPO).  While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the negative expected return and the currently bearish trend call for caution.  Further investigation into data inconsistencies, a deeper dive into the -16.8% expected return calculation, and consideration of the company's long-term growth prospects are crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.  The strong revenue and profitability figures provide a positive counterpoint to the near-term negative price movement and indicators, suggesting a potential long-term investment opportunity but only after further due diligence.  The high historical Maximum Drawdowns also serve as a significant warning about potential future risks.
