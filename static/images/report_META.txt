## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company that owns and operates social networking services, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

The cumulative return of META is 258.12%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference is 141.7%, placing it at the 96.5th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the benchmark over the period considered.  However, the provided data doesn't specify the time frame for this analysis; understanding the timeframe is critical to interpret the significance of this outperformance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values. While alpha is consistently positive (indicating outperformance), beta is high, signifying significant sensitivity to market movements. The high beta is consistent with the volatility reflected in MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values.  The periods of negative returns (e.g., 2016-2018, 2020-2022) underscore the risk associated with this investment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $613.74
* **Last Market Price:** $613.93
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $609.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $604.847
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $591.3867

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the moving averages indicates a relatively stable price action in the recent period.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 52.15.  This indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, suggesting neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0318.  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum, although it is quite close to zero.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 0.3 (+). This suggests a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -0.2%.  This signifies that, despite the recent strong performance relative to the S&P 500, the long-term (2+ years) expected return is slightly negative compared to the S&P 500. This could reflect market expectations for future growth. The discrepancy between short-term and long-term expectations is worth further investigation.
* **Price Impact:** The provided Last-market price (613.93) doesn't significantly differ from the closing price and moving averages, so no significant price jumps or drops are detected.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

META demonstrates strong short-term performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the long-term outlook is more cautious, with a slightly negative expected return relative to the index.  The company exhibits robust revenue and profit growth, and strong financial health.  Despite the positive indicators, the high beta underscores the volatility inherent in this investment. The high MDD values highlight the risk of significant drawdowns.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high returns against the substantial risk before making any investment decisions. Further analysis of the duplicate entry in the earnings data and investigation into the reasons behind the long-term negative expected return are recommended.  A more comprehensive analysis, incorporating factors like industry trends, competition, and macroeconomic conditions, would provide a more complete picture.
