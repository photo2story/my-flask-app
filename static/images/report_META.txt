*   **Company Overview:** Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology conglomerate focused on social media, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.

*   **Cumulative Return:**
    *   META: 123.61%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO): 99.09%

*   **Divergence:**

    *   **Insider Activity:** The news of Robert Kimmitt selling shares might be a small concern, but more context (e.g., reason for sale, size of position) is needed.

*   **Impact:** The news flow is likely contributing to positive investor sentiment and the recent upward price movement.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (Mean = 1.36)
*   **Target Price:**
    *   Average: 837.92

*   **Analysis:** Overwhelmingly positive analyst sentiment.  The average target price suggests significant upside potential from the current price.  The range of target prices indicates some disagreement among analysts but still mostly positive. The lack of detail on recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the trend in analyst opinion.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-10-30 | 1.08 | 51.24 B$ |
| 2025-07-31 | 7.28 | 47.52 B$ |
| 2025-05-01 | 6.59 | 42.31 B$ |
| 2024-10-31 | 6.20 | 40.59 B$ |
| 2025-10-30 | 6.20 | 40.59 B$ |

*   **Trend:**  Revenue has generally been increasing, but the most recent EPS is very low compared to the previous quarters. It is likely that 2024-10-31 should be 2024-10-31 or 2026-10-30.
*   **Analysis:** The recent dip in EPS is a concern and would warrant further investigation. Was this a one-time event or does it reflect a change in the fundamentals of the business? The growth in revenue, prior to most recent earnings, is a positive sign.
