### 7. Overall Analysis & Conclusion

META has shown strong recent performance, outperforming the S&P 500 and demonstrating robust revenue and profit growth.

The oversold RSI might present a short-term buying opportunity, but a comprehensive risk assessment is crucial before making investment decisions. Keep a close watch on company news and analyst opinions, given the dynamic market conditions.
