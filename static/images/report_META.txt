## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company that owns and operates social networking services, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

The cumulative return for META is 254.97%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 112.47%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 142.5%, placing it at the 96.9th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided data. This indicates strong outperformance relative to the broader market over the analyzed period.  The provided alpha consistently shows a positive value (although small at 0.1), further suggesting outperformance. However,  it's crucial to consider that past performance is not indicative of future results. The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values in some periods highlight significant risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $608.33
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $616.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $607.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $589.78

The price is currently slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend. However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential longer-term uptrend.  The relatively close proximity to the 20-day average suggests relatively little momentum in either direction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.84 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.02 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -0.3% (This suggests a slightly negative expected return in the near term).  Note that this is a prediction, and actual returns may vary significantly.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is implied to be positive, given the past outperformance. This assumes that the high past growth rate is sustainable.

**Important Note on the $608.33 price:** The provided data doesn't suggest a dramatic recent price swing (either up or down) that would require special analysis.  The slight difference between the closing price and the moving averages aligns with the observation above.

The relatively low PPO value and the negative near-term expected return suggest caution. The provided data inconsistencies require further verification before drawing definitive conclusions.  A long-term investment strategy might be considered, but only after a thorough due diligence process considering the risk factors.  Investors should not solely rely on past performance.
