## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Investment Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company that develops and sells social networking services and advertising products.

The cumulative return of META is 265.87%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 121.78%.  The difference is 144.1%, placing it at the 98th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a strong outperformance over the period considered.  The provided CAGR data shows considerable volatility, with periods of both significant gains and losses.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $624.24
* **Last Market Price:** $619.98
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $625.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $593.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $583.09

The stock price is currently slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting recent minor downward pressure. However, it sits comfortably above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price is minimal and does not signal a significant immediate price movement (no sharp increase or decrease).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 74.12  (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.52 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** 0.0 (-) (Slight short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 56.6% above S&P 500

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term, potentially leading to a correction. However, the positive PPO confirms upward momentum. The expected return is quite optimistic, suggesting significant outperformance against the market index over the long term, but this should be considered cautiously given the market's inherent volatility.  The negative change in relative strength suggests some short-term weakness.
