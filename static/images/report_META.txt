## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Review

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on connecting people through its family of apps and services.

The cumulative return for META is 259.71%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.36%.  The difference is 139.4 percentage points, placing it at the 95.6th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided maximum and minimum differences).  The provided alpha and beta values suggest periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market, highlighting the volatility inherent in META's stock.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in several periods (particularly 2019-2021 and 2023-2025) is offset by significant negative returns in other periods (notably 2020-2022), indicating considerable risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $616.46
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $610.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $605.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $592.56

The stock price is currently trading above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.  The recent price increase, reflected in the `Last-market` data,  indicates a slight uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.99 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.0064 (Positive, indicating a bullish momentum, although very weak)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -1.3% (Slight negative short-term divergence)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -0.1% (This suggests a slightly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, though this is a very small negative value and may not be significant).  The small positive change in closing price compared to the previous close should be noted, but the context of this and the other factors must be carefully considered.  Sudden large price movements can quickly impact this.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a clear upward trend in both EPS and revenue.  However, there's a discrepancy in the October 2024 data. The EPS and Revenue figures reported twice at the same levels (1st of August and 31st of October) seem duplicated.  The provided data needs to be clarified to allow for a meaningful analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Both revenue and profit margin have remained relatively stable and high over the reported period. This is indicative of financial strength.  Equity is showing consistent growth, and while ROE fluctuates, it mostly remains above 8%, suggesting profitable use of shareholder equity.  The most recent figures are better than the preceding two quarters, suggesting improvement.  Again, a close review of the data's integrity is necessary.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has shown significant long-term growth potential, vastly outperforming the S&P 500 in the past. However, this performance has been highly volatile, with periods of substantial losses.  While recent earnings and financial data appear strong (pending clarification of the duplicate entries), the -0.1% expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests a lower long-term return than the market.  Technical indicators show a slightly positive but weak momentum.  Investors should carefully consider the high volatility inherent in META's stock and balance the potential for substantial returns against the risk of significant losses.  The accuracy of data presented (regarding duplicates) would heavily impact this conclusion.
