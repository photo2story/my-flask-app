**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the long-term based on the provided cumulative return data. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend, with high risk indicated by the MRI.  The strong financial fundamentals (growing revenue, high profit margins, increasing equity, and improving ROE) support a bullish long-term outlook.  The lack of a provided long-term expected return relative to VOO and the data inconsistencies (duplicate entry) limit the conclusion.  Further analysis incorporating a complete long-term expected return and clarifying the data issues is necessary for a more robust investment recommendation.  Currently, the information points towards a potentially risky but potentially rewarding long-term investment opportunity depending on the risk tolerance of the investor and if the long-term alpha is higher than the Beta's risk.
