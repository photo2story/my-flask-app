## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Review

**0) Overview:** Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on connecting people and building communities through its family of apps and services.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Meta Platforms (META) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for META is 93.64%, while the VOO's cumulative return is 76.18%.  This represents a difference of 17.5%, placing META at the 85.7th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a historical range of -111.7% to 39.1%).  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a volatile relationship between META's performance and the market (Beta).  While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates significantly from year to year, the high Alpha values in some periods (particularly 2019-2021) indicate periods of outperformance relative to the market.  Conversely, negative Alpha values suggest underperformance.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) in some years highlights the significant risk associated with investing in META.  The market capitalization (Cap) has generally increased over time.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is $501.48, slightly down from the previous close of $502.31 (-$0.17).  The stock price is below its 5-day ($520.07), 20-day ($558.67), and 60-day ($628.21) moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk).  This suggests a moderate level of risk associated with the stock.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 35.97. This indicates the stock is in oversold territory (below 30 often signifies oversold conditions), suggesting potential for a price rebound, but it's not a guarantee.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.578.  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:**  The recent 20-day relative divergence of -0.8 confirms the short-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return:** -16.8%. This suggests a negative return is expected in the short term. The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not explicitly stated but implied to be positive given the higher cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500 in previous years. The current price movement (-$0.17) doesn't suggest any drastic changes.

**6) Summary:**

META has historically shown strong growth and outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by significant volatility and risk.  While recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, the strong financial performance and indicators like the relatively low RSI suggest potential for a rebound. However, the negative expected return and medium risk rating indicate caution is warranted.  The duplicated earnings data requires clarification. Further analysis considering macroeconomic factors and company-specific news is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Long-term investors might find the potential for outperformance against the S&P 500 attractive despite the inherent risk.
