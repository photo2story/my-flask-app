**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $689.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $677.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $631.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $604.15

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The price is relatively close to its 5-day MA, and further above its 20 and 60-day MAs indicating that the recent price increases may be somewhat less sustainable.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 78.60 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a correction)
* **PPO:** 1.13 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.2%  This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  The extremely high RSI suggests this may be an optimistic outlook.


The recent price change of $0.32 (0.05%) from the previous close is relatively minor and doesn't indicate a significant sudden upward or downward movement (no "sharp increase" or "sharp decrease").

**6) Overall Analysis:**

META has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered, with strong revenue and profit growth.  However, the high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, increasing the risk of a short-term correction. The positive PPO indicates continued upward momentum, but this should be viewed cautiously given the overbought RSI. Long-term prospects appear positive based on financial statements and consistent growth, but the current high valuation warrants careful consideration of risk. The provided 0.2% expected excess return over the long term is likely optimistic given the current valuation and potential for a correction.  Further analysis, including consideration of industry trends and competitive landscape, is recommended for a more comprehensive assessment.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) need to be resolved for a more accurate analysis.
