2025-01-21 - Analysis Report
## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on social networking and related services.

The cumulative return of META is 257.56%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference is 139.2%, placing it at the 95.5th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  This indicates strong outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance over the years. While some periods show extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and positive alpha (outperformance relative to the benchmark), other periods reveal substantial losses and negative alpha.  The beta (volatility relative to the market) fluctuates, highlighting periods of both high and low market sensitivity.  The consistently high cap (market capitalization) indicates the company's significant size in the market.  Note that the alpha values of 0.1 across all periods appear unusually consistent and may need further investigation for accuracy.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $612.77
* **5-day Moving Average:** $608.75
* **20-day Moving Average:** $604.39
* **60-day Moving Average:** $591.98

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-to-medium-term trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates a consolidating, albeit upward-trending, market.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 53.39 – Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, indicating a relatively neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.0394 – Slightly negative, suggesting a weak momentum in the market.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -3.3% –  Indicates a recent minor downward shift in relative strength.
* **Price Change:** The recent price increase of $0.24 (0.04%) suggests a slight upward movement, not significant enough to be considered a sudden jump.
* **Expected Return:** -0.1% – This suggests a slightly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This may be at odds with the strong historical outperformance; further investigation into the calculation and underlying assumptions is warranted.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a consistent upward trend in both EPS (Earnings Per Share) and revenue.  However, there is a duplicate entry for October 31st, 2024.  Clarification is needed on this data point.  The steady growth suggests a healthy financial performance.


| Date         | EPS | Revenue      |
|--------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-10-31   | 6.2 | $40.59B       |

| **2024-10-31** | **4.5** | **$34.15B** |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability sections show mostly consistent growth in revenue and high and stable profit margins, indicating strong financial health.  Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) have also largely increased across the quarters, displaying positive growth trajectory. The slight dip in Q2 2024 for ROE may warrant further investigation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, significantly outpacing it over the period analyzed.  However, this performance has been volatile, with periods of substantial gains and losses.  Current technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook.  The long-term expected return, as provided, is unexpectedly negative,  contradicting the historical outperformance and requiring further investigation.  Fundamental analysis shows strong revenue and profit growth, along with increasing equity and ROE.  The duplicate data point in earnings and the unexpectedly negative long-term expected return require clarification and deeper analysis before making any investment decisions.  Further research into the company's future prospects and the methodology behind the expected return calculation is essential.
