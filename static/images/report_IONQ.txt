    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown values are very high, indicating significant volatility.
    *   **Alpha:**  The consistently high Alpha values indicate IONQ is outperforming its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values are near 0, suggesting IONQ's price movements are not strongly correlated with the broader market. In other words, it's moving independently of the S&P 500.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization seems to show a significant and rapid growth.

**In simple terms:** IONQ has delivered much higher returns than the S&P 500, but with substantial volatility. Its performance is largely independent of the overall market.

    *   20-day SMA: 50.01
    *   60-day SMA: 56.47

**In simple terms:** IONQ's price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a recent downtrend. The price decrease in the last market is significant.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Hybrid Signal Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended): This suggests that, based on the model used for MRI, IONQ is considered a relatively good investment opportunity.
*   **RSI:** 40.49: The RSI is below 50, suggesting that the stock may be losing momentum.
*   **PPO:** 0.1962: This positive PPO value suggests that the 12-day moving average is above the 26-day moving average, which can be considered a bullish signal. However, the small value indicates weak momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (21 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)": This suggests a strong buy signal, allocating all available cash to the stock.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -3.6 (-): 단기하락(short-term decline): This indicates a recent decrease in the stock's performance relative to its comparison, signaling a short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** 42.3%: Projected to outperform the S&P 500 significantly over a 2+ year investment horizon.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

IONQ presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Exceptional long-term growth potential in the quantum computing sector.
    *   Significantly outperforming the S&P 500 historically (but with high volatility).
    *   Strong analyst consensus (Buy rating).
    *   Increasing revenue (though still low).
    *   High Profit Margins
    *   Large Equity raises
*   **Weaknesses/Risks:**
    *   Consistently unprofitable with widening losses (negative EPS and ROE).
    *   High volatility and Maximum Drawdown.
    *   Recent price decline and negative short-term divergence.
    *   Valuation concerns highlighted in recent news.
    *   Technology is still nascent and quantum computing market is uncertain.
    *   Beta is near 0, so this stock is independent from the S&P 500

**Overall Recommendation:**

IONQ may be suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon who are optimistic about the future of quantum computing. However, given the current financial performance, recent price weakness, and volatility, investors should be cautious and conduct thorough due diligence before investing. The significant equity increases suggest dilution should be a concern for existing shareholders. The MRI, PPO and RSI do not give positive signals.
