**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

IONQ Inc. is a company focused on developing and commercializing trapped-ion quantum computers.  Compared to the S&P 500 (represented by VOO), IONQ has significantly outperformed the market, with a cumulative return vastly exceeding that of the benchmark index. The substantial return difference (155.8%) and high relative divergence highlight IONQ's strong performance, although this is relative to its own historical volatility against the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD (%) | Alpha | Beta | Cap (B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| 2021-2023  | 178.0%   | 80.0%   | 149.0% | 0.0   | 3.0     |
| 2022-2024  | 218.0%   | 77.2%   | 203.0% | 0.0   | 10.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 111.0%   | 75.1%   | 108.0% | 0.2   | 4.9     |


The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) demonstrates significant growth over the periods analyzed.  However, the substantial MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates considerable risk.  The near-zero beta initially suggests low correlation with the market, but later analysis shows a slight increase, indicating growing market sensitivity.  The abnormally high Alpha values may suggest that this performance is significantly outpacing what would be expected from the risk taken, but this could also be indicative of the use of an inappropriate model for Alpha/Beta calculation due to the unique characteristics of such a new technology company.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $20.68
* **Previous Close:** $23.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $22.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $22.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $30.74

The price has experienced a recent decline, trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short term. The significant daily drop of -11.05% indicates a sharp negative price movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.6333 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.07 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so.)
* **PPO:** 1.13 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 77.1% (Significant excess return compared to the S&P 500)

The high MRI indicates elevated risk, while the RSI suggests the stock might be approaching oversold conditions. The positive PPO offers some counterpoint.  The recent negative price movement needs careful consideration, but the high expected return highlights the potential for substantial long-term growth, if the risks are manageable.  The large negative daily price change of -11.05% suggests a significant event may have impacted the price.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |

| 2024-11-06 | -$0.22 | $0.01B      |

IONQ is currently operating at a loss, consistent across the reported quarters.  Revenue remains relatively flat.  This needs to be considered against the high growth expectations and valuation.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B      | 56.92%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B      | 47.46%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity      | ROE (%)       |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B      | -52.62%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B      | -12.05%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B      | -8.11%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B      | -8.25%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.48B      | -8.64%        |

While profit margins show some variability, they are generally positive. However, the negative ROE across all reported quarters indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity investment.  The substantial drop in equity in Q4 2024 warrants further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ has demonstrated impressive growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over various periods.  However, this performance is coupled with high risk, as evidenced by significant drawdowns and a high MRI.  The company is currently unprofitable, and recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  While the long-term outlook based on expected returns is positive, investors must carefully consider the current losses, substantial risk, and the relatively recent nature of this nascent industry.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The sudden drop in equity and price needs further investigation to identify the underlying cause.
