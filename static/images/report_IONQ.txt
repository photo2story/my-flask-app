**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

IONQ has demonstrated extraordinary growth potential and significant outperformance against the S&P 500. The high Alpha and CAGR figures reflect this. However, the stock also carries substantial risk, as evidenced by the high MDD and recent volatility.

Financially, IONQ is still in a growth phase, characterized by negative EPS and ROE, but with positive profit margins. This suggests potential for future profitability as revenue scales. Recent news suggests that there are major developments occurring, adding to the volatility.

The hybrid signal's cautious stance, combined with the low MRI, suggests a balanced approach to the stock. The expected return of 24% (over the S&P 500) makes IONQ an attractive long-term investment, but the stock's volatility and current financial metrics require careful monitoring and a high risk tolerance.
