*   **Risk Factors:** The high MDD, negative earnings, and recent news suggesting volatility need consideration.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The current price action suggests upward momentum, but the RSI indicates it might be nearing overbought conditions.
*   **Financial Health:** Improving financials are a positive sign, but sustained progress toward profitability is crucial.
