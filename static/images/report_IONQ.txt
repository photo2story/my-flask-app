## IONQ Inc. Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

IONQ Inc. is a company that develops and commercializes trapped-ion quantum computers.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but with considerable volatility.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 153.49%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 6.48%
* **Return Difference:** 147.01%  (IONQ significantly outperformed VOO)
* **Relative Divergence:** 55.8% (This indicates IONQ's performance is in the upper portion of its historical relative performance range compared to VOO).

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The alpha and beta values show high volatility and significant market sensitivity (high beta).  While alpha is generally positive, indicating outperformance, the high beta suggests a substantial portion of the return is correlated with the overall market movement. The high beta also implies increased risk.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0% | 72.8% | 73.0% | 0.2 | 2.9 |

The recent price drop of $2.37 indicates a significant negative movement, likely contributing to the High Risk MRI.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company consistently reports negative EPS and relatively flat revenue.  This is expected in a high-growth, early-stage technology company like IONQ, as they prioritize investments in R&D over short-term profitability.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24  | $0.01B       |
| 2024-08-07 | -0.18  | $0.01B       |
| 2024-05-10 | -0.19  | $0.01B       |
| 2023-11-09 | -0.22  | $0.01B       |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.22  | $0.01B       |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, but profit margins fluctuate.  Crucially, Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not yet generating sufficient returns on its invested capital.  This is a key area to monitor for future investment decisions.


Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B | 56.92% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B | 47.46% |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

IONQ has shown impressive returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility and risk. The negative ROE and consistently negative EPS raise concerns about long-term financial sustainability. While the high growth potential of the quantum computing sector is attractive, investors should carefully consider the high risk profile, evidenced by the negative ROE, high beta, and volatile price action.  Further analysis of the company's future R&D roadmap, potential partnerships, and market penetration strategy is crucial before making investment decisions.  The high expected return should be viewed with caution, given the inherent risks associated with this high-growth, early-stage company.
