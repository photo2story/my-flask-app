### 7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)

IONQ has shown remarkable historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, characterized by high growth and volatility. The alpha analysis confirms the stock's ability to outperform the market independent of overall market movements. However, recent indicators present a mixed picture. The price is trading below its short-term moving averages, and the hybrid signal suggests caution. Despite these cautionary signals, the recent price increase and long-term expected return of 26.4% are optimistic signs.

Financially, IONQ is still in the early stages of commercialization, as shown by the consistent negative EPS and ROE figures. The company's revenue remains small at $0.01 billion. The latest quarterly ROE, while still negative, shows a substantial improvement, and the significant jump in equity suggests potential strategic moves or funding.

Recent news indicates significant business and market activity. Investors should closely monitor these developments to understand the factors driving the stock's volatility and to assess potential risks and opportunities.

**In summary, IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock with significant potential, but also considerable uncertainty. Investors should proceed with caution, closely monitor company news and financial performance, and consider their risk tolerance.**
