The company is currently unprofitable, but has positive profit margins, which is a good sign. While the recent price drop and news warrants caution, the MRI and Hybrid signal suggest a buy.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Volatility:** Expect continued price swings.
*   **Profitability:** Focus on the company's path to profitability.
*   **News and Events:** Closely monitor news and company announcements.

**Recommendation:**

Given the potential for long-term outperformance (19.5% expected return) and the current buy signal, a speculative buy may be warranted. However, investors should be prepared for significant volatility and closely monitor the company's progress towards profitability and any major news or events. It's critical to understand the risks associated with investing in a company in a nascent industry like quantum computing.
