*   **IONQ Inc. Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.
*   **Cumulative Return:**
    *   IONQ: 275.02%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO): 48.45%
*   **Divergence:** Current divergence is 249.0, with a relative divergence of 66.0. This indicates IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, and its current outperformance sits in the upper-middle range of its historical divergence.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis Table:**

    | Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
    |------------|---------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
    | 2021-2023  | 84.0%   | 82.3%  | 83.0%    | -0.0   | 4.4    |

    *   **CAGR:** Shows very high compounded annual growth rates. This suggests rapid growth in the stock's value over the evaluated periods.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown indicates significant volatility, meaning potential for substantial losses from peak to trough.
    *   **Alpha:** High positive Alpha values suggest IONQ's performance significantly exceeded what would be expected based on market movements alone.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is near zero, suggesting IONQ's price movement is almost uncorrelated with the market.  This could be because quantum computing is a new and distinct sector.
    *   **Cap(B):** Cap (B) is increasing, indicating IONQ's growth as a company.

**Simple Analysis:** IONQ has delivered substantial returns compared to the S&P 500. Its near-zero Beta suggests it moves independently of the broader market. However, the high MDD signals considerable risk. High positive Alpha is positive for IONQ's performance.
