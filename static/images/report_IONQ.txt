2025-11-15 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's an analysis of IONQ (IONQ Inc.), incorporating the provided data, in English, with a focus on key metrics and insights.

**Report: IONQ (IONQ Inc.) Stock Analysis**

IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Cumulative Return:** IONQ: 297.73%, VOO: 46.48%
*   **Relative Divergence:** Current: 296.1, Relative: 69.0 (Range: Min -28.8, Max 441.9)

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). The large relative divergence (69.0) indicates that IONQ's performance is high compared to its historical range relative to the index. However, the 'relative' aspect means it's positioned in the higher percentiles of *past* relative performance, not a guaranteed future indicator.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%   | 82.3%  | 83.0%   | -0.0   | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0%  | 82.3%  | 188.0%  | -0.0   | 14.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 304.0%  | 79.6%  | 241.0%  | 0.0  | 16.7   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Very high growth rates, increasing over the periods analyzed, which reflects the speculative aspect of quantum computing stocks.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Substantial drawdowns indicate high volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Extremely high alpha values suggest significant outperformance relative to market benchmarks (risk-adjusted). However, the consistency of these values needs to be considered in relation to the Beta.
*   **Beta:** Beta is near zero, suggesting IONQ's price movement is largely independent of the broader market (S&P 500).  This further emphasizes that IONQ's performance is driven by company-specific factors and sector sentiment rather than overall market trends.
*   **Cap:** The market capitalization grows significantly over the periods.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $47.18
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 47.18, 'previousClose': 45.4, 'change': 3.92}
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 50.616
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 56.761
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 58.9083

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, the recent price increase (change of 3.92 from previous close) may signal a potential reversal or at least a pause in the decline. It's important to note the price experienced 급반등(sharp rebound) or 급하락(sharp decline)

**3. Technical Indicators & Outlook**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 31.97 (Oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -2.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell 80.0% of holdings (3082 shares - Risky - MRI:0.50) (Cash Ratio: 80% on 2025-10-16)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.4 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 34.2% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI indicates the stock may be oversold and potentially due for a bounce.
*   The negative PPO confirms the downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends a high cash position and selling a significant portion of holdings, indicating caution.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days suggests recent underperformance.
*   The Expected Return of 34.2% suggests analysts believe IONQ will outperform the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) through dollar-cost averaging/consistent investment. However, this is a projection and not a guarantee.
*   The recent price increase (change of 3.92 from previous close) could be a positive sign, but needs to be monitored.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

| 2024-09-30   | $0.01B   | 47.46%        |

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $2.27B    | -46.41%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.16B    | -15.22%   |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.77B    | -4.22%    |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.44B    | -12.05%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** Revenue is growing, and profit margins are relatively high, suggesting good pricing power. However, the revenue scale is still small.
*   **Equity & ROE:** Equity has increased significantly, likely due to fundraising activities. ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, reflecting the company's current unprofitability. The high equity is important for quantum computing as it requires continuous investments and R&D.

**7. Overall Analysis & Recommendation**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock. Its performance has been exceptional compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with significant volatility, as reflected in the MDD. Recent news highlights both the potential and the risks.

*   **Strengths:** High growth potential in the quantum computing sector, strong analyst ratings, positive long-term return expectations, increasing revenue, good profit margins, and a healthy balance sheet after recent capital injections. The high alpha suggests outperformance when considering risk.
*   **Weaknesses:** Current unprofitability, high volatility, recent stock price decline, and concerning recent EPS, dependence on continued funding and technological advancement. The negative ROE and recent price drop are red flags.
*   **Hybrid signal is Cash_80%_Sell 80.0% of holdings**

**Recommendation:**

Given the recent price decline and the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. While the long-term potential remains, the short-term risks are elevated.

*   **For existing holders:** Consider reducing your position, especially if you are risk-averse, in line with the Hybrid Signal.
*   **For potential investors:** A small speculative position might be considered, but only with capital you are willing to lose. Thoroughly understand the risks associated with investing in a pre-profitability, highly speculative sector. Keep a close eye on earnings reports, technological developments, and overall market sentiment towards quantum computing.
