## IONQ Inc. (IONQ) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

IONQ Inc. is a company developing trapped-ion quantum computers.  The following analysis summarizes key performance indicators and recent trends.


**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 198.60%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 15.24%
* **Return Difference:** 183.4%  (This represents a significant outperformance of IONQ compared to the S&P 500. However, it's crucial to consider the high volatility indicated by the relative divergence range (-36.2% to 289.4%). The current position at 67.4% on the relative divergence scale implies that while significantly outperforming the S&P 500,  it is not at its historical peak performance relative to the index. More context on the timeframe is needed for a complete interpretation)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0% | 72.8% | 71.0% | 0.1 | 3.0 |

* **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows extremely high growth over the periods, indicating significant potential but also high risk.
* **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates substantial volatility.  The high MDD values alongside the high CAGR highlight the considerable risk associated with IONQ.
* **Alpha:**  High positive alpha values suggest outperformance relative to the market benchmark (though this needs careful consideration with the small market capitalization),  but again, high risk and volatility should be considered.
* **Beta:** Shows varying sensitivity to market movements. The high Beta values show that the stock is highly volatile.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $25.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $24.2685
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $28.2775

The price is currently below the 60-day moving average but above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bullish trend, although it's not conclusive.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk) â€“ This suggests moderate risk associated with the stock.

The recent 4.85% price jump suggests a possible short-term upward trend, but further observation is needed to confirm.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24  | $0.01B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -0.18  | $0.01B      |
| 2024-05-10 | -0.19  | $0.01B      |
| 2023-11-09 | -0.22  | $0.01B      |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.22  | $0.01B      |


Consistent negative EPS indicates the company is currently not profitable. Revenue remains consistently low.  This warrants caution.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B | 56.92%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B | 47.46%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.01B | 50.59%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.01B | 54.97%      |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.01B | 48.20%      |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE       |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B | -52.62%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B | -12.05%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B | -8.11%    |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B | -8.25%    |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.48B | -8.64%    |

High profit margins despite low revenue are intriguing and require further investigation into the accounting practices. However, significantly negative ROE consistently points towards substantial losses relative to shareholder equity.  This is a critical concern.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

IONQ shows impressive cumulative returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this is coupled with extreme volatility and consistently negative EPS.  The high CAGR and significant MDD values highlight the substantial risk involved. While the positive expected return and technical indicators suggest potential upward momentum,  the negative ROE and consistently low revenue raise significant concerns about the company's long-term financial health and sustainability.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution, carefully considering the high risk associated with this high-growth, pre-profit company.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
