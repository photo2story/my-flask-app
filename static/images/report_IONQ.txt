**Report on IONQ Inc.**

**Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Cumulative Return (IONQ):** 323.20%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 51.08%
*   **Absolute Spread:** 271.9
*   **Range (Min/Max Spread):** -28.8 / 391.8
*   **Relative Spread:** 71.5

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The relative spread of 71.5 indicates that its current outperformance is positioned in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%   | 82.3% | 83.0%   | -0.0  | 4.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0%  | 82.3% | 188.0%  | -0.0  | 14.5   |
| 2023-2025  | 330.0%  | 79.5% | 262.0%  | 0.0   | 21.8   |

**Analysis:**
*   The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) demonstrates substantial growth over each period.
*   MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, which is considerable.
*   Alpha is high, implying significant outperformance relative to the market.
*   Beta is approximately zero, suggesting very low correlation with the market (S&P 500). This is somewhat surprising, as one would expect *some* market correlation.
*   Cap(B) is increasing

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Last Price:** $62.79
*   **Previous Close:** $60.30
*   **Change:** 4.13%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** $59.49
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $68.32
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $55.39

**Analysis:** The recent price increase of 4.13% is significant. The stock price is above its 5-day and 60-day moving averages but below its 20-day moving average.  This suggests a potential short-term bullish trend, but caution is warranted as it's below the 20-day MA.

**3. Indicators and Signals**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 36.40
*   **PPO:** -3.33
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_80%_Sell (80% of holdings - Risky - MRI: 0.5)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -21.5 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 31.2% (vs. S&P 500, long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a generally positive investment outlook.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 40, indicating that the stock may be approaching oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Cash_80%_Sell" signal is concerning.  This signifies a signal suggesting to reduce holdings significantly, and the "Risky" tag and lower MRI (0.5) with this signal should be noted. It contrasts with the general MRI, adding uncertainty.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** The negative divergence confirms the recent short-term price weakening.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return indicates significant potential upside relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, which is very positive if the investor can tolerate volatility. The price change from the previous close (4.13%) suggests some volatility or reaction to recent news.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Motley Fool Articles (Oct 27, 2025):** The headlines present a mixed picture. Some articles are bullish ("1 Tech Stock to Buy," "Think It's Too Late to Buy?"), while others are more cautious ("What's the Best Quantum Computing Stock? It Just Became Crystal Clear (Hint: It's Not IonQ)"). There's also speculation about a stock split and the potential impact of political events. A price prediction for 2035 also exists.

**Analysis:** The news sentiment is mixed. While there's some positive coverage, the presence of articles questioning IONQ's leadership in quantum computing and suggesting alternatives is a cause for concern.  The stock split speculation is also important to note. Investors should read these articles for context.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.62 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 8
*   **Target Price (Avg/High/Low):** $64.62 / $100.00 / $32.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  (No Changes Listed)

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is generally positive with a "Buy" rating. The average target price suggests modest upside from the current price. The wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty among analysts.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue remains low but the Profit Margin is relatively high.
*   **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has increased significantly, suggesting successful capital raising.  However, ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, reflecting the company's unprofitability despite the increased equity.

**7. Overall Analysis**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock.

*   **Positives:** Significant historical outperformance vs. S&P 500, high Alpha, and a potentially oversold RSI. Analyst consensus is "Buy," and the company has substantial equity. The MRI is positive. The long-term expected return vs. the S&P 500 is significant.
*   **Negatives:** Unprofitable with negative EPS and ROE. The "Cash_80%_Sell" hybrid signal is a strong warning. MDD are relatively high.  Recent news sentiment is mixed, and the Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence indicates recent short-term decline. While Profit Margin is high, revenue is still very low.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. While the long-term potential and strong past performance are attractive, the current unprofitability, the "Cash_80%_Sell" signal, and the mixed news headlines raise concerns.

*   **For aggressive investors with a high-risk tolerance:**  A small, speculative position may be considered, but careful monitoring is essential.
*   **For most investors:**  It's prudent to wait for signs of improved profitability and a more consistent positive outlook before investing. Pay close attention to upcoming earnings reports and any news regarding the "Cash_80%_Sell" signal. A deeper dive into the underlying reasons for the signal would be prudent.
