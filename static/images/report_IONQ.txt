* **20-Day Moving Average:** $23.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $30.13

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 49.93 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 2.76 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +16.3% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 26.1% (This is likely an estimate of the potential overall long-term return, not necessarily a return for the coming year).

The relatively high MRI value suggests a high-risk investment, although the RSI indicates a neutral position.  The positive PPO confirms short-term bullish momentum.  The recent price increase of $0.77 can be considered a minor upward movement, not a significant jump. The substantial expected return needs to be considered within the context of significant risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ has demonstrated significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this comes with considerable risk as highlighted by its high Beta and fluctuating Alpha values.  The company is currently unprofitable, with negative ROE. While recent price action shows a slight upward trend, the stock is trading below its moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The high MRI value suggests high risk.  Long-term investment requires careful consideration of the high risk-reward profile.  Further due diligence including a deep dive into the company's fundamentals, business model, and future prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided financial data is limited and should be expanded upon before a comprehensive assessment can be made.  The repeated data entry in the earnings report requires clarification.
