**Report on IONQ Inc.**

**0. Executive Summary**

IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.  The stock has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but recent market data suggests a potential short-term pullback. Analyst sentiment remains positive, but negative earnings and negative ROE should be considered.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Cumulative Return (IONQ):** 311.59%

*   **Relative Divergence (Current):** 93.0

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 318.0% | 74.2%  | 257.0%  | 0.0    | 21.9   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** High CAGR values indicate substantial growth over each period.
*   **MDD:**  Relatively high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) suggests significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Strong positive Alpha suggests that IONQ has outperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) even after adjusting for risk.
*   **Beta:**  Low Beta values (near 0) indicate that IONQ's price movements are largely independent of the overall market (S&P 500).  This is not commonly the case, and might be due to the relatively short term, which can skew the beta value.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 53.50

**Analysis:**

The recent price decline, as indicated by the negative change in the last market data, is concerning. The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The sharp negative change from the previous close signals significant selling pressure.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A MRI of 0.8 suggests that the investment is considered medium risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 49.82 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, which can be a bearish signal.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** A 17.2% expected return is attractive, suggesting potential long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 if the investment is held for a long period (2+ years).

**Analysis:**

The news headlines present a mixed picture. While there's acknowledgment of significant past gains and solid liquidity, there are concerns about valuation, net losses, and a potential sector-wide downturn. The repeated emphasis on valuation and losses suggests that investors are scrutinizing the company's fundamentals.

Analyst sentiment is generally positive, with a consensus rating of "Buy." The average target price of $64.62 is slightly above the current price, suggesting some potential upside. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices ($32 to $100) indicates significant uncertainty among analysts.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue        |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2025-08-06 | -0.7   | $0.02 B         |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.14  | $0.01 B         |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24  | $0.01 B         |
| 2024-08-07 | -0.18  | $0.01 B         |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.18  | $0.01 B         |

**Analysis:**

The consistently negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) values are a significant concern. While revenue is growing, the company is not yet profitable. The large negative EPS in the most recent quarter (2025-08-06) is particularly alarming.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $0.02B  | 59.76%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.01B  | 42.97%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B  | 56.92%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B  | 47.46%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.01B  | 50.59%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE        |
|------------|---------|------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $1.16B  | -15.22%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.77B  | -4.22%     |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B  | -52.62%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B  | -12.05%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B  | -8.11%     |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** Revenue is growing, and profit margins are relatively high. This indicates that IONQ's core business model has potential for profitability.
*   **Equity & ROE:** While equity has increased significantly, the consistently negative Return on Equity (ROE) values are a red flag. This indicates that the company is not generating profits from its equity investments. The recent significant negative ROE indicates very poor equity management.

**7. Overall Assessment**

IONQ has demonstrated impressive growth and significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. Analyst sentiment is generally positive. However, there are several important considerations:

*   **Valuation Concerns:** Recent news headlines and the high relative divergence suggest that the stock may be overvalued.
*   **Lack of Profitability:** The consistently negative EPS and ROE values are major concerns. The company needs to demonstrate a clear path to profitability.
*   **Recent Downtrend:** The recent price decline and negative technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback.

**Recommendation:**

Given the high valuation, lack of profitability, and recent downtrend, a cautious approach is warranted. While the long-term potential of quantum computing is undeniable, IONQ's current financial performance and market conditions suggest that investors should exercise caution. Existing investors may consider trimming their positions, while potential investors should wait for a clearer path to profitability and a more favorable entry point. A high-risk, high-reward consideration should be used when looking at a speculative investment.

I hope this comprehensive report is helpful.
