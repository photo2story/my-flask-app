*   **CAGR:** Shows exceptional compounded annual growth. Growth accelerates over time.
*   **MDD:**  High Maximum Drawdown indicates significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Extremely high alpha values suggest substantial outperformance relative to the market risk, indicating the stock's performance is not tied to the overall market movement.
*   **Beta:** Beta is near 0 which suggests that IonQ's price is not correlated with the market.
*   **Cap:** The market capitalization increases dramatically over the time periods analyzed.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** $70.65
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $70.65, Previous Close: $77.5, Change: -8.84 (-8.84%)

*   **60-day Moving Average:** 51.16

**Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. The significant drop from the previous close suggests negative momentum and a potential short-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $0.02B  | 59.76%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.01B  | 42.97%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B  | 56.92%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B  | 47.46%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.01B  | 50.59%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE      |
|------------|----------|----------|
| 2025-06-30 | $1.16B  | -15.22% |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.77B  | -4.22%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B  | -52.62% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B  | -12.05% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B  | -8.11%  |

**Analysis:** Revenue is increasing, and profit margins are relatively high for a growth company. However, the company is still operating at a loss, as reflected in the negative ROE (Return on Equity). Equity has increased significantly, indicating capital raises or retained earnings (though unlikely given the negative profitability). The ROE is trending positively but remains negative.

**7. Overall Summary**

IONQ presents a mixed picture.

*   **Strengths:**  Exceptional historical outperformance vs. the S&P 500, high growth potential in the quantum computing industry, positive news sentiment, strong buy signal from a hybrid algorithm, growing revenue, high profit margins, and increasing equity.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Very high volatility (MDD), negative earnings and ROE, recent sharp price decline, and a current price that exceeds the average analyst target. The recent EPS is significantly worse.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** The high MRI score suggests investment is appropriate. However, the recent market data showing a large price drop requires close consideration.

**Conclusion:**

IONQ is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The company shows promise in a rapidly growing industry, but its lack of profitability and high volatility should be carefully considered. *The recent large price drop warrants caution and further investigation.* Investors should be prepared for significant price swings and conduct thorough due diligence before investing. The long-term outlook, based on expected return and industry growth, remains positive, but the near-term picture is uncertain. A potential strategy would be to average in overtime, rather than taking a lump sum approach.
