*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change suggests the stock has been underperforming relative to its peers in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return (34.2% above the S&P 500) implies significant growth potential in the long term if you invest today and hold for the long term.
