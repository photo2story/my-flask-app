**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ------ |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows extremely high growth rates, particularly in the later periods, reflecting the high-growth nature of the company.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Significant drawdowns indicate high volatility and risk associated with the stock.
*   **Alpha:** Very high alpha values suggest strong outperformance relative to the benchmark, driven by factors specific to IONQ rather than general market movements.
*   **Beta:** A beta of 0 indicates minimal correlation with the S&P 500, which is unusual. This could suggest that IONQ's performance is largely independent of the broader market.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):**  Shows growth in market capitalization over the periods.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 36.79

*   **5-day Moving Average:** 39.02
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 40.87
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 41.51

**Analysis:**

The current price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The last trading session showed a slight decrease, but it's not a dramatic move.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3316 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 42.21 (Neutral, not overbought or oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.32 (Slightly bearish, indicating short-term weakness)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_67%_Sell 5.0% of holdings (76 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 67% on 2025-08-20)  (Suggests a conservative approach, advising to hold a high cash position and reduce exposure slightly).
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day change):** -10.3 (Indicates a recent decrease in relative outperformance compared to VOO).
*   **Expected Return:** 37.7% (Projected excess return over S&P 500 with long-term investment)

**Analysis:**

The MRI suggests a low-risk environment currently.  However, the hybrid signal and the negative change in relative divergence (-10.3) indicate some caution. The PPO further supports a short-term bearish trend. Despite the recent downturn, the long-term expected return is still positive.

The slight decrease in the last trading session (`{'price': 36.79, 'previousClose': 36.8, 'change': -0.03}`) is not significant enough to warrant special consideration as a "volatility issue" in this analysis.

### 7. Summary & Conclusion

IONQ has demonstrated substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500, driven by factors specific to the company, as indicated by its high alpha and low beta. However, this outperformance has seen a short term decrease. Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, and technical indicators signal some caution. The company is not yet profitable, as evidenced by negative EPS and ROE, though revenue is growing. High profit margins suggest that the underlying business has the potential to be profitable once the scale increases and operating expenses decrease. Recent news indicates significant business developments and volatility. Investors should be aware of both the high growth potential and the significant risks associated with IONQ. A conservative approach, as suggested by the hybrid signal, might be prudent, at least in the short term. Long-term prospects appear positive based on the high expected return.
