| Year        | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| 2021-2023   | 84.0%   | 82.3% | 83.0%   | -0.0  | 4.4    |

| 2023-2025   | 325.0%  | 80.5% | 262.0%  | 0.0   | 20.9   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:**  IONQ exhibits extremely high growth rates across all periods, indicating substantial potential returns but also increased risk.
    *   **MDD:**  High MDD values suggest significant volatility and potential for large drawdowns.
    *   **Alpha:**  The high alpha values indicate that IONQ has significantly outperformed its benchmark, suggesting strong stock-specific performance.
    *   **Beta:**  Beta values close to zero suggest IONQ's returns are not strongly correlated with the overall market, potentially offering diversification benefits.
    *   **Market Cap:** The increasing market cap indicates growing investor interest and confidence in the company's future prospects.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** \$59.51
*   **Last Market Data:** Price \$60.3, Previous Close \$59.37, Change: 1.57 (Indicates a recent positive move)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** \$64.12
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** \$70.11
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** \$54.07

**Analysis:** The stock price is below both its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, potentially indicating short-term downward pressure. However, it is significantly above its 60-day moving average, suggesting a longer-term upward trend. The recent price change indicates a rebound from that downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 47.25 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -4.24 (Negative, indicating potential downward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell - Suggesting a risk-averse strategy, recommending selling 80% of holdings due to perceived risk (MRI: 0.50).
*   **Recent (20-Day) Relative Divergence Change:** -28.4 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 31.0% (Projected outperformance versus S&P 500 over 2+ years with regular investment)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation. However, the hybrid signal conflicts with this, recommending a significant reduction in holdings, likely driven by short-term volatility and risk factors. The negative PPO and recent decline in relative divergence suggest caution in the short term. The expected return is promising for long-term investors. The recent price change of 1.57 indicates a rebound/recovery from the downward trend.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:** Several headlines highlight IONQ exceeding market returns, achieving record quantum fidelity, and investor interest.
*   **Cautionary Headlines:** Some articles point to uncertainty surrounding IONQ's business model and the need to consider competition from larger players like IBM and Google.
*   **Cramer's Opinion:** Jim Cramer's comments reflect some skepticism but also underscore the market's attempt to understand the company.

**Analysis:** Recent news presents a mixed picture. Positive developments in quantum fidelity and market performance are balanced by concerns about market understanding and competition.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

    *   Strong analyst consensus ("Buy").
    *   Growing revenue and high profit margins.
    *   Technological advancements in quantum computing.
    *   MRI indicates a favorable investment environment
*   **Negatives:**
    *   High volatility (MDD).
    *   Negative EPS and ROE.
    *   Uncertainty surrounding the business model and competition.

**Recommendation:** Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing. While the long-term potential is significant, the short-term outlook is uncertain. The recent price rebound may indicate a bottom, but the company's profitability and competitive landscape need to be carefully monitored. It may be wise to follow the Hybrid Signal strategy of holding a significant cash position.
