**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

IONQ Inc. is a company focused on developing and commercializing trapped-ion quantum computers.  As shown above, IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. The cumulative return difference of 203.6% highlights a substantial outperformance. The high relative return difference of 73.6% suggests IONQ's performance is in the top 73.6% percentile compared to its historical performance relative to the VOO.  However, it's crucial to note that high beta values (see below) suggest significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0% | 72.8% | 71.0% | 3.0   |
| 2022-2024  | 199.0% | 72.8% | 178.0% | 10.0  |
| 2023-2025  | 223.0% | 67.0% | 207.0% | 6.9   |

The high beta values across all periods indicate IONQ's price is highly sensitive to overall market movements.  The exceptionally high alpha values suggest significant outperformance compared to the market benchmark, though this may not be sustainable in the long term.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects investor interest.  However, the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) underscores the substantial risk associated with investing in IONQ.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $28.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $26.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $24.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $27.93

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price change of $1.80 (1.8%) indicates a relatively small positive daily change.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 72.00 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.52 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 20.5% (Excess return over S&P 500 for long-term investors)

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, potentially indicating a near-term correction. The positive PPO and upward relative divergence support the bullish momentum, but caution is warranted given the RSI reading. The expected return of 20.5% is a substantial premium over the S&P 500, reflecting the high-growth potential and risk associated with IONQ.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.24   | $0.01 B     |
| 2024-08-07 | -$0.18   | $0.01 B     |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.19   | $0.01 B     |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.22   | $0.01 B     |
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.22   | $0.01 B     |

IONQ is currently reporting consistent net losses, indicating it's in a growth phase and not yet profitable. Revenue remains relatively flat.  Further analysis is needed to assess the sustainability of this revenue level and the path to profitability.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B | 56.92% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B | 47.46% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.01B | 50.59% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.01B | 54.97% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.01B | 48.20% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE       |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B | -52.62%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B | -12.05%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B | -8.11%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B | -8.25%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.48B | -8.64%   |

Despite relatively stable revenue, IONQ shows negative Return on Equity (ROE) throughout the period.  The high profit margins reported are likely misleading in the context of significant net losses. This suggests a need for increased operational efficiency or revenue generation to achieve profitability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ demonstrates exceptional growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this comes with substantial risk, as evidenced by the high beta, negative ROE, and consistent net losses. The high RSI suggests a potential short-term correction.  Long-term investors may find the expected excess return attractive, but should carefully consider the volatility and lack of profitability.  Further investigation into the company's strategic plan to achieve profitability and sustainable revenue growth is necessary before making any investment decision.  The current performance is highly impressive, but not indicative of future success.
