The recent price surge and high MRI score might attract investors. However, the lack of profitability, volatility, and sector-specific risks (bubble concerns, competition) should be carefully considered. Recent news headlines are mixed, highlighting both buying opportunities and valuation concerns. Investors should carefully weigh their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing.
