*   **Relative Divergence Change:**  A negative change in relative divergence (-9.9) indicates short-term underperformance relative to the comparison stock (S&P 500).
*   **Expected Return:**  A 48% expected return is very high and suggests substantial future growth potential *if* the investment is held long-term. The analysis emphasizes a 2+ year horizon for realizing this return.
*   **Recent price change issue**: The current price change is 4.39, meaning it will likely be an issue and must be considered.
