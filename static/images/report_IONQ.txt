**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) demonstrates strong growth, although the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggests significant volatility.  The Alpha values suggest substantial outperformance relative to a benchmark (although the benchmark isn't explicitly stated).  A beta close to 0 suggests very low correlation with the market.  The fluctuating market capitalization highlights the company's growth and fluctuations in valuation.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.01B  | 56.92%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.01B  | 47.46%        |

| 2023-12-31  | $0.01B  | 48.20%        |

High profit margins are reported, despite negative EPS, which suggests accounting methodologies or other factors may need to be investigated.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity  | ROE       |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.38B  | -52.62%   |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.44B  | -12.05%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.46B  | -8.11%    |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.48B  | -8.25%    |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.48B  | -8.64%    |

Negative ROE (Return on Equity) across all quarters indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity investment.  The significant drop in equity in the final quarter is notable and requires further investigation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

IONQ exhibits significant growth potential, as evidenced by its high CAGR and substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, several red flags exist:  the high volatility (indicated by the MDD), consistent negative EPS, and the recent sharp price drop raise concerns.  The company is not currently profitable, and the negative ROE, especially the drastic drop in Q4 2024, warrants further investigation into the company's financials and future prospects.  The high profit margins reported seem to conflict with the negative EPS and warrant further review of accounting practices.  While the long-term expected return is attractive, investors should exercise caution due to the current high-risk profile and negative profitability.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
