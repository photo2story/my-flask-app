**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company.  Over the periods shown, IONQ has drastically outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), as evidenced by a significantly higher cumulative return (240.16% vs 21.42%). The large relative divergence (78.3%) further emphasizes this outperformance relative to its historical range of divergence. However, the high beta values suggest significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0% | 72.8% | 71.0% | 0.1 | 3.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 199.0% | 72.8% | 178.0% | 0.0 | 10.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 242.0% | 67.0% | 223.0% | 0.1 | 7.5 |

The high alpha values (especially in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025) suggest that IONQ generated significant returns above what would be expected based on market performance and its beta.  However, the changing beta values across the years indicate varying market sensitivities.  The fluctuating market capitalization also reflects this volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $30.92
* **5-day Moving Average:** $28.51
* **20-day Moving Average:** $26.02
* **60-day Moving Average:** $26.90

The closing price is significantly above all three moving averages, indicating a recent price surge.  The relatively large difference between the closing price and the 20-day and 60-day moving averages suggests a rapid price increase.  The Last-market data shows a dramatic 12.93% increase from the previous close, clearly indicating a significant price jump.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 66.74 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.82 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 18.2% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 projected)

The combination of a relatively high RSI and positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although the RSI nearing overbought levels might indicate a potential short-term correction. The substantial price increase (12.93%) points to a recent surge. The high expected return, exceeding 18% above the S&P 500, indicates a substantial potential for long-term growth, however this is just a projection and subject to change.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ has shown exceptional historical growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to note the company's current unprofitability, despite positive momentum reflected in recent price action and technical indicators. The high beta suggests considerable risk.  The recent sharp price increase warrants caution, as it might indicate overbought conditions.  Long-term investors should carefully weigh the potential for high growth against the substantial risks associated with the company's current financial performance and high volatility.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price surge and the company's long-term profitability strategy is strongly recommended.  The accuracy of the provided data and any potential errors (like the duplicate earnings data point) should also be verified.
