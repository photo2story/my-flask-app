As of the last data point, IONQ's cumulative return is 186.08%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 62.35%. The difference is 123.73%, placing it at the 81.47th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

**Provided Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

IONQ exhibits significant short-term outperformance against the S&P 500, driven by substantial volatility (high Beta). However, consistent negative EPS and ROE raise significant concerns about its long-term financial health and sustainability. The recent price action shows signs of both strength (above the 20- and 60-day moving averages) and potential weakness (below the 5-day moving average and the negative expected return). The high RSI suggests caution. Further investigation is needed into the news, analyst sentiment, and the reasons behind the current financial results before forming a definitive opinion about IONQ's investment potential.
