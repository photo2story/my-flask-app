The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, alongside significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD). The beta values indicate high volatility relative to the market (values > 1), fluctuating significantly between periods.  Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance compared to the market, but these fluctuate as well.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) demonstrates market interest and company growth.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0% | 72.8% | 73.0% | 0.2 | 3.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 199.0% | 72.8% | 180.0% | 0.0 | 10.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 190.0% | 67.0% | 179.0% | 0.4 | 6.2 |

* **Closing Price:** $25.89
* **Previous Close:** $26.37
* **Change:** -$0.48 (-1.82%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $23.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $23.64
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $30.35

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.45 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 2.44 (Positive; suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 26.4% (Long-term, 2+ years, exceeding S&P 500)

The recent price drop of -1.82% should be noted, but it's not a drastic fall. The positive PPO and increasing relative divergence suggest some potential for upward movement, but the MRI indicates a degree of market risk. The high expected return is promising but needs to be considered in the context of the high volatility shown in the Beta analysis.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company consistently reports negative EPS and low revenue.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of these numbers and what drives the relatively high stock price considering the lack of profitability.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.24 | $0.01 B       |
| 2024-08-07 | -$0.18 | $0.01 B       |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.19 | $0.01 B       |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.22 | $0.01 B       |
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.22 | $0.01 B       |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is consistently low. While the profit margin shows some variability, it generally remains relatively high.  However, the negative ROE (Return on Equity) is a major concern, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investment.  This needs careful consideration.


Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B | 56.92% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B | 47.46% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.01B | 50.59% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.01B | 54.97% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.01B | 48.20% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity | ROE     |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B | -52.62% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B | -12.05% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B | -8.11% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B | -8.25% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.48B | -8.64% |



**6) Overall Analysis:**

IONQ exhibits a high growth potential based on its substantial historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this comes with significant volatility (high beta and MDD). The negative EPS and ROE raise serious concerns about the company's financial health and long-term sustainability.  The high profit margins could be a positive sign, but it needs further investigation considering the low revenue.  The expected high long-term returns should be viewed cautiously, given the inherent risks associated with the company's current financial performance and the potential for significant price swings.  More in-depth financial modeling and due diligence are needed before making any investment decisions.  Consider the substantial risk before investing.
