    *   High volatility and MDD indicating substantial downside risk.
    *   Recent price decline below moving averages, signaling a potential downtrend.
    *   Mixed news sentiment with price declines and high loss expectations mentioned.

**Investment Recommendation:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is warranted.

*   **Short-Term:** Considering the recent price drop and Hybrid Signal, reducing exposure might be prudent in the short term.
