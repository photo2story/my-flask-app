**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) based on cumulative return. The divergence is substantial, indicating a high level of outperformance. The relative divergence of 63.6 suggests that the current outperformance is above the median of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** IONQ demonstrates very high compound annual growth rates (CAGR) across all periods, increasing from 84% to 294%.
*   **MDD:** The maximum drawdown (MDD) is high, indicating significant volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:** High positive alpha indicates IONQ's performance is exceeding what would be expected based on market returns alone. This suggests strong company-specific factors driving performance.
*   **Beta:** Beta is near 0, meaning the correlation between the market return and stock return is very minimal.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has significantly increased over time, reflecting investor confidence and growth of the company.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -3.58  | $0.04B      |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.7   | $0.02B      |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.14  | $0.01B      |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24  | $0.01B      |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.24  | $0.01B      |

**Analysis:** IONQ is currently unprofitable, as indicated by the negative EPS values. Revenue is growing but is still relatively small. The EPS is quite erratic, with the most recent EPS dramatically worse than previous quarters. This could be due to any number of one-time factors, but it's a cause for concern.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.04B | 46.69% |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.02B | 59.76% |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.01B | 42.97% |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B | 56.92% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B | 47.46% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-09-30 | $2.27B | -46.41% |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.16B | -15.22% |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.77B | -4.22% |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B | -52.62% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B | -12.05% |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** Revenue is growing, which is positive. Profit margins are reasonably high, indicating good efficiency in generating profit from sales, but this should be viewed in light of the overall lack of profitability.
*   **Equity & ROE:** Equity has increased dramatically over the past year, likely due to capital raises. The negative ROE values confirm the company's unprofitability. The high ROE loss in the most recent quarter reflects the large EPS loss.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk quantum computing company.

*   **Strengths:** Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, high growth rates (CAGR), strong analyst ratings, positive news sentiment, increasing revenue, and substantial equity growth. Potential for large future return.
*   **Weaknesses:** High volatility (MDD), negative earnings (EPS), negative ROE, relatively high valuation, a recent decline in relative divergence, and significant technological risk inherent in the quantum computing sector.
*   **Overall:** IONQ presents a compelling investment opportunity for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. The company is well-positioned in a rapidly growing industry, and analyst sentiment is positive. However, the lack of profitability and the high volatility require careful consideration.

**Key Considerations for Investors:**

*   **Quantum Computing is Nascent:** The quantum computing industry is still in its early stages. Success is not guaranteed, and technological breakthroughs by competitors could impact IONQ's prospects.
*   **Valuation:** Growth stocks like IONQ can be highly valued. Be prepared for significant price swings.
*   **Monitor Financial Performance:** Pay close attention to revenue growth, cost management, and progress towards profitability.
*   **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date on industry developments, competitor activities, and any news related to IONQ.

In conclusion, IONQ is a promising but risky investment. Its significant outperformance and positive outlook are tempered by current unprofitability and the inherent uncertainties of the quantum computing industry. A well-informed and risk-tolerant investor may find this an attractive opportunity.
