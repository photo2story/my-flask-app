2025-12-07 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of IONQ, based on the data you provided, broken down into the requested sections:

**1) Return Rate Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc is a company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.

*   **Return Comparison:**
    *   IONQ Cumulative Return: 288.84%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 49.15%
    *   Divergence: 249.0 (Relative Divergence: 66.0)

*   **Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period.  The divergence of 249.0, with a relative divergence of 66.0, indicates that the current outperformance is well within the historical range, but leaning towards the higher end. The high return comes with a high risk, of course.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
    |------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
    | 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3%  | 83.0%  | -0.0  | 4.8    |
    | 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 82.3%  | 188.0% | -0.0  | 16.0   |
    | 2023-2025  | 295.0% | 79.6%  | 230.0% | 0.0   | 18.7   |

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows impressive annual growth, accelerating over the most recent periods.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD figures indicate substantial risk and volatility in IONQ's price.
    *   **Alpha:** Very high Alpha values suggest significant outperformance compared to a risk-free investment. This is the return generated *above* what would be expected for the level of risk (as measured by Beta).
    *   **Beta:** Beta hovering around 0.0 implies that IONQ's price is not strongly correlated with the broader market (S&P 500). This could mean its performance is driven by factors specific to the company or the quantum computing industry.
    *   **Cap(B):** The Market Capitalization (in Billions).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** \$48.66
*   **Last Market Data:** Price = \$52.69, Previous Close = \$54.76, Change = -\$3.78
*   **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**
    *   5-day SMA: \$47.76
    *   20-day SMA: \$49.26
    *   60-day SMA: \$59.93

*   **Analysis:** The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, which suggests a short-term downward trend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, further confirming this. The 60-day SMA is significantly higher, indicating that the longer-term trend might still be positive but is weakening. The recent price fluctuation (price: 52.69, previousClose: 54.76, change: -3.78) is large, reflect the fluctuation issue (sharp rebound, sharp decline).

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 46.56
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.93
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (21 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 38.3%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A value of 0.8 suggests that, based on the model, the investment is considered to have medium risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 46.56 is near neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO suggests a slight upward momentum, but it's not a strong signal.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests going all-in (100% cash allocation) with a relatively small monthly investment and deems the stock as "Very Safe," but it is important to note that this is likely due to the model favoring stocks trending downward.
    *   **Divergence Change:** A negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days points to recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   **Expected Return:** A 38.3% expected return (over 2 years) is optimistic, suggesting the model anticipates continued strong growth.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **[2025-12-04] Time to Buy Quantum Stocks? (QBTS, IONQ, RGTI) - Zacks Investment Research:** Suggests a potentially positive outlook for the quantum computing sector, including IONQ.
*   **[2025-12-05] QBTS Fortifies Its Balance Sheet Amid Competition With IONQ, RGTI - Nasdaq:** Highlights increasing competition within the quantum computing space.  QBTS strengthening its balance sheet could intensify competitive pressures for IONQ.

*   **Analysis:** The news indicates both opportunity and risk. The positive article from Zacks suggests potential for sector growth. However, the Nasdaq article points to increased competition, which could put pressure on IONQ's market share and profitability.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:**
    *   Key: Buy
    *   Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell): 1.78 (~Buy)
    *   Opinions: 10
    *   Target Price (avg/high/low): \$72.35 / \$100.00 / \$47.00

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and a mean rating around 1.78. The average target price of \$72.35 suggests significant upside potential from the current price of around \$48.66. However, the range of target prices is wide (\$47 to \$100), indicating some disagreement among analysts about IONQ's future value.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue    |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -3.58 | \$0.04B    |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.70 | \$0.02B    |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.14 | \$0.01B    |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24 | \$0.01B    |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.24 | \$0.01B    |

*   **Analysis:** IONQ is currently unprofitable. The EPS (Earnings Per Share) is negative in all reported quarters. Revenue is growing, but losses are significant, especially the most recent EPS of -3.58. This implies that the company is spending heavily to fuel its growth. While revenue is increasing, the growing EPS losses should be watched closely.

**6) Financial Information: Revenue, Profitability, Capital**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

    | Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
    |------------|----------|---------------|
    | 2025-09-30 | \$0.04B  | 46.69%        |
    | 2025-06-30 | \$0.02B  | 59.76%        |
    | 2025-03-31 | \$0.01B  | 42.97%        |
    | 2024-12-31 | \$0.01B  | 56.92%        |
    | 2024-09-30 | \$0.01B  | 47.46%        |

*   **Capital and Profitability:**

    | Quarter    | Equity    | ROE       |
    |------------|-----------|-----------|
    | 2025-09-30 | \$2.27B   | -46.41%   |
    | 2025-06-30 | \$1.16B   | -15.22%   |
    | 2025-03-31 | \$0.77B   | -4.22%    |
    | 2024-12-31 | \$0.38B   | -52.62%   |
    | 2024-09-30 | \$0.44B   | -12.05%   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue:** Revenue is increasing quarter over quarter, a positive sign.
    *   **Profit Margin:** Gross profit margins are high (above 40%), suggesting IONQ has pricing power and efficient cost of goods sold. However, this does not translate into overall profitability due to high operating expenses (R&D, marketing, etc.).
    *   **Equity:** Equity has been increasing, reflecting capital raises or retained losses (though the latter is unlikely given the EPS figures).
    *   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is significantly negative, reflecting the company's unprofitability. The negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating profits from its equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Overall:** IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk company in the emerging quantum computing sector.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 historically.
    *   Strong revenue growth and high gross profit margins.
    *   Positive analyst consensus with a significant upside target price.
    *   Innovative technology in a potentially disruptive industry.

*   **Negatives/Risks:**
    *   High volatility and significant maximum drawdowns.
    *   Currently unprofitable with large and increasing EPS losses.
    *   Increasing competition in the quantum computing space.
    *   Low correlation with the broader market, making it difficult to predict performance based on macro trends.
    *   Negative ROE, indicating that the company is not generating profits from its equity.

*   **Investment Recommendation:** Based on the data, investing in IONQ is speculative and should only be considered by investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. While the potential for significant returns exists, the company's unprofitability and high volatility should be carefully considered. The news and analyst opinions are generally positive, but the underlying financial metrics warrant caution. Monitoring the company's progress in achieving profitability and managing competition is crucial.
