*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of profitability, high volatility (MDD), recent price weakness, negative news sentiment, and a "Sell" hybrid signal.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the high volatility and mixed signals, a very cautious approach is warranted. While the long-term potential is significant, the short-term risks are also substantial.
