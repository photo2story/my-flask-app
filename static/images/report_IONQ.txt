IONQ Inc. is a company developing trapped-ion quantum computers.  As of the last data point, IONQ's cumulative return (186.08%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (62.35%).

**Table 1: Alpha and Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 14.7% | 82.5% | -20.2% | 2.4 | 2.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 44.4% | 70.7% | 16.0% | 2.5 | 6.3 |

The high beta values (2.4 and 2.5) suggest IONQ's price is highly volatile and sensitive to market movements. The positive alpha in 2022-2024 indicates it potentially outperformed the market after adjusting for risk.  However, the negative alpha in 2021-2023 suggests underperformance during that period.

* **Closing Price:** $25.23 (Last Market: $26.35)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $26.06
* **20-day Moving Average:** $19.53
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.33

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a recent sharp increase.  The last market price of $26.35  suggests a minor recent pullback.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (66.28):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (1.73):** Positive, indicating upward momentum.

The combination of a relatively high RSI and a positive PPO suggests a potentially overbought market but with sustained momentum.  The large positive change in relative strength further supports this.  The relatively high current price indicates a sharp recent increase, not necessarily reflective of long-term trends.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ demonstrates significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility. While showing short-term upward momentum, the stock's high RSI suggests potential short-term correction.  Negative EPS and ROE highlight ongoing financial losses, despite positive profit margins.  Further analysis of recent news and earnings reports, including analyst forecasts, is crucial to assess its long-term prospects.  The -0.02% expected return suggests that despite historical outperformance,  long-term returns may not significantly exceed the S&P 500, especially considering the current financial status of the company.
