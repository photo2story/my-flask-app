2025-11-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of IONQ based on the data you provided.

**Company Overview:**

IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company.

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 290.64%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 42.66%
*   **Divergence:** 248.0 (Relative Divergence: 65.8)

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. However, the relative divergence of 65.8 suggests this outperformance is not at its highest point compared to its historical range. It means its current position is 65.8% between the minimum and maximum divergence.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%   | 82.3% | 83.0%   | -0.0   | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0%  | 82.3% | 188.0%  | -0.0   | 14.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 297.0%  | 79.6% | 238.0%  | 0.0   | 14.8   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  IONQ has demonstrated substantial Compound Annual Growth Rates.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown figures suggest significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Strong positive Alpha indicates that IONQ has outperformed its expected return based on its risk profile.
*   **Beta:** Beta close to 0 suggests very low systematic risk.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap shows market cap in Billions

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 41.67
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 41.71, Previous Close: 41.00, Change: 1.73
*   **5-day SMA:** 45.49
*   **20-day SMA:** 53.40
*   **60-day SMA:** 59.30

**Analysis:**  The stock is currently trading below all its Simple Moving Averages (SMA).  This, along with the small price change, typically suggests a short-term downward trend or consolidation after a longer period of decline, but the small price increase on the last market day may be showing a potential rebound.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.52 (Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Sell 80% of holdings (3082 shares - Risky - MRI: 0.50, Cash Ratio: 80% on 2025-10-16)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 38.2% (Long-term, compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   An RSI of 27.52 indicates the stock is oversold, which can suggest a potential buying opportunity, although it can also indicate continued downward momentum.
*   The negative PPO supports the idea of a recent downward trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal, advocating selling 80% of holdings, reinforces the cautious outlook.
*   The decline in relative divergence further confirms the short-term downward trend.
*   The 38.2% expected return is optimistic for long-term investors, but this is balanced by the shorter-term bearish signals.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Discount Opportunity:** Some articles suggest IONQ stock is a discount opportunity.
*   **Analyst Hesitation:** J.P. Morgan is staying on the sidelines.
*   **Long-Term Potential:**  Some articles speculate on IONQ's potential as a future trillion-dollar company.
*   **Institutional Investor Activity:**  Reports indicate institutional investors recently increased positions but may regret it,
*   **Sector Positioning:** IONQ is seen as well-positioned within the quantum computing sector.
*   **Recent Plunge:** Other articles highlight a recent plunge in the stock price, raising questions about buying the dip.

**Analysis:**  The news is mixed. While some sources highlight long-term potential and possible discount opportunities, others point to institutional investor concerns and recent price declines. Analyst opinions appear divided, reflecting the inherent uncertainty of the quantum computing sector.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.78)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 72.35, High: 100.00, Low: 47.00

**Analysis:**  Despite the recent volatility, the analyst consensus remains positive, with a "Buy" rating and a significantly higher average target price compared to the current price. However, the wide range in target prices reflects the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future.  The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess if analysts are reacting to the latest price movements.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue   |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | -3.58 | $0.04 B  |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.70 | $0.02 B  |

| 2025-11-06 | -0.24 | $0.01 B  |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.24 | $0.01 B  |

**Analysis:**  IONQ has consistently reported negative EPS (Earnings Per Share), indicating unprofitability. While revenue is growing, the EPS is negative in all of the recent reported quarterly earnings. It's important to monitor the EPS growth.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.04B  | 46.69%          |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.02B  | 59.76%          |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $2.27B  | -46.41%   |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.16B  | -15.22%   |

| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B  | -12.05%   |

**Analysis:** Revenue is growing, and the Profit Margin is relatively high. However, the negative ROE (Return on Equity) reflects the company's current lack of profitability.  Although equity is increasing, the ROE reflects the growth not being translated to profitability.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock in the emerging quantum computing sector.

*   **Strengths:** Significant outperformance vs S&P 500 historically, strong revenue growth, high-profit margins, positive analyst consensus, promising long-term potential.
*   **Weaknesses:** High volatility (MDD), current downward price trend, negative earnings, negative ROE, mixed news sentiment, J.P. Morgan is on the sidelines.

**Overall Recommendation:** The data suggests a cautious approach. While IONQ offers potentially high long-term rewards, it also carries significant risk. The current technical indicators suggest a possible oversold condition, but the short-term trend is downward. Investors should carefully weigh their risk tolerance, conduct thorough due diligence, and consider a smaller allocation within a diversified portfolio. Monitor the company's progress toward profitability and any changes in analyst sentiment.
