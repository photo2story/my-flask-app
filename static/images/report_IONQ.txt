Okay, here's a report analyzing IONQ based on the provided data.

**IONQ Inc. Analysis**

**0. Executive Summary**

IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company that builds trapped ion quantum computers. IONQ's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in recent years.  However, recent market indicators suggest caution, and analyst opinions are mixed.  The company is experiencing rapid revenue growth but struggles with profitability.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Cumulative Return (IONQ):** 322.66%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 50.10%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** 269.3
*   **Relative Divergence:** 70.9

**Analysis:** IONQ has drastically outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. A relative divergence of 70.9 indicates that the current divergence is well above the average historical range, but not at the extreme.
**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
| :----------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :---- | :------- |
| 2021-2023 | 84.0%  | 82.3%  | 83.0%  | -0.0 | 4.3    |
| 2022-2024 | 208.0% | 82.3%  | 188.0% | -0.0 | 14.5   |
| 2023-2025 | 329.0% | 79.6%  | 263.0% | 0.0  | 21.7   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is exceptionally high and increasing significantly over the periods.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is also very high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are very high, implying significant outperformance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are around zero, indicating that IONQ's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This can be typical for growth stocks in emerging sectors.
*    **Cap(B):** Market capitalization is increasing.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 62.38
*   **Previous Close:** 60.17
*   **Change:** 3.67
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 60.726
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 66.9861
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 56.6795

**Analysis:** The current price shows a recent upward swing, given the positive change. However, the price is below the 20-day moving average but above the 60-day moving average, which suggests the stock is facing short-term downward pressure but has positive long-term momentum.  The significant change from the previous close indicates a notable market reaction.

**3. Market Risk Indicators**

*   **RSI:** 28.94 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.77
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell (80% of holdings recommended)
*   **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.4 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 32.0%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests that the market conditions are favorable for investment.
*   The RSI indicates that the stock may be oversold and could rebound.
*   The PPO indicates the price is below its moving average.
*   Despite the seemingly high MRI score, the Hybrid Signal recommends selling 80% of holdings due to risk (MRI: 0.50 for the specific signal calculation).  This conflicting signal should be considered carefully.
*   The positive change in relative divergence suggests a potential for short-term gains relative to the benchmark.
*   A 32% expected return suggests potential for long-term outperformance, assuming a buy-and-hold strategy.

| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B | -8.11%   |

**Analysis:**  Revenue is showing growth, and profit margins are relatively high for a growth company. However, the negative ROE (Return on Equity) confirms the lack of profitability and indicates that the company is not generating profits from its equity. Equity is also volatile.

**7. Overall Assessment**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock.  It has significantly outperformed the market, but its valuation is under scrutiny. Key takeaways:

*   **Strengths:**  Exceptional revenue growth potential, leading position in a promising sector (quantum computing), very high Alpha.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of profitability, high volatility (MDD), conflicting market risk signals, analyst concerns about valuation.
*   **Recommendation:** Due to market signal conflicts and analyst concerns, conservative investors should approach with caution. The positive long-term return and high growth make it a speculative buy for risk-tolerant investors. A gradual approach is recommended, considering recent downward short-term movement, waiting for a more favorable entry point given the recent market action.
