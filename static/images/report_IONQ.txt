**Performance Analysis:**

IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, exhibiting a considerably higher cumulative return. The large difference highlights the high-growth potential, but also the higher risk, associated with this technology stock. The relative divergence suggests that its current outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.


**CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) for IONQ, indicating strong growth potential. However, the high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) underscore significant risk.  The alpha values suggest periods of outperformance compared to the market (positive alpha), while the beta values are consistently high, reflecting a high sensitivity to market fluctuations. This means that the price changes more than the average market price. The increasing beta values over time might be correlated to increasing investor attention and higher volatility, due to market shifts or company-specific news.

* **Closing Price:** $25.56
* **5-day MA:** $25.06
* **20-day MA:** $24.21
* **60-day MA:** $28.47

The price is currently below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend. However, itâ€™s above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicating recent upward momentum.  The recent price change of 6.37% shows a significant one-day jump.


**Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.49 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.51 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.8% (Short-term downward trend)

The relatively high RSI and positive PPO suggest bullish momentum, but the negative relative divergence change and medium risk level (MRI) indicate potential for a short-term correction.  The recent significant price increase (6.37%) might reflect news or market sentiment changes that warrant further investigation.


**Expected Return and Conclusion:**

The expected return of 31.2% over the long term (2+ years) represents a significant premium compared to the S&P 500.  However,  given the high beta and historical volatility, this high potential return comes with substantial risk.  The stock shows high growth potential, but careful risk management is crucial.  Further analysis is needed to explore the reasons behind the recent price jump. Further due diligence, including considering news, company financials, and competitor analysis, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
