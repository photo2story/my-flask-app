**Overall Recommendation:**

Investing in IONQ is high-risk, high-reward proposition. The company's innovative technology and potential for future growth are attractive, but its lack of profitability, volatile stock price, and mixed analyst opinions warrant caution. Due diligence is required. The user should also assess their own risk tolerance, the recent news articles, and determine if the potential for future return outweighs the risk. The recent negative EPS and negative ROE should be investigated.
