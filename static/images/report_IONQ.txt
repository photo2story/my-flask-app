2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of IONQ's performance based on the data provided, followed by a comprehensive analysis:

**1. Return Rate Analysis:**

*   **Ticker:** IONQ
*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc is a quantum computing company.
*   **Cumulative Return (IONQ):** 269.30%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 45.30%
*   **Divergence:** 224.0 (Relative Divergence: 59.5)

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return.  The divergence of 224.0 indicates a substantial difference in performance. The relative divergence of 59.5 suggests that the current divergence is in the middle of its historical range, meaning it's not at an extreme high or low compared to past performance.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 50.9% | 83.0%  | 2.4  | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 58.7% | 189.0% | 2.6  | 14.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 265.0% | 63.6% | 203.0% | 2.8  | 15.9   |

**Analysis:** The table shows strong growth for IONQ but high volatility.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Very high, indicating rapid growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Also high, indicating significant risk and price volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Substantial positive Alpha suggests that IONQ is outperforming its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:**  High Beta (above 1) indicates that IONQ is more volatile than the overall market. It is more sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B) - Capitalization (Billions):** Shows an increase in the company's capitalization over time.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 46.77
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 46.77, 'previousClose': 44.87, 'change': 4.23}
*   **5-day SMA:** 45.64
*   **20-day SMA:** 49.53
*   **60-day SMA:** 54.4832

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a recent downtrend.
*   The price is above the 5-day SMA, indicating a potential short-term rebound, which is consistent with the positive change in the "Last-market" data point.
* The positive change in the last market data reflects short term volatility and potential instability.

**3. Index Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 41.22
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.5051
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (21 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -6.2 (단기하락 - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 49.4%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests moderate risk levels.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 41.22 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends being fully invested in IONQ with small monthly investments. The 'Very Safe' descriptor seems contradictory given the earlier volatility analysis; rely on the MRI and other indicators.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence reinforces the indication of a short-term downtrend.
*   **Expected Return:**  A high expected return (49.4%) is attractive but must be weighed against the high volatility and risk.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines show a mixed perspective on IONQ. Some articles are optimistic, discussing potential upside and comparing it favorably to competitors. Others are more cautious, questioning whether to buy the dip and highlighting alternative quantum computing stocks.
*   The fact that articles are directly comparing IONQ to competitors (QBTS, IBM, Google, D-Wave, Rigetti) underscores the competitive landscape of the quantum computing industry.
*   The mention of billionaire investment in *other* quantum computing stocks may indicate increased attention and investment in the sector as a whole, but also highlights that IONQ is not necessarily the sole focus of major investors.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:**  No specific consensus rating provided.
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 74.89 / 100.00 / 47.00

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

**Summary:**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock in the emerging quantum computing industry. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but with much greater volatility.

IONQ is suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. The quantum computing industry is still in its early stages, and IONQ's success is not guaranteed. It requires deep research into the company's technology, competitive landscape, and financial health. The recent downturn may present a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors, but caution is advised.
