## IONQ Inc. (IONQ) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

IONQ Inc. is a company focused on developing quantum computing technology.

The cumulative return of IONQ is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last day in the provided data, IONQ's cumulative return is 468.72%, while VOO's is 37.39%.  This results in a divergence of 431.3%, placing it at the 96.9th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. The provided CAGR data shows extremely high growth rates, but also high maximum drawdown (MDD) indicating significant volatility.  The Alpha consistently reported as 0.0 suggests the outperformance relative to the market is not consistently explained by traditional market risk (Beta).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $49.59
* **Last Market Price:** $29.25 (This discrepancy needs clarification; it's unclear which price is most current.)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $46.66
* **20-day Moving Average:** $41.17
* **60-day Moving Average:** $28.71

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, but the large difference between the closing price and last market price requires further investigation.  The significant gap between the closing price and the 60-day average points to a recent surge in the stock price.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.14 –  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, sitting in neutral territory.
* **PPO:** -0.21 – A negative value indicates bearish momentum.  This contrasts with the recent price surge and warrants further analysis.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.9 – Indicates short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -0.8% – This suggests a negative expected return over a long-term horizon compared to the S&P 500.  This needs clarification; it's unclear what time horizon this prediction covers. The significant disparity between this and the historical data needs to be explained.  The 29.25 Last-Market value, if significantly lower than the closing price, may indicate a recent dramatic price jump, and this must be taken into consideration for this expected return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistently negative EPS and relatively flat revenue around $0.01B for the last five quarters. There is no clear revenue growth trend. EPS is consistently negative, with minor fluctuations around -0.20.  There's no information on whether these results beat or missed expectations, as those expectations are not provided.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains consistently low at $0.01B across all quarters. Profit margins fluctuate significantly, suggesting inconsistent profitability.  The high profit margins in some quarters are not necessarily indicative of long-term sustainable profitability given the consistently low revenue.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has slightly decreased, and Return on Equity (ROE) remains consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating a return on its shareholders' equity. This is a major concern.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Therefore, no analysis can be performed on this point.  Information on the market outlook is also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ shows exceptionally high cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by high volatility and consistently negative EPS and ROE. The recent price surge is not fully explained by the provided fundamental data. The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 contrasts sharply with the historical performance, requiring further investigation. The discrepancy between the Closing Price and Last-Market price needs resolution.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with positive short-term momentum countered by negative PPO and a low RSI.  Additional information, such as analyst forecasts, news events, and a resolution to the price discrepancy is needed for a more complete and reliable assessment. The lack of consistent profitability and negative ROE is a major red flag, overshadowing the impressive historical returns.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data provided, IONQ exhibits high growth potential but significant risks. The extremely high volatility, consistently negative EPS and ROE, and the lack of recent news and market context make a conclusive assessment impossible.  Further investigation and data are crucial before forming a well-informed investment opinion.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent price surge and an understanding of the company's long-term growth strategy are needed.  The information provided raises serious concerns about the sustainability of the company's performance.
