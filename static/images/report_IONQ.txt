Okay, here's an analysis of IONQ based on the provided data, presented in English with key figures first, followed by a more detailed breakdown:

**IONQ Stock Analysis**

**Summary:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company showing very high growth potential and recent positive momentum, but also carries significant risk and volatility. Recent news and analyst ratings are positive, but earnings and profitability metrics suggest caution.

**1. Relative Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **Cumulative Return (IONQ):** 393.16%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 55.82%

*   **Relative Divergence (Range Percentile):** 87.8% (Indicates IONQ's outperformance is near the high end of its historical range relative to VOO)

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The high relative divergence percentile suggests this outperformance is historically significant, but not sustainable.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD  | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0%  | 72.8% | 75.0%  | -0.0 | 3.7    |

*   **CAGR:** Extremely high, indicating rapid growth.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown indicates significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Very positive Alpha values suggest the stock is generating returns above what would be expected based on market movements.
*   **Beta:** Close to zero, the stock's price is theoretically independent of the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** High capitalization implies stability, but this may be misleading given the extreme volatility and risks.

*   **20-day Moving Average:** 41.84
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 42.10

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock in the emerging quantum computing sector. It has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by positive news flow and investor enthusiasm. However, the company is not yet profitable, and its valuation may be stretched. While recent news is overwhelmingly positive, investors should be aware of the potential for volatility and the long-term nature of the investment. A low-risk market environment (low MRI) may allow for a higher allocation in the portfolio. Be mindful of short-term volatility due to high RSI.
