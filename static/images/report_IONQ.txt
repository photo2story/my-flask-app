**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year        | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
| :---------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :--- | :----- |
| 2021-2023   | 84.0%  | 82.3%  | 83.0%  | -0.0  | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024   | 208.0% | 82.3%  | 188.0% | -0.0 | 14.8   |
| 2023-2025   | 297.0% | 79.6%  | 238.0% | 0.0  | 14.8   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** IONQ's Compounded Annual Growth Rate is very high.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is also substantial, suggesting significant volatility.
    *   **Alpha:**  High positive alpha indicates IONQ is generating returns above what would be expected based on market movements.
    *   **Beta:** Beta near zero suggests IONQ's price is relatively independent of the S&P 500.  This might be misleading given its high alpha, but the data suggests the stock's movement isn't closely tied to the broader market.
    *   **Cap(B):** The capitalization information isn't really suitable for analysis.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 41.67
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 41.71, 'previousClose': 41.0, 'change': 1.73}  (This shows a slight recent increase.)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 45.49
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 53.40
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 59.30

*   **Analysis:**  The current price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend. The fact that the 5-day moving average is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages further reinforces this bearish signal. The minor increase in the last market is not enough to offset the downwards trend.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 27.52 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -2.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell (80% cash position recommended)
*   **Recent Relative Outperformance Change (20 days):** -0.8 (Downward trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 38.2%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The RSI in oversold territory suggests the stock *could* be due for a bounce, but should be interpreted cautiously within the context of other indicators.
    *   The negative PPO also confirms the downward trend.
    *   The "cash_80%_Sell" hybrid signal suggests a strong risk-off stance.
    *   The negative change in relative outperformance emphasizes recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   While the long-term expected return is positive, the short-term indicators are concerning. The recent increase in price from 41.0 to 41.71, while positive, needs to be observed further to see if it turns into a strong upward trend.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:** Several articles highlight IONQ's potential in quantum computing, even comparing it to Nvidia. There's also coverage on institutional investor interest.
*   **Negative Headlines:** Some articles warn about institutional investors potentially regretting their investments in IONQ and other quantum computing stocks. There's also mention of IONQ shares plummeting along with other tech stocks.
*   **Key Themes:**

**7. Overall Assessment**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock in the emerging quantum computing sector. While it has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, recent technical indicators suggest a potential downturn. News headlines present a mixed picture, and the company is currently unprofitable.

**Recommendation:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is warranted. The analyst consensus is "Buy," but the recent negative trends in price, technical indicators, and earnings suggest it may be prudent to wait for a clearer signal of recovery before initiating or adding to a position. Consider the high volatility and long-term nature of quantum computing as an investment. Monitoring future earnings reports and news developments will be crucial.
