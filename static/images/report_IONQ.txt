*   **Financial Risk:** The company is currently unprofitable and relies on external funding.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** The quantum computing industry is becoming increasingly competitive, and IONQ faces challenges from established tech companies and other startups.

**Recommendation:**

A speculative "Hold" rating is appropriate. IONQ has tremendous long-term potential. The short-term risks (negative earnings, high volatility) require caution.
