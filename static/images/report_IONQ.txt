*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being positive suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating a bullish trend.
*   **Relative Divergence:** The negative change in relative divergence signals a short-term decline in IONQ's outperformance compared to VOO. This should be monitored.
*   **Expected Return:**  The high expected return (42.5%) suggests significant long-term potential, but comes with the caveat of being an estimate contingent on the company's success and long-term investment horizon.

**7. Conclusion**

IONQ Inc. presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. Its quantum computing technology has driven significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, as reflected in its high Alpha and low Beta. However, the company is currently unprofitable, relying on high volatility.

The recent surge in price, combined with the low MRI and favorable Hybrid Signal, may attract investors. However, the recent negative change in relative divergence suggests caution, and the company is currently unprofitable.
