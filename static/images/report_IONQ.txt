## IONQ (IonQ Inc.) Analysis

**Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 385.47%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 47.48%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** 332.6
*   **Relative Divergence:** 94.9

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) demonstrates explosive growth, particularly in the most recent period (2023-2025). This indicates an accelerating growth trajectory for IONQ.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is high, reflecting the stock's volatility. This is expected for a growth stock in a nascent industry like quantum computing.
*   **Alpha:** The high Alpha values suggest significant outperformance relative to the market, not explained by market movements.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to 0 suggest that IONQ's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market. This could be due to the niche nature of the quantum computing industry.
*   **Cap(B):** This metric is not standard in financial analysis. Please provide more context.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Negative Sentiment:**
    *   "IONQ Stock Sinks As Market Gains: Here's Why" (Zacks)
    *   "Quantum Stocks Look Like They’re Forming a Market Bubble. Watch Out." (Barrons.com)
    *   "This ‘Meme Stock ETF’ Is Back. It Could Be a Warning Sign for the Market’s Rally." (Barrons.com)
*   **Positive Sentiment:**
    *   "IONQ Stock Gains on #AQ 64 Score & Expansion Moves: Upside Ahead?" (Zacks)
    *   "What Is One of the Best Quantum Computing Stocks for Growth Investors?" (Motley Fool)
*   **Other:**
    *   "Roundhill Launches Meme Stock ETF (MEME)" (PR Newswire)

**Analysis:** Recent news is mixed.  While some articles highlight positive developments (AQ 64 score, being a good growth stock), others warn of potential risks, including a possible market bubble in quantum stocks and IONQ's recent price decline. The "meme stock ETF" headline is relevant, as it suggests that IONQ may be subject to speculative trading, which can increase volatility.

### 4-2. Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.62 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** $64.62 / $100.00 / $32.00

**Analysis:**  The analyst consensus is "Buy," but the average target price ($64.62) is *below* the current price of $74.30. This suggests that analysts, on average, believe the stock is currently overvalued. The wide range in target prices ($32 to $100) reflects the uncertainty surrounding the future of quantum computing and IONQ's prospects.

| 2025-08-06 | -0.18 | 0.01 B$    |

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS:** Earnings Per Share (EPS) is negative, indicating that the company is not yet profitable. The EPS was particularly low in the latest quarter (2025-08-06).
*   **Revenue:** Revenue is consistently around $0.01-$0.02 billion per quarter. While growing, it is still relatively small.

This reinforces the idea that IONQ is a growth company where profitability is secondary to growth, for now.
