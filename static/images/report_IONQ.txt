**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:**
    *   Key: Buy
    *   Mean Rating: 1.58 (Buy)
    *   Opinions: 13

*   **Analysis:** The consensus among analysts is to "Buy" IONQ, with a mean rating indicating a positive outlook. The average target price of $74.89 suggests significant upside potential from the current price of $46.00. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates some uncertainty among analysts regarding the stock's future performance. The absence of recent rating changes could suggest stability in analyst sentiment, but it's best to find the direction of these ratings.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |

**Capital and Profitability**

|------------|---------|----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $2.27B  | -46.41%  |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.16B  | -15.22%  |

| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B  | -12.05%  |

*   **Analysis:** Equity has increased significantly, indicating that the company has raised capital. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is significantly negative, meaning the company is losing money relative to the shareholder equity invested. It has become even worse over time (the most negative in 2025-09-30).

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Summary:**
    *   IONQ has demonstrated substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with very high volatility.
    *   Recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, with the price falling below key moving averages.
    *   Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The MRI is high, indicating investor confidence, but the RSI suggests a potential for further downside.
    *   News headlines are mixed, highlighting both the company's potential and the challenges it faces.
    *   Analyst consensus is "Buy," with a significant upside potential.
    *   Earnings and ROE are negative, a major concern, even if it is a growth company. It is imperative to investigate where these resources are used.
    *   Revenue is growing, but the company needs to achieve profitability to sustain long-term growth.

*   **Overall Conclusion:** IONQ presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The company has demonstrated significant growth potential, but it is not yet profitable. Given the recent stock price decline, it could present a buying opportunity for investors with a long-term perspective and a high tolerance for risk. A more in-depth look into the company and its financials would be prudent before making any decision.
