Okay, here's a comprehensive report on IONQ, incorporating the data you provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** IONQ
*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company developing trapped ion quantum computers.
*   **Cumulative Return (IONQ):** 298.78%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 49.79%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 250.3
    *   Relative Divergence: 66.4

**Analysis:**

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3%  | 83.0%   | -0.0  | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 82.3%  | 188.0%  | -0.0  | 14.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 305.0% | 79.6%  | 239.0%  | 0.0   | 17.5   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  IONQ exhibits very high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) across all periods, especially the most recent 2023-2025 period.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is substantial, indicating high volatility and risk. This means the stock price can experience significant declines.
*   **Alpha:**  The high Alpha values suggest IONQ's performance is largely independent of the market. It is generating significant returns above what would be expected based on market movements alone.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values close to 0 indicate that IONQ's price is not highly correlated with the S&P 500. It is not moving in tandem with the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market Cap has increased significantly over the periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close Price:** 49.30
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 49.30
    *   Previous Close: 46.90
    *   Change: 5.12
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 46.34
    *   20-day SMA: 50.84
    *   60-day SMA: 59.66

**Analysis:**

*   The recent price increase (change of 5.12) shows positive momentum.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This indicates a potential downtrend, especially in the short term. However, the recent price increase *might* be the start of a reversal.

**3) RSI, PPO, Hybrid Signal, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 35.44
*   **PPO:** 0.18
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4081 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.6 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 37.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the high volatility, the MRI suggests that investment is "High Investment Recommended".  This likely reflects a view of long-term potential.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 35.44 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating upward momentum, although the value (0.18) is not extremely high.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying. The classification of "Very Safe" is interesting given the overall volatility and is likely tied to the MRI score.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:**  The high expected return (37.7%) is a significant factor. This suggests that despite the risks, analysts anticipate substantial long-term growth.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:**  The news headlines present a mixed picture. Some articles are positive ("Is IonQ Stock a Buy?", "AI Analyst Boosts Price Targets"), while others are cautious ("Quantum Computing Investors Need to Wake Up!," "Down 45%, Should You Buy the Dip on IonQ?").
*   **Valuation Concerns:** Several articles discuss valuation, questioning whether IONQ is trading at a premium.
*   **Bubble Warning:**  One article references a broader market bubble, which could impact IONQ.

*   **Equity:**  Equity has increased substantially, likely due to fundraising activities.
*   **ROE:**  The negative Return on Equity (ROE) values reflect the company's current lack of profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock in the quantum computing sector.

*   **Strengths:**  Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, high expected future returns, strong revenue growth, positive analyst ratings, and a potential breakthrough technology in a rapidly evolving field.
*   **Weaknesses:**  High volatility, substantial maximum drawdown, negative earnings and ROE, concerns about valuation, and sensitivity to overall market conditions (especially given the "bubble" warnings).
*   **Outlook:**  IONQ presents a speculative investment opportunity. While there is significant upside potential if the company executes its long-term strategy and the quantum computing sector matures, there are also substantial risks. The "High Investment Recommended" MRI needs to be carefully weighed against the significant financial losses reported and the mixed news sentiment.

**In summary:**  IONQ is not for the faint of heart. It's a high-reward, high-risk play with significant potential but also considerable uncertainty. Careful due diligence and risk management are crucial before investing.
