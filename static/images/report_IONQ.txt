IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. However, the company is not yet profitable and exhibits high volatility. Recent news suggests significant activity and potential developments. The hybrid signal recommends a cautious approach. While the long-term expected return is high, the negative ROE and recent underperformance should be carefully considered.
