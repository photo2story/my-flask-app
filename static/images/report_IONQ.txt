2025-12-22 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided data for IONQ, presented in a clear and concise manner.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **IONQ Inc Overview:** IONQ Inc is a company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.
*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 287.40%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 48.75%
*   **Divergence:** 238.6 (Relative Divergence: 63.6)

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period for which data is available. The substantial positive divergence indicates IONQ's strong performance relative to the broader market. However, the relative divergence of 63.6 suggests that while outperforming, IONQ's current divergence isn't at its absolute peak historically.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%   | 82.3%   | 83.0%   | -0.0    | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0%  | 82.3%   | 188.0%  | -0.0    | 14.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 294.0%  | 79.6%   | 229.0%  | 0.0     | 17.2   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** IONQ exhibits very high Compound Annual Growth Rates, increasing over time.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is substantial, indicating high volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Very high alpha values demonstrate significant outperformance compared to the benchmark (S&P 500). This shows that IONQ's returns are not simply due to market movement but rather company-specific factors.
*   **Beta:** Beta is near 0, suggesting IONQ's price is largely independent of broader market movements. However, a beta of exactly 0 is practically impossible, so this likely implies very low correlation.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization is growing, reflecting investor confidence and the company's growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 48.48
*   **Previous Close:** 46.44
*   **Change:** 4.39
*   **5-day SMA:** 47.30
*   **20-day SMA:** 49.08
*   **60-day SMA:** 57.37

**Analysis:** The current price shows an increase compared to the previous close. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This *could* suggest a potential downtrend or consolidation in the short-term, as the shorter-term moving averages are below the longer-term ones. The recent price increase is a sharp rebound.

**3) Indicators Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 52.36 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0493 (Slightly bearish - suggesting the short-term moving average is below the long-term)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (21 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -3.6 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 42.3% (Compared to S&P 500 over 2+ years)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, indicating moderate risk.
*   The RSI is relatively neutral.
*   The slightly negative PPO suggests a possible weakening of the recent uptrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends a full investment strategy, indicating a bullish outlook from that particular model. It's important to note the higher MRI (0.9) associated with the signal, suggesting a confident but not excessively aggressive stance.
*   The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent short-term decline.
*   The high Expected Return suggests significant potential upside if held long-term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines are overwhelmingly positive, focusing on IONQ's potential for growth in the quantum computing and AI space, and comparing it favorably to competitors like Rigetti and D-Wave. The target price of $100 in 2026 is mentioned, indicating strong expectations.
*   **Key Themes:** Expansion of QuantumBasel deal, comparisons to competitors (Rigetti), potential for growth in 2026, speculation on reaching $100 target.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (1.58 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Target Price:** Average $74.89, High $100, Low $47.00

Its strong technological focus and analyst support are positive factors, but investors should be aware of the current lack of profitability and the stock's volatility. The recent sharp rebound following a short-term decline highlights this volatility. The news indicates considerable speculation and enthusiasm, which can drive short-term price movements but needs to be grounded in solid financial performance long-term.
