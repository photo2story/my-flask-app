**0) Report Structure:**

We'll present the raw data first, then follow with analysis and interpretation.

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **Ticker:** IONQ
*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company.
*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 258.53%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 49.17%
*   **Divergence:** 209.4 (Relative Divergence: 56.6)

**Analysis:**

*   IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return.  The 258.53% return compared to the S&P 500's 49.17% demonstrates substantial outperformance.
*   The Divergence of 209.4, with a relative divergence of 56.6 indicates IONQ's outperformance is currently in the middle ground compared to its historical highs and lows against the S&P 500. This suggests that while the outperformance is significant, it's not at its peak relative to its own past performance.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 9.0%    | 90.9% | -19.0%   | 2.4   | 4.4    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** CAGR is increasing dramatically, showing accelerating growth from 9% to 911%.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** MDD is consistently high (above 87%), suggesting significant volatility and risk of substantial losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is strongly positive and increasing (from -19% to 843%), indicating that IONQ is generating returns above what would be expected based on market risk. This high alpha suggests strong stock-specific performance.

*   The negative PPO indicates a downward trend in momentum.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" is strongly bullish, recommending to invest 100% cash in the stock.
*   The recent decline in relative divergence (-12.0) confirms the short-term downward trend.
*   The high Expected Return (210.11%) suggests that, despite recent volatility, there's potential for significant long-term gains.

| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B  | -12.05%   |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue is growing quarter-over-quarter, which is positive. Profit margins are reasonably high (above 40%), indicating that the company can generate profits from its revenue streams.
*   Equity is increasing, showing that the company's assets are growing.
*   However, Return on Equity (ROE) is negative and volatile, reflecting the company's lack of profitability. The recent sharp drop in ROE to -46.41% is concerning.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Strong Outperformance, High Volatility:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but with very high volatility (high Beta and MDD). This suggests it's a high-risk, high-reward investment.
*   **Downward Trend:** Recent price action and technical indicators (moving averages, negative PPO, short-term divergence) point to a downward trend.
*   **Unprofitable, but Growing:** The company is currently unprofitable (negative EPS and ROE), but revenue is growing, and profit margins are decent. This suggests potential for future profitability as the company scales. The recent EPS decline is concerning, signaling that costs are outpacing revenue growth.
*   **Analyst Optimism, but Uncertainty:** Analysts generally have optimistic price targets, but the wide range suggests considerable uncertainty.
*   **Mixed News:** News coverage is mixed, highlighting long-term potential while also raising concerns about recent price drops.
*   **Conclusion:** IONQ presents a speculative investment opportunity. It has high growth potential in the quantum computing sector, but it also carries significant risk due to its high volatility and current lack of profitability. The recent downward trend warrants caution. Investors should carefully weigh their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing. The very high growth rate of the sector needs to be considered vs the fact that the company is still losing a lot of money. If growth is not sufficient, it will be hard for the stock to justify its price.
