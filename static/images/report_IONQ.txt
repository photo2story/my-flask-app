The positive change in relative divergence confirms short-term upward momentum. The expected return of 11.6% over the S&P 500 is attractive for long-term investors. The fact that the current market price decreased relative to its previous day's close means it is a signal of possible volatility.

**Analysis:** Revenue is consistently at $0.01B across all quarters. Profit margins are healthy, ranging from approximately 43% to 57%. However, Return on Equity (ROE) is negative for all quarters, which is consistent with the negative EPS and suggests that the company is not yet generating profits from its equity. The substantial increase in Equity from $0.38B to $0.77B between 2024-12-31 and 2025-03-31 indicates a significant capital influx, possibly through equity financing.

**7. Overall Analysis and Summary**
