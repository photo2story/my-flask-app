*   **Sector-Specific Risks:** Quantum computing is a nascent field, and IONQ faces competition and technological uncertainties.

**Recommendation:**

While IONQ presents a compelling growth story, investors should exercise caution due to the high valuation, overbought conditions, and ongoing losses. Given the RSI indicator of 91.07354185424803, it is better to wait for a price correction before considering to buy. A small position may be warranted for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon, but thorough due diligence and continuous monitoring of the company's progress are essential.
