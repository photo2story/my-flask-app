**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company is currently unprofitable, with consistent negative EPS and low revenue.  While revenue has been relatively stable, the lack of profitability is a significant concern.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows stable revenue but negative ROE (Return on Equity).  While the profit margin appears healthy at times, the negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  This is a major cause for concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ shows exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this performance is accompanied by high volatility and consistent unprofitability.  The high beta indicates significant market risk. While the projected long-term return is positive,  the negative ROE and consistently negative EPS raise serious concerns about the company's financial sustainability.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high returns against the substantial risk involved before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the company's future prospects and its path to profitability is crucial.
