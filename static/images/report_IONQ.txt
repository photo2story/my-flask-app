2025-12-17 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of IONQ based on the provided data, broken down as requested.

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a company that develops trapped ion quantum computers.

*   **Return Rate Numbers:**
    *   IONQ Cumulative Return: 299.95%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 47.67%
    *   Divergence (from VOO): Current: 219.9, Relative Divergence: 59.1

*   **Return Rate Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating substantial growth since its inception. However, the high relative divergence of 59.1 suggests that while currently positive, it's not at the very peak of its historical divergence range.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis Numbers:**

    | Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
    | 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3% | 83.0%  | -0.0 | 4.4   |
    | 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 82.3% | 188.0% | -0.0 | 14.8  |
    | 2023-2025  | 307.0% | 79.6% | 242.0% | 0.0  | 17.6  |

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows remarkable growth, accelerating from 84% to over 300% over the periods analyzed.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large drops in price.
    *   **Alpha:**  The high Alpha values suggest that IONQ's returns are primarily due to factors specific to the company rather than just market movements.  A high Alpha implies that the investment generates more returns than predicted by its beta.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values close to zero indicate that IONQ's price movements are not strongly correlated with the S&P 500.
    *   **Cap(B):** The Market Cap in Billions has increased significantly, reflecting the company's growth in valuation.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Price Numbers:**
    *   Current Close: 49.67
    *   Previous Close: 46.07
    *   Change: 7.81
    *   5-day SMA: 50.072
    *   20-day SMA: 48.9545
    *   60-day SMA: 58.679

*   **Price Fluctuation Analysis:** The stock price experienced a significant positive change (7.81) in the most recent trading session. The 5-day SMA is slightly above the 20-day SMA, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  However, both are significantly below the 60-day SMA, indicating a potential longer-term downtrend or a recent correction from a higher price level.  The large positive change suggests a sharp rebound.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **Indicator Numbers:**
    *   MRI: 0.7 (Medium Investment)
    *   RSI: 54.29
    *   PPO: 0.6958
    *   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (21 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
    *   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -15.6 (short-term decline)
    *   Expected Return: 48.3%

*   **Indicator Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A Market Risk Indicator of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 54.29 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests a possible upward trend but requires further confirmation.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal, recommending 100% investment, suggests a strong buy signal based on a "Very Safe" assessment and high MRI of 0.90. However, it is important to consider that the MRI value reported here differs from the MRI above (0.7).
    *   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days indicates a short-term decline in performance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 48.3% is very high, suggesting significant potential upside if held long-term (over 2 years).

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Headlines:**

    *   **Insider Sales:**  News of insider sales has negatively impacted the stock price. This creates a perception of lowered confidence within the company itself.
    *   **Canada Quantum Funding:** Canada's investment in quantum computing is a positive sign for the sector but may dilute focus on IonQ specifically.
    *   **Jefferies Buy Rating:**  Jefferies initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a $100 price target, providing a positive catalyst after the insider sales news. This suggests that at least one analyst firm views the company favorably despite recent negative press.
    *   **"Nvidia of Quantum" but Volatile:**  The "Nvidia of Quantum" comparison is flattering but the news also warns of dilution and high valuation. This highlights both the potential and the risks.

*   **News Analysis:** Recent news is mixed. Insider sales and concerns about dilution are negative, while a Buy rating from Jefferies provides a positive counterpoint.  The association with "Nvidia of Quantum" can boost investor sentiment, but the warning about volatility and valuation is important to consider.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:**
    *   Rating: Buy (~1.70)
    *   Number of Opinions: 11
    *   Target Price: $73.96 (Avg), $100 (High), $47 (Low)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**
  • [0] :  →  ()
  • [1] :  →  ()
  • [2] :  →  ()
  • [3] :  →  ()

*   **Analyst Analysis:** The consensus rating of "Buy" and a relatively high average target price of $73.96 suggest that analysts generally have a positive outlook on IonQ. The wide range between the high and low target prices ($47-$100) indicates significant disagreement and uncertainty about the company's future valuation. Absence of Rating Changes is not enough information.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | -3.58 | 0.04 B$   |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.7  | 0.02 B$   |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.14 | 0.01 B$   |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24 | 0.01 B$   |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.24 | 0.01 B$   |

*   **Earnings Analysis:** The data shows consistent revenue growth (0.01B -> 0.02B -> 0.04B) but also significant losses per share (EPS). The EPS is very negative, particularly in the most recent quarter (-3.58), despite increased revenue. It is important to understand why the revenue increase is not translating into improved profitability. The final two rows are the same.

**6) Financial Information**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.04B  | 46.69%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.02B  | 59.76%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.01B  | 42.97%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B  | 56.92%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B  | 47.46%        |

*   **Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE       |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $2.27B  | -46.41%   |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.16B  | -15.22%   |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.77B  | -4.22%    |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B  | -52.62%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B  | -12.05%   |

*   **Financial Analysis:** Revenue has increased steadily, and the profit margins are relatively high (around 40-60%). However, the company is not profitable, as evidenced by the negative Return on Equity (ROE). The significant increase in equity over the period is likely due to capital raises (e.g., stock offerings), which are common for growth companies. The negative ROE despite high profit margins suggests that the operating expenses are high. The significant revenue increase in the last quarter has not improved the company's ROE or EPS.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Overall:** IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk company in the emerging quantum computing sector.
*   **Potential:**  It has shown exceptional return rates and boasts a substantial alpha, indicating company-specific drivers of growth. Analyst consensus is generally positive, and the company is gaining traction in its sector.
*   **Risks:** The company faces significant risks, including high volatility (MDD), negative earnings and ROE, and sensitivity to news events like insider sales. Dilution through future stock offerings is also a concern. The company's price movement is not strongly correlated with the overall market, making it a potentially diversifying investment but also one that is less predictable based on market trends.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** The MRI suggests a Medium Investment, but this should be qualified. The Hybrid Signal is quite high and should be interpreted with caution given other negative indicators. An investment in IONQ requires a high-risk tolerance and a long-term perspective. Investors should carefully weigh the potential upside against the considerable risks before investing. It's important to monitor the company's progress towards profitability and its ability to manage dilution.
