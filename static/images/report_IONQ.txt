## IONQ Inc. (IONQ) Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

IONQ Inc. is a company focused on developing and commercializing trapped-ion quantum computers.  Its stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. However, recent price action shows a decline, and profitability remains a concern.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 193.81%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 9.46%
* **Return Difference:** 184.4%  (This signifies IONQ's substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 67.2% (This means IONQ's outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is in the upper 67th percentile of its historical range.)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0% | 72.8% | 73.0% | 0.2 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 199.0% | 72.8% | 180.0% | 0.0 |  |
| 2023-2025  | 195.0% | 67.0% | 188.0% | 0.4 |  |


The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significantly positive Alpha values indicate substantial outperformance against the market benchmark. The fluctuating Beta values suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements, especially in 2022-2024.  The lack of capitalization data ('Cap(B)') makes it hard to judge the market impact. High Alpha values suggest the stock's outperformance is not just due to market movement but intrinsic factors. The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates significant risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $26.37
* **Last Market Price:** $25.42 (-3.62% change)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $22.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $23.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $30.41

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend. The recent drop of -3.62% points to a short-term decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4271 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 60.45 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 1.889 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 24.4% (over two years relative to S&P 500)

The indicators suggest a mixed picture. While the PPO and relative divergence show positive momentum, the RSI is not strongly bullish. The significant negative price change of -3.62% should be considered and might indicate a short-term correction. The high expected return remains positive despite this short-term downturn.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.24 | $0.01B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -$0.18 | $0.01B      |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.19 | $0.01B      |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.22 | $0.01B      |
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.22 | $0.01B      |

Consistent negative EPS indicates the company is not yet profitable.  Revenue remains flat at around $0.01B. This is a major concern for long-term investors.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B | 56.92%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B | 47.46%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.01B | 50.59%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.01B | 54.97%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.01B | 48.20%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE     |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B | -52.62% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B | -12.05% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B | -8.11%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B | -8.25%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.48B | -8.64%  |

While profit margins appear relatively high, the consistently negative ROE (Return on Equity) is alarming.  This suggests that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital despite apparent profit margins.  This requires further investigation into the company's financial statements to understand the reasons behind this.  The high reported profit margins in the context of negative ROE needs deeper investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ has demonstrated exceptional growth compared to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by high volatility and significant risk (high MDD, fluctuating Beta).  The company's current financial situation is concerning, however, due to consistent negative EPS and ROE despite reasonable profit margins. While the expected long-term return is positive, the current lack of profitability and the recent price decline raise serious concerns.  Further investigation into the company's financial health and future prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high positive alpha values and large return difference to S&P500 suggests there's a market perception of long term future success, but this is not yet reflected in the company's current financials.  Investors should carefully weigh the high growth potential against the significant risks involved.
