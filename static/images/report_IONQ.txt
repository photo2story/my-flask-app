2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the analysis of IONQ stock.

**Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.

**1) Return Comparison (IONQ vs. S&P 500)**

*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 269.3%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 45.3%
*   **Divergence:** 224.0 (Relative Divergence: 59.5)

**Analysis:**

*   IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The cumulative return is substantially higher.
*   The divergence of 224.0 indicates a considerable performance gap between IONQ and the S&P 500.
*   The relative divergence of 59.5 suggests that while the outperformance is significant, there is room for further gains based on historical fluctuations (it's in the middle range of its past divergence).
*   The Alpha and Beta analysis further supports IONQ's performance, showing high alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and beta greater than 1 (higher volatility than the market). The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) also demonstrates impressive growth over the analyzed periods, but this comes with significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicating high risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Indicates how much better (or worse) the investment performed compared to its benchmark index.
    *   **Beta:** Measures a stock's volatility compared to the overall market.
    *   **Cap:** Measures a stock's market capitalization (outstanding shares multiplied by share price), expressed in billions of dollars.
    *   **CAGR:** Compound Annual Growth Rate is the annual rate of return that would be required for an investment to grow from its initial to its final value, assuming the profits were reinvested at the end of each year of the investment's lifespan.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown measures the largest decline from a peak to a trough during a specific period for an investment.
