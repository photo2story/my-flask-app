**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

IONQ Inc. is a company focused on developing and commercializing trapped-ion quantum computers.

IONQ significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return difference of 170.3% and the high relative divergence highlight this substantial outperformance. However, the relative divergence suggests that this level of outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical volatility.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0% | 72.8% | 73.0% | 0.2 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 199.0% | 72.8% | 180.0% | 0.0 |  |
| 2023-2025  | 185.0% | 67.0% | 173.0% | 0.4 |  |

**Analysis:** The high CAGR values across all periods indicate strong growth. However, the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggests significant volatility and risk.  The Alpha values, particularly in the first two periods, are exceptionally high, indicating substantial outperformance relative to the benchmark.  The fluctuating Beta values show varying sensitivities to market movements.  Missing capitalization data limits a complete financial assessment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $25.40
* **5-day Moving Average:** $25.82 (Slightly below)
* **20-day Moving Average:** $23.85 (Above)
* **60-day Moving Average:** $29.63 (Significantly below)

The price is currently below its 5 and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend, while being above the 20-day moving average, indicating some recent recovery. The recent price change of $0.20 indicates a small positive movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 51.49 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 2.50 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +11.4% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 28.2% (Over 2 years, compared to S&P 500)

The indicators paint a mixed picture. While the MRI suggests moderate risk, the positive PPO and upward trend in relative divergence support a bullish outlook.  The high expected return is attractive, but it's crucial to remember that this is a projection and involves inherent uncertainties.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |

| 2024-11-06 | -$0.22 | $0.01 B     |

**Analysis:**  The company is consistently reporting negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses. Revenue remains relatively flat at around $0.01 billion. This suggests that despite strong stock performance, the company is not yet profitable. Further investigation into operational expenses and growth strategies is warranted.

| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B | -8.25%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.48B | -8.64%  |

**Analysis:** Despite relatively high profit margins, the company's negative ROE consistently indicates that it is not generating returns on its equity. This, coupled with negative EPS, raises serious concerns about the company's long-term financial viability.  The fluctuating profit margins need further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ's stock performance has been exceptionally strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this strong performance is not reflected in the company's fundamentals.  The company consistently reports losses, and its ROE remains negative.  While the high growth rate is promising, the substantial volatility and lack of profitability represent significant risks.  Investors should carefully weigh the high potential reward against the substantial risk associated with this early-stage company in a rapidly evolving technology sector.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of operational expenses and future growth prospects, is essential before making any investment decisions.
