Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of IONQ based on the provided data, broken down into the requested sections:

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** IONQ
*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company focusing on developing trapped ion quantum computers.
*   **Cumulative Return (IONQ):** 302.34%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 48.53%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current:** 265.9
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 69.4 (Meaning the current divergence is 69.4% of the way between the minimum and maximum divergence observed).

**Analysis:**

IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined. The cumulative return is over six times that of the S&P 500.  The relative divergence of 69.4% suggests that while the stock has performed strongly, it's not at its absolute peak divergence compared to its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Analysis:**

|            | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock in the quantum computing industry. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but also exhibits high volatility and a substantial maximum drawdown. Analyst sentiment is generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus and significant upside potential based on target prices. However, the company is currently unprofitable, relying on revenue growth and equity raises. The news sentiment is mixed, highlighting both the potential for exponential growth (like Nvidia) and the risks associated with the stock's valuation and potential dilution. The technical indicators suggest that the stock is slightly overbought and might experience a pullback in the short term. Overall, IONQ appears to be a speculative investment with high potential reward but also significant risk. Investors should be prepared for volatility and have a long-term investment horizon.
