    **Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|---------|--------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 100.0%  | 83.0%  | 2.4  | 4.4    |

| 2023-2025  | 265.0% | 99.7%  | 203.0% | 2.8  | 15.9   |

**Analysis:**

*   IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, with a cumulative return far exceeding VOO's. The divergence of 209.4 highlights this outperformance. However, the relative divergence of 56.6 suggests that while the stock has performed well, its current divergence from VOO is only at the 56.6th percentile, indicating that there's room for further upside based on past performance.
*   The Alpha, Beta analysis shows strong Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) but high Beta (volatility relative to the market). The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values indicates significant risk in investing in IONQ. Increasing Capital (Cap(B)) reflects growing investor interest.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.04B    | 46.69%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.02B    | 59.76%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.01B    | 42.97%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.01B    | 56.92%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.01B    | 47.46%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE         |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $2.27B    | -46.41%      |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.16B    | -15.22%      |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.44B    | -12.05%      |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue is increasing, but ROE is negative, meaning the company is not generating profits from its equity. Equity is increasing, likely due to fundraising activities. The revenue growth and high profit margins are promising, but the negative ROE is a major concern.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

IONQ presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.

*   **Strengths:** Strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500, high expected return, increasing revenue, significant deals (e.g., South Korea), optimistic analyst target prices, and a high MRI suggesting investment is recommended.
*   **Weaknesses:** High volatility (Beta), negative EPS and ROE, recent price decline, and conflicting signals between the high MRI and other momentum indicators (RSI, PPO). The increasing EPS losses is a concern.

**Conclusion:**

IONQ is a speculative investment in the quantum computing sector. While it has shown significant potential and growth, it is not yet profitable and carries substantial risk. The recent price decline and conflicting signals warrant caution. Long-term investors who believe in the potential of quantum computing and are willing to tolerate high volatility may find IONQ attractive. However, a thorough understanding of the company's financials and the risks involved is crucial before investing. The fact that analysts predict substantial upside suggests the market is pricing in future growth. But, the negative earnings and ROE cannot be ignored.
