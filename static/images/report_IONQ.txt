Equity has increased substantially, indicating capital raises or other financing activities.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk quantum computing company.

*   **Potential:** Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 and strong analyst consensus suggest substantial upside potential. Very high CAGR and expected return (52.2%). The Market Risk Indicator supports high investment recommendation.
*   **Risks:** Recent negative price action (below moving averages), negative short-term divergence change, and news articles highlighting stock drops suggest short-term volatility. The negative EPS and ROE highlight the company's current lack of profitability. High MDD and an uncorrelated beta further highlights risk.
*   **Financials:** Revenue is growing, and profit margins are strong, but the company is currently unprofitable, requiring reliance on capital. Equity is increasing.
*   **Recommendation:** IONQ appears to be a speculative investment suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. The potential for significant returns is there, but investors should be prepared for volatility and the possibility of further short-term price declines. It would be prudent to monitor earnings and news flow closely.
