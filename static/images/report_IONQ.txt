Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of IONQ based on the provided data.

**0) Report Introduction**

This report provides an analysis of IONQ Inc. (IONQ), a company focused on quantum computing, comparing its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) and analyzing recent market data, news, analyst opinions, and financial information.

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **IONQ Inc.** (IONQ) is a quantum computing company focused on building trapped ion quantum computers.
*   **Cumulative Return (IONQ):** 275.02%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 48.45%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 249.0
    *   Relative Divergence: 66.0

**Analysis:**

IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return.  The divergence of 249 indicates a substantial difference in performance. The relative divergence of 66.0 suggests that the current divergence is in the upper-middle range of its historical fluctuation.

**Alpha, Beta & Other Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%   | 82.3%   | 83.0%   | -0.0    | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0%  | 82.3%   | 188.0%  | -0.0    | 14.7   |
| 2023-2025  | 282.0%  | 79.6%   | 217.0%  | 0.0     | 16.6   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR shows substantial growth acceleration year-over-year, reflecting the high-growth nature of the quantum computing sector and IONQ's potential.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD figures (around 80%) indicate significant volatility and risk associated with the stock. Be cautious, this is a volatile stock.
*   **Alpha:** The consistently high alpha values suggest that IONQ's returns are exceeding what would be expected based on the market (S&P 500) alone. IONQ is generating returns independently of broader market movements.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values hovering around 0 indicate very low correlation with the S&P 500. This suggests that IONQ's price movements are largely independent of the overall market, further supporting the high-alpha observation.
*   **Cap (B):** The market capitalization is steadily growing, reflecting increasing investor confidence and valuation.

*   **20-day SMA:** 49.4991
*   **60-day SMA:** 59.8487

**Analysis:**

IONQ's current price is below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).  This indicates a short-term downward trend. The fact that the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, further reinforces this downward trend.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 38.20
*   **PPO:** 0.56
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (21 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.1 (Indicates a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 38.3%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation.
*   The RSI of 38.20 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), suggesting a potential buying opportunity.
*   The PPO of 0.56 indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which is considered a bullish signal, although it's very close to zero.
*   The hybrid signal is bullish as the MRI is high and there is a high recommendation, meaning that all cash should be invested at the present moment, and reinvested again monthly.
*   The recent decline in relative divergence supports the recent downward price trend.
*   The expected return of 38.3% is very high, suggesting significant potential upside if held for the long term.
