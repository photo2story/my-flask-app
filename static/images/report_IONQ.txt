2025-12-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive report analyzing IONQ, based on the data provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company.
*   **Cumulative Return:** IONQ's cumulative return is 288.84%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 49.15%.
*   **Divergence:** The divergence between IONQ and the S&P 500 is currently at 249.0. The relative divergence of 66.0 suggests that the current divergence is positioned in the middle of its historical range, meaning it's not at either extreme relative to past fluctuations.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3% | 83.0%  | -0.0  | 4.7    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 82.3% | 188.0% | -0.0 | 15.9   |
| 2023-2025  | 295.0% | 79.6% | 230.0% | 0.0   | 18.5   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** IONQ shows extremely high growth rates over the analyzed periods. The CAGR increases significantly from the 2021-2023 period to the 2023-2025 period. This indicates accelerating growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is relatively high, indicating significant volatility and risk. This is common for growth stocks, especially in emerging technology sectors like quantum computing. However, the MDD is gradually decreasing, showing improved stability.
*   **Alpha:** The high Alpha values indicate that IONQ has significantly outperformed its expected return based on its beta, suggesting that the stock has generated substantial excess returns relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** A Beta close to 0 indicates IONQ's price is theoretically uncorrelated to the S&P 500. In reality, some correlation is probable, and this could represent a non-linear relationship.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** The company's capitalization has increased substantially across the periods, reflecting market confidence and growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** $48.66
*   **Last Market Data:** Price $52.28, Previous Close $54.76, Change: -$4.53 (a decrease)

    *   5-day SMA: $47.76
    *   20-day SMA: $49.26
    *   60-day SMA: $59.93

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term downtrend.
*   The 5-day SMA being below the 20-day SMA reinforces this short-term bearish signal.
*   The 60-day SMA is significantly higher than the shorter-term SMAs, indicating that while there's been a recent pullback, the longer-term trend has been positive.
*   The last market data confirms a recent price decline.

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -0.1 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 38.3% (over 2 years, compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI indicates neutral momentum.
*   A positive PPO suggests upward price momentum but it's important to consider that recent divergence change is showing a short-term decline.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a buying opportunity based on its risk assessment.
*   The expected return of 38.3% is very attractive, suggesting the potential for significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.
