**1) Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

IONQ Inc. is a company focused on developing and commercializing trapped-ion quantum computers.  Compared to the S&P 500 (represented by VOO), IONQ has significantly outperformed the market over the analyzed period.  The substantial cumulative return difference highlights this outperformance. However, the high relative return difference also suggests that this level of outperformance compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 is relatively high.  The provided Alpha and Beta values illustrate a high beta (indicating high volatility and correlation with the market), with varying alpha (which measures excess returns compared to the benchmark) across different periods.  High beta indicates higher risk.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2022-2024  | 199.0% | 72.8% | 178.0% | 10.0 |  |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $25.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $23.92

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent price drop of -3.27% is noteworthy.

* **RSI:** 52.32 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

The recent price drop is significant, but the positive PPO and slightly above-neutral RSI suggest that the downward trend might be temporary.  The high expected return indicates potential for long-term growth exceeding the S&P 500's returns, despite the current volatility.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company is currently reporting losses.  Revenue remains relatively stable, but the consistent negative EPS is a significant concern.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

IONQ has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500, but this needs to be considered in the context of its high volatility (high beta).  The consistently negative EPS and ROE are major red flags, indicating underlying financial weakness despite positive short-term price movement.  The high projected long-term return is promising, but investors need to carefully weigh the potential for high growth against the substantial financial risks associated with negative profitability and high volatility. Further investigation into the company's future growth prospects and its plan to achieve profitability is crucial before making any investment decisions. The current downward trend in price should also be carefully monitored.
