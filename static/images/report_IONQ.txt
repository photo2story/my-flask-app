    | 2023-2025  | 323.0%  | 79.6% | 256.0%  | 0.0    | 17.8   |

**Analysis:** IONQ has a very high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over the periods shown. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is also high, indicating significant volatility. The high Alpha suggests that IONQ's returns are largely independent of market movements (S&P 500) and more attributable to company-specific factors.

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below the 5-day and 60-day SMAs but above the 20-day SMA. The negative change in the last market indicates a recent downward trend. The fact that the 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA suggests a possible short-term upward trend (although the recent price drop complicates this). The 60-day SMA is much higher, indicating the price is still significantly lower than its recent highs.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| :--------- | :------ | :------------ |
| 2025-09-30 | \$0.04B | 46.69%        |

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE       |
| :--------- | :------ | :-------- |
| 2025-09-30 | \$2.27B | -46.41%   |
| 2025-06-30 | \$1.16B | -15.22%   |

| 2024-09-30 | \$0.44B | -12.05%   |

**Analysis:** Revenue is growing steadily, and profit margins are high, which is positive. However, the ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating profits from its equity base. The increasing equity base suggests the company is raising capital, likely through equity offerings, to fund its growth.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

IONQ presents a mixed picture.

**Positives:**

*   **Significant Outperformance:** Has significantly outperformed the S\&P 500.
*   **High Growth Potential:** The quantum computing sector is a high-growth area, and IONQ is positioned as a leader in the field.
*   **Bullish Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts have a generally positive outlook on the stock with high price targets.
*   **Positive News Flow:** Recent news focuses on the long-term potential of the company.
*   **Increasing Revenue and High Profit Margins:** Revenue is growing consistently, with solid profit margins.
*   **Strong Buy Recommendation:** Hybrid signal suggests a strong buy.

**Negatives:**

*   **High Volatility:** The high MDD indicates significant price swings.
*   **Unprofitable:** The company is currently unprofitable with widening losses.
*   **Negative ROE:** The negative ROE suggests the company is not generating returns on its equity.
*   **Recent Sharp Decline:** The most recent data point shows a sharp decline in price, indicating immediate volatility.

**Conclusion:**

IONQ is a high-risk, high-reward investment. Its potential for future growth is significant, but it's important to consider its current financial performance and volatility. A long-term investment horizon (2+ years) is likely necessary to realize the potential gains. The recent price decline should be carefully monitored, and the company's progress towards profitability will be a key indicator of its long-term success. The "Buy" recommendation from the Hybrid Signal, as well as general analyst optimism, should not be taken at face value. Investors need to conduct their own due diligence.
