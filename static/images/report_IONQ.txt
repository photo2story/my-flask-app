2025-11-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of IONQ based on the provided data, broken down into sections as requested.

**0) Overview:**

*   **Ticker:** IONQ
*   **Company Name:** IONQ Inc
*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (IONQ vs. S&P 500 (VOO))**

*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 290.64%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 42.66%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 248.0
    *   Relative Divergence: 65.8%

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed. The current divergence is 248.0, meaning IONQ has a substantially higher cumulative return. The relative divergence of 65.8% indicates that this outperformance, while substantial, is not at the absolute peak level seen in the past, considering the historical range of divergence.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3% | 83.0%    | -0.0   | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 82.3% | 188.0%   | -0.0   | 14.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 297.0% | 79.6% | 238.0%   | 0.0    | 14.8   |

**Analysis:**
*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Demonstrates very high growth rates, accelerating over the periods examined.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values indicate significant volatility and risk, as the stock has experienced large declines from peak values.
*   **Alpha:** Very high alpha figures suggest that IONQ has significantly outperformed the market, likely due to factors specific to the company or sector rather than general market trends.
*   **Beta:** Beta values near zero suggest that IONQ's price movements are not highly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This reinforces the idea that IONQ's performance is driven by company-specific factors.
*   **Cap(B):** The capitalization suggests that the company size is 4.4 B$ at the period of 2021-2023 and has increased to 14.8B$ at the period of 2022-2025.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 41.67
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 41.71
    *   Previous Close: 41.00
    *   Change: 1.73
*   **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**
    *   5-day SMA: 45.49
    *   20-day SMA: 53.40
    *   60-day SMA: 59.30

**Analysis:** IONQ's current price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day SMA). This suggests a recent downtrend in the stock price.  The 5-day SMA being the closest to the current price suggests a potential short-term stabilization or bottoming out, but further confirmation would be needed.

**3) Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.52
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash 80% - Sell 80% of holdings (Risky - MRI:0.50)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.8 (Negative – indicating a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 38.2%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of risk, indicating that investment is recommended but should be approached with caution.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 27.52 indicates that IONQ is currently oversold. This *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity, but it can also signal continued downward momentum.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-2.42) reinforces the indication of a short-term downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests selling 80% of holdings and moving to a high cash position (80%). This indicates a bearish outlook based on the algorithm, likely triggered by the perceived risk (MRI: 0.50) and recent price action.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Confirms the short-term negative trend.
*   **Expected Return:**  A high expected return (38.2%) is presented, suggesting substantial potential gains if held long-term. However, this should be weighed against the short-term bearish signals.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

The news headlines suggest a mixed sentiment towards IONQ:

*   **Positive:** "IonQ Stock is on Discount," "Investing in Quantum's Next Wave: IONQ, QBTS, RGTI Positioned to Win," "Will IonQ Be a $1 Trillion Company 10 Years From Now?"
*   **Neutral/Cautious:** "IonQ Stock: Here’s Why J.P. Morgan Is Staying on the Sidelines for Now"
*   **Negative:** "Institutional Investors Piled Into IonQ, Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc. Stocks -- and They'll Likely Regret It", "Quantum Stocks IONQ, RGTI, and QBTS Plunge—Should Investors Buy the Dip?"

**Analysis:** The news is contradictory. Some articles suggest IONQ is a promising investment, while others express caution or concern about recent declines and potential overvaluation. This highlights the speculative nature of the quantum computing sector. The Motley Fool article with a bold prediction should be treated with skepticism as it is very forward-looking and based on many assumptions.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.78 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 10
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 72.35 / 100.00 / 47.00

**Analysis:**  Despite recent price weakness, the analyst consensus remains positive, with a "Buy" rating and a mean rating suggesting near-buy sentiment.  The average target price of $72.35 implies significant upside potential from the current price of $41.67. However, it's important to consider the range of target prices ($47 - $100) as this illustrates that it's not universally expected.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-11-05 | -3.58  | 0.04 B$    |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.7   | 0.02 B$    |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.14  | 0.01 B$    |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24  | 0.01 B$    |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.24  | 0.01 B$    |

**Analysis:** IONQ is currently unprofitable. EPS (Earnings Per Share) is consistently negative. The most recent EPS (-3.58) is significantly worse than previous quarters, which could be a cause for concern. While revenue is increasing, it's not yet sufficient to offset expenses. This is typical for growth companies in emerging sectors, but it reinforces the higher risk profile.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE      |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $2.27B  | -46.41%  |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.16B  | -15.22%  |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.77B  | -4.22%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.38B  | -52.62%  |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.44B  | -12.05%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue is growing quarter over quarter, which is a positive sign.
*   **Profit Margin:** The company achieves high profit margins (42.97% - 59.76%).
*   **Equity:**  Equity has increased significantly, particularly in the most recent quarter. This could be due to fundraising activities.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is consistently negative, reflecting the company's unprofitability. A sharp decline in ROE in the most recent quarter (-46.41%) despite increased equity could be a red flag.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock in the emerging quantum computing sector.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Significant historical outperformance vs. the S&P 500.
    *   Strong revenue growth.
    *   High profit margins.
    *   Positive analyst consensus with significant upside potential (based on target prices).
    *   Increasing equity.
*   **Negatives:**
    *   High volatility (MDD).
    *   Currently unprofitable with negative EPS and ROE.
    *   Recent price downtrend (below SMAs).
    *   Bearish short-term signals from technical indicators (RSI, PPO, Hybrid Signal).
    *   Conflicting news sentiment.
    *   The high negative ROE suggests that the company's investments and operations have not been generating sufficient returns, given the amount of equity invested by shareholders.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   The quantum computing sector is highly speculative, and IONQ's success is not guaranteed.
    *   Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon.
    *   The high expected return should be balanced against the current bearish signals.
    *   Further monitoring of earnings and revenue growth is crucial to assess the company's progress towards profitability.

**Conclusion:**

IONQ presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. While the company has demonstrated strong growth and potential, the current market conditions, technical indicators, and financial performance suggest caution. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing. The recent news and the hybrid signal indicating a sell-off should be taken seriously. A small, speculative position might be appropriate for those with a long-term investment horizon and a high-risk tolerance, but a large investment is not advisable at this time.
