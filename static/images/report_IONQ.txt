Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of IONQ based on the data you provided:

**0) Introduction**

This report analyzes the stock performance, financial health, and future outlook of IONQ Inc., a quantum computing company. We will examine return rates, technical indicators, recent news, analyst opinions, and earnings data to provide a comprehensive overview.

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.

*   **Return Rate Comparison:**
    *   IONQ Cumulative Return: 296.91%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 47.67%
    *   Divergence: 249.2
    *   Relative Divergence: 66.1

*   **Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered. The divergence of 249.2 indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 66.1 suggests that IONQ's outperformance, while significant, is not at the extreme upper end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
    |------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
    | 2021-2023  | 84.0%   | 82.3%   | 83.0%   | -0.0 | 4.4     |
    | 2022-2024  | 208.0%  | 82.3%   | 188.0%  | -0.0 | 14.8    |
    | 2023-2025  | 303.0%  | 79.6%   | 239.0%  | 0.0 | 17.6    |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:**  IONQ's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is exceptionally high, particularly in the 2023-2025 period. This demonstrates rapid growth in its stock value.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is substantial, indicating significant volatility and risk. Investors should be prepared for potential large price swings.
    *   **Alpha:**  The high Alpha figures indicate that IONQ has significantly outperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. This suggests that the stock's performance is not solely due to market movements.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values hovering around 0.0 suggest that the stock has very little to no correlation with the market.
    *   **Cap(B):** The Capital is consistently growing.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close: 49.67
*   Last-market Change: 7.81
*   5-day SMA: 50.062
*   20-day SMA: 48.9421
*   60-day SMA: 58.6609

*   **Analysis:** The stock price closed at 49.67, with a previous close of 46.07 (change of 7.81). The stock is trading slightly below its 5-day moving average (SMA), above its 20-day SMA, and significantly below its 60-day SMA. This suggests a potential short-term pullback, but the price being above the 20-day SMA is still bullish. The large change figure (7.81) is a great fluctuation, and means there is something important going on.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   MRI: 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 54.33
*   PPO: 0.6991
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash
*   Recent 20-day relative divergence change: -8.8 (Short-term decrease)
*   Expected Return: 39.0%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 54.33 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
    *   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.6991 suggests a positive trend, as the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is aggressive; no cash held; all available for buy. This may indicate it's an ideal time to purchase stocks.
    *   **Divergence Change:** The recent decrease in relative divergence suggests a short-term weakening in IONQ's outperformance compared to the S&P 500. This aligns with the idea of a short-term pullback.
    *   **Expected Return:** The 39% expected return is very high. This is a high-risk, high-reward investment.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   Quantum Computing Stocks Potential (Motley Fool)
    *   Canada Quantum Computing Funding Impact (Benzinga)
    *   Jefferies Starts Coverage with $100 Target (ts2.tech, Investing.com)
    *   Competition Fears and Insider Sales (Forbes)
    *   Insider Sales (TipRanks)

*   **Analysis:** The news is mixed. The Motley Fool article is positive, highlighting the potential of quantum computing stocks. The Benzinga article suggests concerns regarding competition as it mentions Canada's funding plan.  Jefferies' initiation with a $100 target price is a strong positive catalyst.  The Forbes and TipRanks articles point to concerns about competition and insider sales, which can negatively impact investor sentiment.  The "even if sales were routine" qualifier from TipRanks suggests the concern is more about the *perception* of insider sales than necessarily a negative fundamental signal.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (1.70)
*   **Opinions:** 11
*   **Target Price:** $73.96 (Average)
*   **Target Price Range:** $47.00 - $100.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent changes listed.

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Buy," indicating a generally positive outlook on the stock. The average target price of $73.96 suggests significant upside potential from the current price. However, the wide target price range ($47 to $100) reflects the uncertainty and high growth nature of the quantum computing sector.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue   |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | -3.58 | $0.04B   |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.70 | $0.02B   |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.14 | $0.01B   |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24 | $0.01B   |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.24 | $0.01B   |

*   **Analysis:** IONQ is currently unprofitable. The EPS (Earnings Per Share) is negative, and although revenue is increasing, it is not yet at a level to achieve profitability.  The most recent EPS figure (-3.58) is particularly concerning, but the repeated 2025-11-05 entry is likely an error (duplicated data).

    *   **ROE:** The negative Return on Equity (ROE) is a concern, reflecting the company's current lack of profitability. The ROE is getting better.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock in the emerging quantum computing sector. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 but exhibits substantial volatility.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term pullback.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Exceptional growth potential (high CAGR, high expected return)
    *   Strong analyst consensus (Buy rating) and significant upside potential based on target prices
    *   Increasing revenue and high profit margin (for now), indicating growing market acceptance
