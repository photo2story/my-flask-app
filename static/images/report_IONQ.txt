*   **CAGR:** IONQ has shown impressive Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the periods analyzed, increasing significantly from 84.0% to 312.0%. This indicates high growth potential but also suggests potential volatility.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, around 80%, indicating significant risk and price volatility.
*   **Alpha:** High positive Alpha values suggest IONQ is significantly outperforming its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. This outperformance has increased over time.
*   **Beta:** A Beta around 0.0 suggests that IONQ's price movements are not strongly correlated with the S&P 500. This can be seen as a sign of independence from the broader market's movements.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** Sell 80% of holdings (Based on a risky MRI of 0.50)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.3 (+) (Short-term increase in divergence, suggesting upward momentum)
*   **Expected Return:** 31.4% (Over S&P 500, long-term, if investing now)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a relatively high investment recommendation. However, the hybrid signal, based on a lower MRI value, contradicts this, suggesting caution.
*   The RSI indicates that the stock is currently oversold, which could suggest a potential buying opportunity as it might be undervalued in the short term.
*   The positive change in the short-term divergence, coupled with a significant recent price change (+2.51), indicates potential for upward momentum.
*   The high expected return over the long term is a positive sign for investors with a longer time horizon.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue remains very low despite showing a slight increase.
*   **Profit Margin:** The company reports a high-profit margin. However, the revenue is very low to begin with, rendering that margin difficult to interpret.
*   **Equity:** Equity has significantly increased, likely due to investments or stock offerings, showing increased investor confidence.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, reflecting the company's inability to generate profits with shareholders' investments. While it has slightly improved, it remains a concern.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.

*   **Positives:** High historical returns compared to the S&P 500, strong analyst ratings, a growing market capitalization, and potential for future growth in the quantum computing sector. The MRI indicates a high investment recommendation.
*   **Negatives:** High volatility (as indicated by the MDD), negative earnings, relatively small revenue, negative ROE, recent news suggesting a potential bubble in the sector, and the hybrid signal suggesting selling 80% of holdings (contradicting the MRI).
*   **Key Considerations:** Investors should be aware of the speculative nature of quantum computing stocks and the potential for significant price swings. The upcoming earnings announcement is a critical event that could significantly impact the stock's price. While the expected long-term return is attractive, it is based on potentially optimistic assumptions about the future of quantum computing and IONQ's ability to capitalize on it. The RSI indicates an oversold condition, which is good to consider.

**Recommendation:** Given the data, a highly cautious approach is warranted. If investing, a small allocation is advisable, focusing on the long term and being prepared for significant volatility. Close monitoring of upcoming earnings and industry news is essential.
