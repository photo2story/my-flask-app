**Analysis of Alpha/Beta and Risk Metrics:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%    | 82.3%    | 83.0%    | -0.0   | 4.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0%   | 82.3%    | 188.0%   | -0.0   | 13.5   |
| 2023-2025  | 386.0%   | 74.2%    | 323.0%   | 0.0    | 23.7   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows very high growth rates over the periods analyzed, increasing significantly from 84% to 386%.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates the potential downside risk. MDD is substantial, suggesting high volatility and risk, especially in the first two periods (over 80%). The most recent period shows a decrease in MDD (74.2%), but it remains a high level of risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Represents the excess return compared to a benchmark (presumably S&P 500). The high positive Alpha values indicate that IONQ has significantly outperformed the benchmark in all periods, with the most recent period showing an extraordinary Alpha of 323%.
*   **Beta:**  Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta close to 0 indicates that the stock's price is not strongly correlated with the market. This is unusual, especially for a growth stock, and might suggest other factors are driving the stock's performance.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** Shows a significant increase in market capitalization over the periods, from $4.0B to $23.7B, reflecting the company's growth in value.

**Overall:** The table paints a picture of a high-growth, high-risk stock. The extremely high CAGR and Alpha values suggest that IONQ has been a very successful investment over these periods, generating significant returns above the market. However, the high MDD values also indicate substantial potential for losses. A Beta of close to 0 is intriguing and could mean that the stock's performance is driven by company-specific factors rather than broader market movements.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 73.28
*   **Previous Close:** 69.6
*   **Change:** 5.29 (Significant positive change)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 66.13
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 62.19
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 48.38

**Analysis:** The price is well above all three moving averages, indicating a strong upward trend.  The substantial positive change from the previous close (5.29) suggests a recent surge in price.

**3. Indicators & Signals**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended). This suggests the model sees IONQ as a relatively safe investment despite its growth stock profile.
*   **RSI:** 67.08 (Approaching overbought territory).
*   **PPO:** -0.92 (Relatively neutral, slightly below zero)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (23 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.7% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02).  Strong buy signal, with a recommendation to fully invest available cash and continue monthly investment.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Excess Return Change:** 8.4 (+) (Short-term upward momentum).
*   **Expected Return (%):** 16.3 (Long-term expected outperformance vs. S&P 500).

**Analysis:**  The indicators paint a mixed picture. The MRI and Hybrid Signal are strongly bullish. RSI nearing overbought levels suggests caution in the short term.  The PPO is relatively neutral.  The strong recent change in relative excess return and high expected return are positive signals. The notable price change (5.29) indicates a potential catalyst driving recent momentum.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE       |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| 2025-06-30 | $1.16B  | -15.22%   |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.77B  | -4.22%    |

| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B  | -8.11%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains low but showed an increase recently. The profit margin is consistently positive, which is a positive sign, suggesting that the company has good cost control on sales.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** The equity has increased significantly over the past year, indicating that the company has been raising capital, which may be needed to fund its growth initiatives. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is negative for all periods, reflecting the company's lack of profitability. Despite having positive profit margins, the negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating sufficient profits relative to its equity. This could be due to high operating expenses or other factors offsetting the gains from sales.

**7. Summary and Conclusion**

IONQ is a high-growth stock in the quantum computing sector with significant potential.  However, it also carries substantial risk.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Exceptional historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   Strong recent price momentum and positive news catalysts.
    *   Bullish market risk indicator and hybrid signal.
    *   Positive analyst sentiment.
    *   Significant increase in equity, indicating strong access to capital.
*   **Negatives:**
    *   High maximum drawdown, indicating significant potential for price declines.
    *   Negative earnings and ROE, indicating a lack of current profitability.
    *   The current price is already above the average analyst target price.

**Overall Recommendation:**

IONQ appears to be a speculative investment suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance. The company's future prospects are heavily reliant on the successful development and commercialization of its quantum computing technology. Investors should carefully weigh the potential rewards against the significant risks before investing. A "Buy" recommendation may be appropriate for those with a long-term investment horizon and a strong belief in the future of quantum computing, but caution is warranted. Consider setting stop-loss orders to manage potential downside risk. The recent jump in price and positive news flow warrant a close watch, but further profitability is needed to justify the current valuation.
