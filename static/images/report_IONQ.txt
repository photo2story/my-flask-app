The expected return of 15.5% indicates strong confidence in IONQ's ability to outperform the S&P 500 over the long term, but the analysis should reflect the recent price drop.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $0.02B    | 59.76%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.01B    | 42.97%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B    | 56.92%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B    | 47.46%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.01B    | 50.59%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE           |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $1.16B    | -15.22%       |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.77B    | -4.22%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B    | -52.62%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B    | -12.05%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B    | -8.11%        |

**Analysis:** Revenue is consistently at $0.01B or $0.02B, and profit margins, while positive, do not translate to profitability. The increasing equity suggests capital raising activities (confirmed by the news). ROE is negative, reflecting the company's current lack of profitability. The significant decrease in equity between 2024-06-30 and 2024-12-31 could be a cause for concern if it is not a normal part of the company's financial cycle.

**7. Summary**

IONQ has shown exceptional historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, the recent stock price drop, driven by the equity offering and a worse-than-expected EPS, warrants caution. While analyst consensus remains positive, and the long-term growth potential of quantum computing is promising, investors should carefully consider the company's lack of current profitability, significant volatility, and reliance on capital raises. The high MRI suggests that investment is still reasonable, but the negative EPS should be taken into consideration.
