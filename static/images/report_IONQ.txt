**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  IONQ exhibits very high Compound Annual Growth Rates over the periods. This is very positive, but it's important to remember this is growth in a relatively early stage company, and high growth rates might not be sustainable.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown figures are quite high, indicating significant volatility and risk. Investors should be prepared for substantial price swings.
*   **Alpha:**  The high Alpha values suggest IONQ's returns are largely independent of the market. This implies that the company's performance is driven by its own specific factors rather than broad market trends.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values close to 0 suggests IONQ's price is not correlated to the market at all.

*   The recent negative change in relative divergence points to a short-term downward trend compared to the S&P 500.
*   The expected return of 38.3% is substantial, but it's important to remember this is a forward-looking estimate and not guaranteed.
