2025-10-25 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of IONQ (IONQ Inc.), incorporating the provided data. I'll present the information in English with a focus on key metrics, comparative analysis, and actionable insights.

**Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 318.91%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 46.96%
*   **Absolute Difference:** 272.5%
*   **Relative Difference Percentile:** 71.6% (Indicates IONQ's outperformance is in the 71.6th percentile of its historical range vs. VOO)

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period. However, the "Relative Difference Percentile" suggests that while the outperformance is substantial, it is within the upper range of its historical fluctuation relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%   | 82.3%   | 83.0%   | -0.0   | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0%  | 82.3%   | 188.0%  | -0.0   | 14.7   |
| 2023-2025  | 325.0%  | 80.5%   | 262.0%  | 0.0    | 21.0   |

*   **CAGR:**  Shows explosive growth rates, particularly in the most recent period.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown indicates significant price volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Extremely high alpha values suggest significant outperformance relative to a market benchmark, but can also reflect high idiosyncratic risk.
*   **Beta:** A Beta close to 0 suggests that IONQ is less correlated with the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization.

**Analysis:** The high CAGR and Alpha highlight the potential for substantial returns, but the large MDD underscores the volatility and risk associated with investing in IONQ. The low Beta suggests that IONQ's price movements are relatively independent of the broader market, which could be seen as a diversification benefit or a reflection of its unique industry.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 59.51
*   **Last Market Price:** 60.32 (+1.6% change)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 64.12
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 70.11
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 54.07

**Analysis:** The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend. The recent price increase of 1.6% is notable, hinting at a possible short-term rebound.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 47.25 (Neutral - not overbought or oversold)
*   **PPO:** -4.24 (Negative - suggesting a possible downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_80%_Sell (Indicates a risk-averse strategy, recommending selling 80% of holdings due to risk – MRI: 0.50)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Difference Change:** -28.4 (Negative - Short-term decline in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return:** 31.0% (Projected excess return over S&P 500 with long-term, consistent investment)

**Analysis:**  While the MRI is relatively high, suggesting favorable investment conditions based on the model, the Hybrid Signal strongly suggests reducing exposure due to perceived risk. The negative PPO and declining relative difference support the idea of recent underperformance. The high expected return reflects optimism about IONQ's long-term potential despite the short-term headwinds. The divergence between MRI and Hybrid Signal should be noted to assess risk.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Jim Cramer's Commentary:** The news highlighting Jim Cramer's uncertainty about IONQ and his negative view on Rigetti (RGTI) suggest investor sentiment might be mixed.
*   **Positive Headlines:** News about IONQ achieving record quantum fidelity and positive stock coverage from StockStory could boost investor confidence.
*   **Competition:** News about D-Wave's stock surge due to potential government investment highlights the competitive landscape in the quantum computing sector.
*   **Trending Stock:** IONQ being mentioned in a Yahoo Finance video about trending stocks indicates heightened investor interest.

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag.  The commentary from Jim Cramer may induce uncertainty in some investors. However, breakthroughs in quantum fidelity and coverage as a "trending stock" are positives. It's crucial to monitor competitor activity and overall sector sentiment.
