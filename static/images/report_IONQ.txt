2025-11-27 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the analysis of IONQ.

**0) Report Structure**

We'll follow your structure: First, present the numbers, then provide analysis based on those numbers.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **IONQ Inc.:** A quantum computing company.
*   **Cumulative Return (IONQ):** 297.56%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 47.28%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 248.0
    *   Relative Divergence: 65.8 (Meaning the divergence is in the 65.8th percentile of its historical range)

**Analysis:**

IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) since its inception in the market. The cumulative return is substantially higher. However, the relative divergence of 65.8 indicates that while the outperformance is significant, it's not at the very peak compared to its own historical volatility. There could be more potential depending on the future stock performance.

**Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Analysis**

|            | CAGR      | MDD    | Alpha     | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%     | 82.3%  | 83.0%     | -0.0 | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0%    | 82.3%  | 188.0%    | -0.0 | 14.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 304.0%    | 79.6%  | 240.0%    | 0.0  | 16.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Compound Annual Growth Rate is exceptionally high, indicating aggressive growth over the periods. The CAGR increases from 84% to 304% over the different timeframes.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. IONQ experienced significant drawdowns, ranging from 79.6% to 82.3%, highlighting the stock's volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis, indicating how much an investment has outperformed or underperformed its benchmark index. The high Alpha values suggest significant outperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta of near 0 indicates very little correlation with the S&P 500, which can be due to its status as a development-stage firm, with limited revenues, but a lot of investor excitement.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization grew over the time periods from 4.4 to 16.6 billion, showing strong increase in investor confidence and market valuation.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 47.05
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 46.94, Previous Close: 47.06, Change: -0.25
*   **5-day SMA:** 44.87
*   **20-day SMA:** 52.10
*   **60-day SMA:** 59.44

**Analysis:**

The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is also below the current price, indicating recent downward price movement. The relatively large difference between the SMAs indicates potential volatility and momentum shifts.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 38.32 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.05 (Negative, indicating potential for oversold conditions)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_80%_Sell (80% of holdings recommended)
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -0.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 38.2% (Over 2 years, compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation. However, the Hybrid signal suggests selling 80% of the holdings. This discrepancy is very important.
*   The RSI value suggests that the stock is approaching oversold conditions, which can present a buying opportunity.
*   The negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is trending below the long-term moving average, indicating potential weakness.
*   The Hybrid Signal is highly bearish. This, along with the 20-day divergence decline, indicates recent selling pressure.
*   The expected return is fairly high, indicating a large return on investment given a two year horizon.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Sentiment:** Several articles suggest potential upside and comparing IONQ to NVIDIA, indicating high growth potential. Articles like "Could Buying IonQ Stock Today Set You Up for Life?" and "Can IonQ Stock Become the Next NVIDIA" reflect this.
*   **Workforce Growth:** The news about IONQ reaching 1,000 employees is a positive indicator of the company's growth and expansion.
*   **Billionaire Interest (Caution):** One article notes that billionaires have a different favorite quantum computing stock. While not directly negative for IONQ, it suggests that other companies in the sector may be more attractive to some large investors.
*   **Buy the Dip?**: One article suggests buying the dip, which might be a good investment strategy for the stock.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. There's positive coverage focusing on long-term growth potential and comparisons to successful tech companies. However, the article regarding billionaire preferences serves as a cautionary point. It's important to weigh the positive news against the potential risks and competition within the quantum computing space.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.78)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 72.35, High: 100.00, Low: 47.00

**Analysis:**

Analyst consensus leans toward a "Buy" rating, with a significant potential upside based on the average target price. The high target price (100.00) indicates strong bullish expectations from some analysts. However, the low target price (47.00) is near the current price, implying that some analysts see limited or no upside. The lack of recent rating changes suggests either stability in the analysts' views or a lack of updated analysis.
