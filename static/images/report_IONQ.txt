## IONQ Inc. (IONQ) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

IONQ Inc. is a company focused on developing quantum computing technologies.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, though profitability remains a concern.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend, despite long-term growth potential.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

IONQ's cumulative return (167.75%) drastically outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (11.07%). The relative divergence indicates IONQ's performance is significantly higher than VOO's, positioned at the 59.2 percentile of its historical range.  However, this strong performance is partially attributable to high volatility (beta).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2023-2025  | 169.0% | 67.0% | 161.0% | 0.1 | 6.2 |

The high Alpha values suggest significant outperformance relative to the market, but the high Beta values indicate substantial price volatility.  Market risk should be carefully considered.  The fluctuating market capitalization also points to a high-growth, high-risk investment.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $24.03
* **Previous Close:** $25.74
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $25.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $24.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $28.73

The price has recently declined (-6.64%), falling below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The price is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more pronounced downward trend over the past two months.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.63 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 31.2% (Long-term potential, exceeding S&P 500)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO suggests bullish momentum, the recent price drop and negative relative divergence indicate short-term weakness.  The high expected return highlights potential long-term growth, but the medium risk level underscores the volatility associated with the investment. The significant negative price change (-6.64%) indicates a sudden price drop, requiring further investigation into potential market events.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ exhibits high growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the provided timeframe. However, this performance comes with substantial risk due to high volatility and consistent unprofitability. The recent price drop suggests a short-term bearish trend, while long-term projections remain optimistic.  Investors should carefully weigh the high risk associated with IONQ's high beta and negative ROE against the potential for significant long-term returns. Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop is warranted.  A long-term, carefully managed investment approach might be suitable for risk-tolerant investors, but thorough due diligence is crucial.
