| 2023-2025  | 305.0% | 79.6%  | 239.0%  | 0.0   | 17.5   |

**Analysis:**
*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** IONQ shows impressive CAGR, increasing significantly each year, indicating rapid growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The high MDD values suggest that the stock experiences significant price drops from peak to trough, indicating high volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The positive and high alpha values show that IONQ has outperformed its benchmark, indicating that the stock's returns are not just due to overall market movements.
*   **Beta:** A beta close to 0 suggests that IONQ's price movements are largely independent of the broader market.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** The market capitalization has increased considerably over the years, reflecting the company's growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 49.30

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news headlines present a mixed picture. Some articles are positive, discussing price target increases and the potential to "buy the dip." Others are more cautious, warning about the stock's valuation and the need for quantum computing investors to "wake up" to potential risks.
*   **Bubble Warning:** The article about a potential market bubble in 2026 is a general market concern, not specific to IONQ, but it's worth noting in any investment analysis.
*   **Valuation Concerns:** Several articles focus on IONQ's valuation, questioning whether it's trading at a premium. This suggests that valuation is a key concern for investors.

**Analysis:** The recent news suggests volatility and uncertainty surrounding IONQ. While some analysts are optimistic, there are also concerns about valuation and potential risks. Investors should carefully consider these factors before investing.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.78)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 72.35 / High: 100.00 / Low: 47.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No specific changes are listed, indicating stable analyst sentiment.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a mean rating of 1.78, indicating a generally positive outlook. The average target price of $72.35 suggests potential upside from the current price. However, the range between the high and low target prices ($47.00 to $100.00) indicates a significant degree of uncertainty among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | -3.58 | 0.04 B$   |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.7  | 0.02 B$   |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.14 | 0.01 B$   |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24 | 0.01 B$   |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.24 | 0.01 B$   |

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** IONQ has consistently reported negative EPS, indicating that the company is currently not profitable. The most recent EPS of -3.58 is particularly concerning.
*   **Revenue:** While revenue has increased over the quarters, it remains relatively low. The revenue numbers are in billions of dollars (B$), which would be uncommonly high for IONQ at this stage, so this likely indicates a data error. A more reasonable estimate for revenue would be in millions of dollars, not billions.

The large negative EPS coupled with still low revenue suggests that IONQ is still in the early stages of growth and is investing heavily in its business. The high negative EPS figure in the most recent report would warrant further investigation.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.04B    | 46.69%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.02B    | 59.76%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.01B    | 42.97%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B    | 56.92%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B    | 47.46%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE        |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $2.27B    | -46.41%    |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.16B    | -15.22%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.77B    | -4.22%     |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B    | -52.62%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B    | -12.05%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has been increasing, indicating business growth. Again, the unit is very likely wrong in this table, and should likely be in millions rather than billions.
*   **Profit Margin:** The profit margins are positive, which is encouraging. However, it's important to note that these are likely *gross* profit margins. Given the negative EPS, the company has significant operating expenses.
*   **Equity:** Equity has increased significantly, likely due to funding rounds or stock offerings.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** The negative ROE values confirm that the company is not yet profitable. The high negative ROE in certain quarters indicates significant losses relative to the company's equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but it also exhibits high volatility. The company is currently not profitable, as indicated by negative EPS and ROE. However, revenue is growing, and analyst sentiment is generally positive.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Valuation:** Several news articles and the wide range in analyst price targets suggest that valuation is a key concern. Investors should carefully consider whether the current stock price is justified given the company's current financial performance.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** The high volatility and negative profitability make IONQ suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance.
*   **Long-Term Potential:** IONQ is a leader in the emerging quantum computing industry. If the company can successfully commercialize its technology, it has the potential for significant growth in the long term.
*   **Financial Health:** While the financial data shows increased equity and positive gross profit margins, continued losses and large expenditures are apparent from the negative EPS, which will likely need to be stabilized in the future.
* **Erroneous Data:** The provided data likely includes errors in terms of revenue and profit, being expressed in billions rather than millions of dollars. Care should be taken to verify this data before making investment decisions.

**Recommendation:**

Investing in IONQ is a speculative bet on the future of quantum computing. It is essential to do your own due diligence and consider your own risk tolerance before investing. Given the high-risk nature of the stock, it should only be a small portion of a diversified portfolio. While many indicators are positive, negative indicators, the potential for erroneous data, as well as the high volatility are important to note.
