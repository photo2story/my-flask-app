2025-05-04 - Analysis Report
## IONQ Inc. (IONQ) Stock Report

**0. Summary of Key Figures:**

IONQ Inc. shows a significantly higher cumulative return than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  However,  high volatility and negative profitability metrics raise concerns. Recent price action suggests a rapid increase, exceeding both short-term and long-term moving averages.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

IONQ Inc. is a company developing quantum computing systems and technologies.

* **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 240.16%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 21.42%
* **Return Difference:** 218.7% (This is a large difference, however, the relative divergence of 78.3% indicates that while it's high, it's not at an extreme historical outlier.)

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0% | 72.8% | 71.0% | 0.1 | 3.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 199.0% | 72.8% | 178.0% | 0.0 | 10.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 242.0% | 67.0% | 223.0% | 0.1 | 7.5 |

**Analysis:**  IONQ exhibits extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) significantly outperforming the market.  However, the high Beta (especially in 2022-2024) suggests substantial market sensitivity and risk.  Alpha values are also high, suggesting significant outperformance, but the data needs further examination and the Alpha values seem incongruent with the Beta values.  The substantial market capitalization increase is notable.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $30.92
* **5-day Moving Average:** $28.51
* **20-day Moving Average:** $26.02
* **60-day Moving Average:** $26.90

**Analysis:** The closing price is significantly above all three moving averages, indicating a recent sharp price increase.  The last market price shows a 12.93% increase from the previous day. This suggests a rapid price surge, a potential short squeeze, or some other significant positive catalyst.  Further investigation into the news surrounding IONQ would be required to determine the root cause.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 66.74 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.82 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 18.2% (This is a significant expected return relative to the S&P500, but high risk should be factored into this)

**Analysis:** The technical indicators show mixed signals. While the PPO and relative divergence suggest upward momentum, the RSI is approaching overbought levels, hinting at potential short-term correction. The high Expected Return reflects the large potential in the quantum computing space, but also the inherent risks involved in a high-growth, early-stage company. Given the price jumped 12.93% from the previous close, this should be considered a rapid upward movement.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.24  | $0.01 B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -$0.18  | $0.01 B      |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.19  | $0.01 B      |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.22  | $0.01 B      |
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.22  | $0.01 B      |  *(Note: Duplicate entry)*

**Analysis:**  The company is consistently reporting negative EPS, indicating that it is not yet profitable.  Revenue remains relatively flat around $0.01B.  This is a significant concern, especially considering the high valuation implied by the stock price.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B | 56.92% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B | 47.46% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.01B | 50.59% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.01B | 54.97% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.01B | 48.20% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B | -52.62% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B | -12.05% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B | -8.11% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B | -8.25% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.48B | -8.64% |

**Analysis:** While profit margins appear positive, the consistently negative ROE (Return on Equity) is a major red flag.  This indicates that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity, despite relatively high profit margins.  Further investigation into the financial statements is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative ROE.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ shows phenomenal growth in its stock price, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this growth is driven by factors that don't reflect underlying profitability.  The company is not yet profitable, showing consistent negative EPS and ROE. High beta suggests high volatility and significant market risk.  While the high CAGR and projected return are enticing,  the negative financial fundamentals and high RSI pose significant risk.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in IONQ.  The recent sharp price increase warrants further investigation into potential news or catalysts.  This could be a speculative bubble rather than a sustainable upward trend.
