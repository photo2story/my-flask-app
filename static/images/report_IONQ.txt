2025-12-13 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down this IONQ analysis, step-by-step.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Ticker:** IONQ
*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company.
*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 316.13%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 50.24%
*   **Divergence:** 289.7 (Relative Divergence: 75.0)

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return of IONQ is more than six times that of the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 75.0 suggests that the current outperformance is positioned in the higher range compared to its historical data relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3%  | 83.0%  | -0.0   | 4.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 82.3%  | 188.0% | -0.0  | 14.4   |
| 2023-2025  | 323.0% | 79.6%  | 256.0% | 0.0   | 17.8   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  IONQ's Compounded Annual Growth Rate is very high and increasing over the periods shown, indicating substantial growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is significant, suggesting high volatility and risk. A drawdown of around 80% means that at some point, the investment lost 80% of its value from its peak.
*   **Alpha:** The positive and high Alpha values show that IONQ is significantly outperforming its benchmark (the market) on a risk-adjusted basis. This indicates the stock's return is independent of overall market movements.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is near zero, suggesting IONQ's price is not strongly correlated with the overall market. In other words, IONQ's stock moves independently of the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization is increasing over time, indicating company growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 51.68
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 50.35, Previous Close: 52.55, Change: -4.19
*   **5-day SMA:** 53.596
*   **20-day SMA:** 48.576
*   **60-day SMA:** 59.9443

**Analysis:**  The stock price has recently decreased (negative change). The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which suggests a short-term upward trend, but the 60-day SMA is still significantly higher, indicating a possible longer-term downward trend or consolidation phase. The negative change in the last market data points towards potential selling pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 55.88
*   **PPO:** 2.45
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (21 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 14.2 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 29.8

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.8 suggests that, based on this indicator, IONQ is a medium-risk investment.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 55.88 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 2.45 indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which is a bullish sign but needs to be seen in context with other indicators.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy signal based on its criteria.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:**  The increase in relative divergence over the past 20 days supports the short-term upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The 29.8% expected return is very optimistic, suggesting significant potential upside for long-term investors (2+ years).

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:** The news headlines revolve around IONQ's positioning within the quantum computing sector, potential for growth, analyst recommendations, and comparisons to other quantum stocks. Some headlines suggest the stock could double, while others emphasize the need for patience.
*   **Overall Sentiment:** The sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with an emphasis on the long-term potential of quantum computing but also acknowledging the risks and the need for careful stock selection within the sector.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.70)
*   **Opinions:** 11
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 73.96 / High: 100.00 / Low: 47.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Buy" with a mean rating around "Buy". The average target price suggests a significant upside from the current price. However, there's a wide range between the high and low target prices, reflecting uncertainty in the stock's future performance. The lack of recent rating changes suggests the analysts are staying on the sidelines regarding the stock's near term performance.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | -3.58  | 0.04 B$   |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.7   | 0.02 B$   |

| 2025-11-05 | -0.24  | 0.01 B$   |

**Analysis:** IONQ is currently not profitable. EPS (Earnings Per Share) is negative for all reported periods. While revenue is growing, the losses are significant. The large negative EPS in the most recent quarter is a concern. This is not unusual for a growth company that may be investing heavily in R&D and expansion but still needs to be monitored.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue Growth:** Revenue is increasing, which is positive.
*   **Profit Margin:**  Profit margins are relatively high, which is a good sign if IONQ can scale up the revenue.
*   **Equity:** Equity has grown considerably, which suggests the company is attracting investment and strengthening its balance sheet.
*   **ROE:**  The Return on Equity (ROE) is negative, reflecting the company's unprofitability. As Equity grows, ROE should improve with better profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **High Growth, High Risk:** IONQ exhibits very high growth potential, indicated by its impressive CAGR and significant outperformance of the S&P 500. However, this growth comes with substantial risk, as reflected in its large maximum drawdown and negative earnings.
*   **Independent Performance:** The low Beta suggests that IONQ's stock performance is relatively independent of the overall market, which can be attractive to investors seeking diversification.
*   **Market Sentiment:** Recent news and analyst opinions show cautious optimism. Analysts recommend a "Buy" but acknowledge the long-term nature of quantum computing and the need for patience.
*   **Financials:** The company is currently unprofitable, but revenue is growing, and profit margins are relatively high. The increasing equity base suggests strong investor confidence and the ability to fund future growth.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Technical indicators provide a mixed picture, with some suggesting short-term upward momentum while others point to potential longer-term consolidation.

**Overall Recommendation:**

IONQ appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment. Its high growth potential, driven by its position in the emerging quantum computing sector, is attractive. However, investors should be aware of the significant risks, including the company's current unprofitability, high volatility, and the long-term nature of the industry. A small allocation, with a long-term investment horizon, may be appropriate for investors with a high-risk tolerance. It's crucial to monitor the company's earnings reports and industry developments closely.
