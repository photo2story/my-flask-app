**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE      |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $2.27B  | -46.41%  |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.16B  | -15.22%  |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.44B  | -12.05%  |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue is growing, doubling from early 2024 to late 2025.
*   Profit margins are surprisingly high, indicating good efficiency in revenue generation. However, these margins do not translate into overall profitability due to high operating expenses.
*   Equity has increased significantly, likely due to fundraising.
*   ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, reflecting the company's unprofitability. The large negative ROE values confirm that the company is losing money despite growing revenues.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **High Growth, High Risk:** IonQ has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, characterized by substantial CAGR and Alpha. However, this is coupled with high volatility and risk, as evidenced by the MDD.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Recent price action suggests a downward trend, with the stock trading below its moving averages and a negative change in relative divergence. While the RSI is nearing oversold territory, it is not a definitive buy signal.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts are generally positive on IonQ, with a "Buy" consensus and a higher average target price.
*   **Financial Performance:** The company is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE. However, revenue is growing, and profit margins are high. The company's financial health depends on its ability to scale revenue and achieve profitability.
*   **News and Market Positioning:** IonQ is a prominent player in the quantum computing space, as highlighted by frequent comparisons to competitors in news articles.

**Overall:** IonQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock. The company has significant potential, but it is still in its early stages of development and faces challenges in achieving profitability. Investing in IonQ is highly speculative and suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance. The long-term success of IonQ depends on its ability to commercialize its technology and establish a leading position in the quantum computing market.
