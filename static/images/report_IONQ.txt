## IONQ Inc. (IONQ) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

IONQ Inc. is a company developing quantum computing systems and solutions.  The cumulative return of IONQ is 216.24%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 63.16%. The difference is 153.08%, placing it at the 93.49th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max range).  This suggests substantial outperformance but also significant volatility.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 14.7% | 82.5% | -20.2% | 2.4 | 2.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 59.6% | 70.7% | 30.7% | 2.6 | 5.5 |

The high Beta values (2.4 to 5.5) indicate significant sensitivity to market movements.  The Alpha values fluctuate, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance compared to the market.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) highlights substantial risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $27.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $27.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.67

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the significant difference between the short-term and longer-term averages highlights the recent price surge.  This rapid increase warrants caution.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 69.27 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.27 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +54.89 (Strong upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -0.01% (This likely represents a short-term expectation;  long-term potential is discussed below).

The combination of a high RSI, positive PPO, and significant positive divergence suggests strong upward momentum in the short term.  However, the RSI nearing overbought levels warns of potential near-term corrections. The -0.01% expected return needs clarification on timeframe and consideration that it might be based on short-term models while the investment is envisioned for the long term. The 27.89 closing price significantly above moving averages indicates a recent sharp upswing (potentially a rapid surge).

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue    |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24  | $0.01 B    |
| 2024-08-07 | -0.18  | $0.01 B    |

| 2023-11-09 | -0.22  | $0.01 B    |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.22  | $0.01 B    |

IONQ consistently reports negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses. Revenue remains relatively flat around $0.01B.  A detailed analysis of the most recent earnings report (including analyst expectations) is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  The repetition of 2024-11-06 in the table needs clarification, likely a data entry error.

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

**1) Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue remains consistently low,  while profit margins fluctuate but are generally positive, though operating at a loss.

**2) Capital and Profitability:** Negative ROE consistently demonstrates that the company is not yet generating returns on equity.  This is concerning for long-term investors.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

**8. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ demonstrates significant short-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, fueled by strong recent price action. However, this performance is accompanied by considerable volatility and risk, as evidenced by the high Beta, MDD, and consistently negative EPS. While short-term technical indicators suggest bullish momentum, the high RSI warns of potential near-term corrections.  The company's consistent losses and negative ROE raise significant concerns about long-term sustainability.  Further investigation into the most recent earnings report and relevant news articles is necessary to form a complete picture.  A long-term investment strategy needs to weigh the potential for future growth against the current high risk profile.  The provided expected return of -0.01% is too short-term to reflect the overall long-term picture.  A detailed analysis of the long-term projections and industry outlook is essential.
