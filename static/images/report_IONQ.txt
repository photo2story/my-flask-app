2025-11-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of IONQ, based on the data provided, broken down into the requested sections:

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** IONQ: IONQ Inc.
*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company.
*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 290.64%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 42.66%
*   **Divergence:** (Max: 391.7, Min: -28.9, Current: 248.0, Relative Divergence: 65.8)

**Analysis:**

IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by a substantial margin. The current divergence of 248.0 indicates IONQ's cumulative return is 248 percentage points higher than the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 65.8 suggests the current divergence is in the upper half of the historical range, but not at the extreme high. The returns are impressive but need to be considered alongside risk.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
| :----------- | :----- | :----- | :------ | :---- | :------ |
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3%  | 83.0%  | -0.0 | 4.4     |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 82.3%  | 188.0% | -0.0 | 14.8    |
| 2023-2025  | 297.0% | 79.6%  | 238.0% | 0.0   | 14.8    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Demonstrates extremely high growth rates over the periods, increasing each year. This shows significant revenue growth in the sector (quantum computing), making it attractive to future investors.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High drawdown values indicate significant volatility and risk.  Investors should be aware of the potential for large price swings.
*   **Alpha:** The very high alpha values suggest IONQ is significantly outperforming its expected return based on its risk. This could be due to specific company performance or broader excitement around quantum computing.
*   **Beta:** Betas close to 0 suggest that IONQ's price is not well correlated to the market in general.
*   **Cap(B):** The increase in market capitalization indicates growing investor confidence and increased valuation of the company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 41.67
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 41.71, 'previousClose': 41.0, 'change': 1.73}
*   **5-day SMA:** 45.49
*   **20-day SMA:** 53.40
*   **60-day SMA:** 59.30

**Analysis:**

The shorter-term moving averages (5-day, 20-day) are below the longer-term moving average (60-day). This indicates a recent downward trend in the stock price. The last market data suggests a slight upward movement today, which could be a sign of a potential rebound, but it's too early to tell. The difference between the 5-day SMA and 60-day SMA is large, indicating a substantial price decrease over the past few weeks.

**3) RSI, PPO & Market Risk Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 27.52
*   **PPO:** -2.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell 80.0% of holdings (3082 shares - Risky - MRI:0.50) (Cash Ratio: 80% on 2025-10-16)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 38.2%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation (0.8) suggests moderate risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 27.52 indicates that IONQ is currently oversold. This often suggests a potential for a price reversal (bounce).
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-2.42) indicates a downward trend in momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests to sell 80% of holdings and hold a high cash position (80%).  This is a cautious signal, given the risk profile and recent price decline.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative divergence change confirms the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The 38.2% expected return is a positive sign, suggesting strong future growth potential if held for more than two years.

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean:** 1.78 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 10
*   **Target Price:** 72.35 / 100.00 / 47.00

However, there is a wide range in target prices (47.00 to 100.00), reflecting uncertainty about the company's future valuation.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue  |
| :--------- | :----- | :------- |
| 2025-11-05 | -3.58  | 0.04 B$  |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.7   | 0.02 B$  |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.14  | 0.01 B$  |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24  | 0.01 B$  |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.24  | 0.01 B$  |

**Analysis:**

IONQ is currently unprofitable.  EPS (Earnings Per Share) is negative for all reported quarters.  While revenue is increasing, the losses are significant.  The most recent EPS of -3.58 is particularly concerning and requires further investigation. The revenue and EPS data indicates that the company is still in its initial growth stages and may still be a long-term investment.

**6) Financial Information**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

    | Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
    | :----------- | :------ | :------------ |
    | 2025-09-30   | $0.04B  | 46.69%        |
    | 2025-06-30   | $0.02B  | 59.76%        |
    | 2025-03-31   | $0.01B  | 42.97%        |
    | 2024-12-31   | $0.01B  | 56.92%        |
    | 2024-09-30   | $0.01B  | 47.46%        |

*   **Capital and Profitability:**

    | Quarter      | Equity  | ROE      |
    | :----------- | :------ | :------- |
    | 2025-09-30   | $2.27B  | -46.41%  |
    | 2025-06-30   | $1.16B  | -15.22%  |
    | 2025-03-31   | $0.77B  | -4.22%   |
    | 2024-12-31   | $0.38B  | -52.62%  |
    | 2024-09-30   | $0.44B  | -12.05%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** While revenue is growing, the extremely high-profit margins suggest possible accounting anomalies, small revenue base making a big impact on the ratios, or that the business model depends heavily on grants or contracts, instead of recurring commercial revenues.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has significantly increased, indicating potential capital raises through equity offerings. Negative ROE (Return on Equity) confirms the company's current lack of profitability.  The ROE fluctuates, requiring more investigation to understand the underlying cause.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk quantum computing company.

*   **Positive Aspects:**
    *   Exceptional historical return compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High CAGR and Alpha values.
    *   Strong revenue growth.
    *   High-profit margins.
    *   Positive analyst consensus with a significantly higher average target price.
    *   High expected return for long-term investors.

*   **Negative Aspects:**
    *   Very high volatility (high MDD).
    *   Unprofitable with negative EPS and ROE.
    *   Recent downward price trend.
    *   Cautious hybrid signal suggesting a sell-off.
    *   Conflicting news headlines.
    *   High dependence on grants and contracts in revenue.

**Investment Recommendation:**

IONQ is a speculative investment. The quantum computing industry is still in its early stages, and IONQ's success is not guaranteed. While the potential upside is substantial, the risks are equally significant.

*   **Aggressive Investors:**  With a high-risk tolerance and belief in the long-term potential of quantum computing may find IONQ attractive, but should allocate only a small portion of their portfolio.
*   **Conservative Investors:** Should avoid IONQ until the company demonstrates consistent profitability and reduced volatility.
    *   **All investors** should conduct thorough due diligence and carefully consider their own risk tolerance before investing in IONQ.

In summary, IONQ presents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. The company's impressive historical performance and growth potential are tempered by its lack of profitability, high volatility, and the uncertain future of the quantum computing industry.
