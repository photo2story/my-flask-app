## IONQ Inc. (IONQ) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

IONQ Inc. is a company developing trapped-ion quantum computers.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but also high volatility.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this performance.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

IONQ's cumulative return (116.92%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (23.99%). The difference (92.9%) is at the 60.6th percentile of the historical range (-57.0% to 190.3%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and significant beta values, indicating high sensitivity to market movements.  The CAGR varies significantly across the periods, suggesting inconsistent performance.  Specifically:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                               |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|---------------------------------------|
| 2021-2023  | 39.0% | 75.8% | 28.0% | 0.1   | 2.8   | Relatively low beta, positive alpha     |
| 2022-2024  | 185.0%| 75.8% | 156.0%| 0.0   | 9.4   | Extremely high CAGR, near zero alpha  |
| 2023-2025  | 170.0%| 75.5% | 140.0%| 0.1   | 5.3   | High CAGR, positive alpha             |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $23.65
* **Last Market Change:** -$2.63 (a significant daily drop of approximately 11.7%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $24.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $22.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $33.09

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend. The recent significant negative change warrants further investigation for potential triggers.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.90 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 2.94 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -1.9% (Short-term negative expectation)
* **Long-term (2+ years) Expected Return vs. S&P 500:**  Cannot be reliably determined from provided data.  High volatility and inconsistent performance make long-term projections difficult.  The significant outperformance in some periods does suggest *potential* for long-term alpha, but this is not guaranteed.  The considerable risk (high beta and MDD) should be carefully considered.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

IONQ has consistently reported negative EPS and relatively flat revenue in the recent quarters.  The revenue figure remains low.  A detailed analysis of the company's business model and growth prospects is needed to interpret these results in the context of its early-stage development.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24 | $0.01 B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -0.18 | $0.01 B      |
| 2024-05-10 | -0.19 | $0.01 B      |
| 2023-11-09 | -0.22 | $0.01 B      |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.22 | $0.01 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains flat at approximately $0.01B across quarters, while the profit margin fluctuates.  The Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, reflecting the company's significant losses. The negative ROE and negative EPS suggest the company is not yet profitable.  This is typical for early-stage technology companies like IONQ.

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE     |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|---------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.01B  | 56.92%        | $0.38B | -52.62% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ exhibits high growth potential in the quantum computing sector, but it's crucial to acknowledge the significant risks involved. The company is currently unprofitable, and its stock price shows extreme volatility. While past performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, this is not a guarantee of future returns.  The high beta implies substantial market risk.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in IONQ.  More detailed fundamental analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's technology, competitive landscape, and long-term business plan, is needed to make a well-informed investment decision.
