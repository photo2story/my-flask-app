**0) Data Summary**

*   **Ticker:** IONQ
*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc is a quantum computing company.
*   **Current Price:** $41.67
*   **Return vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**  IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Moving Averages:**  5-day SMA is below 20-day and 60-day SMAs.

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Cumulative Return (IONQ):** 290.64%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 42.66%
*   **Divergence (IONQ vs. VOO):** 248.0 (Relative Divergence: 65.8)

**Analysis:** IONQ has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500.  The relative divergence of 65.8 suggests that the current outperformance is in the middle of its historical range compared to the VOO. It is neither at its all-time high nor at its all-time low compared to VOO.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
    |------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
    | 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3%  | 83.0%   | -0.0   | 4.4    |
    | 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 82.3%  | 188.0%  | -0.0   | 14.8   |
    | 2023-2025  | 297.0% | 79.6%  | 238.0%  | 0.0    | 14.8   |

    **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is extremely high, indicating very strong growth.
    *   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown is also high, highlighting significant volatility. This means the stock price can experience substantial drops.
    *   **Alpha:** The high Alpha values suggest the stock is generating returns *above* what would be expected based on market movements. This could indicate superior performance.
    *   **Beta:** Beta near 0 suggests the stock's price is not very correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This can be good for diversification but also means it might not benefit as much from broad market rallies.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Cap is shown in billions of dollars.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** $41.67
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 41.71, 'previousClose': 41.0, 'change': 1.73}
*   **5-day SMA:** 45.49
*   **20-day SMA:** 53.40
*   **60-day SMA:** 59.30

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently *below* all three moving averages.  This suggests a recent downtrend. The 5-day SMA being below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs confirms this. The recent modest price increase suggests a small rebound, but the overall trend is still down.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 27.52
*   **PPO:** -2.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell (80% of holdings)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (Negative: Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 38.2

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium MRI suggests a moderate level of risk, balancing potential reward with possible losses.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 30, indicating the stock is *oversold*. This *could* signal a potential buying opportunity if the stock is fundamentally sound.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests a downtrend, confirming what the moving averages indicate.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The "Sell 80% of holdings" signal strongly suggests caution.
*   **Divergence Change:** A negative divergence change suggests the recent outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is diminishing.
*   **Expected Return:** A 38.2% expected return is very high and optimistic, especially given the other indicators. This should be taken with a grain of salt.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines present a mixed picture:

*   **Negative/Cautious:** J.P. Morgan staying on the sidelines, stock dip after Q3, tumbling stock, Buffett preferring other quantum stocks.
*   **Positive/Neutral:** Investing in Quantum's Next Wave, What's Happening With IONQ.

**Analysis:** Recent news is mixed, with a slight bias towards negative sentiment due to Q3 performance and analyst/investor concerns. This seems to be contributing to the recent price decline. The reference to Buffett is important, as his investment decisions carry significant weight.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.78)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 72.35 / 100.00 / 47.00

**Analysis:** While the analyst consensus is "Buy," the target prices suggest considerable upside potential from the current price. However, the recent negative news and price decline might lead to future revisions.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

*   **Equity and ROE:** Equity is growing, suggesting successful fundraising or asset accumulation.  However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is *strongly negative*, reflecting the significant losses the company is incurring.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk stock in the promising but still nascent quantum computing sector.

**Strengths:**

*   **Significant outperformance vs. the S&P 500** (though recent divergence change is negative).
*   **Strong CAGR and Alpha**, indicating market-beating performance.
*   **High profit margins** on revenue when revenue is realized.
*   **Increasing revenue** (though from a low base).
*   **"Buy" analyst consensus** and high target prices.
*   **Growing equity**

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Very high volatility** (high MDD).
*   **Unprofitable** with significantly negative EPS and ROE.
*   **Recent price decline** and negative short-term trends (SMAs, PPO, divergence change).
*   **Recent negative news sentiment**.
*   **Hybrid signal recommends selling 80%**.
*   **Oversold RSI is not necessarily a buy signal if fundamentals are weak**.

**Conclusion:**

IONQ is a *speculative* investment. It has the potential for very high returns but also carries a significant risk of losses. While the analyst consensus and long-term growth potential are appealing, the current financial performance and recent negative trends warrant caution.  The high level of volatility and the fact that it's oversold doesn't automatically make it a good buy. Investors should carefully weigh their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in IONQ. The very high expected return should be viewed with skepticism until the company shows a clear path to profitability.
