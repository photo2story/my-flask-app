| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0% | 72.8% | 71.0% | 0.1 | 3.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 199.0% | 72.8% | 178.0% | 0.0 | 10.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 252.0% | 67.0% | 233.0% | 0.1 | 7.8 |

The table shows extremely high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR), indicating strong growth.  However, the high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight significant risk. The Alpha values are generally high, suggesting excess returns beyond what's expected based on market performance (Beta), while the Beta values fluctuate, implying varying sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $31.84
* **Last Market Price:** $31.27 (a decrease of $1.79 or 5.62%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $30.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $27.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $26.23

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the recent drop indicates some caution is warranted.

**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 68.92 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.43 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +14.6% (Short-term upward trend)


The recent price drop of $1.79 reflects a minor downturn. While indicators suggest bullish momentum, the RSI nearing overbought levels and the recent price dip warrant caution. The positive 20-day relative divergence change suggests a short-term upward trend. The high expected return, however, remains promising for long-term investors.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-05-07 | -$0.14   | $0.01 B       |
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.24   | $0.01 B       |
| 2024-08-07 | -$0.18   | $0.01 B       |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.19   | $0.01 B       |
| 2025-05-07 | -$0.19   | $0.01 B       |

The company consistently reports negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  Revenue remains relatively flat at around $0.01B per quarter.  This suggests that despite strong stock performance, the company's underlying profitability needs significant improvement.  The repeated -$0.19 entries require clarification to confirm accuracy.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $0.01B | 42.97%       |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B | 56.92%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.01B | 47.46%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.01B | 50.59%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.01B | 54.97%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-03-31 | $0.77B | -4.22%       |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B | -52.62%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B | -12.05%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B | -8.11%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B | -8.25%       |

Profit margins show some variability but generally remain positive, despite negative EPS.  However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, raising concerns about the company's efficiency in using shareholder equity to generate profits.  Further investigation into the discrepancies between profit margins and ROE is needed.  The significant fluctuation in Equity from quarter to quarter also warrants further scrutiny.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ's stock performance has been exceptionally strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this performance is not yet reflected in the company's profitability, as indicated by consistently negative EPS and ROE.  The high MDD values highlight the inherent risk in this investment.  While long-term prospects based on the expected return appear positive, investors should be aware of the considerable risk involved.  Further due diligence is crucial, particularly concerning the reasons behind the negative ROE and the fluctuating equity figures, before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into the company's business model and future growth plans is essential for a comprehensive evaluation.
