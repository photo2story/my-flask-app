The Alpha and Beta values indicate substantial excess returns (Alpha) with little to no correlation with the market (Beta close to 0).

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 41.67
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 41.71, Previous Close: 41.0, Change: 1.73 (small positive change)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 45.49
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 53.40
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 59.30

**Analysis:**

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short-to-medium term. The 5-day moving average is the closest to the current price, but still higher, indicating continued selling pressure. The recent small positive change of 1.73 is a limited increase that doesn't significantly alter the overall bearish trend implied by the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 27.52 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -2.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell 80.0% of holdings (3082 shares - Risky - MRI:0.50) (Cash Ratio: 80% on 2025-10-16)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.8 (Decreasing)
*   **Expected Return:** 38.2% (vs. S&P 500 over 2+ years with regular investment)

**Analysis:**

The RSI indicates that the stock is currently oversold, which could lead to a potential bounce. However, the PPO being negative supports the bearish outlook suggested by the moving averages. The MRI is at 0.8, indicating medium investment, and the hybrid signal recommending selling 80% of holdings confirms that the system views IONQ as risky and needing to increase cash holdings.  The decreasing relative divergence confirms the short-term price decrease. The expected return is attractive, but is a long-term projection and does not factor in any losses that may occur in the short-term.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| 2025-09-30 | \$0.04B   | 46.69%        |
| 2025-06-30 | \$0.02B   | 59.76%        |
| 2025-03-31 | \$0.01B   | 42.97%        |
| 2024-12-31 | \$0.01B   | 56.92%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE       |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| 2025-09-30 | \$2.27B   | -46.41%   |
| 2025-06-30 | \$1.16B   | -15.22%   |

| 2024-09-30 | \$0.44B   | -12.05%   |

**Analysis:**

Revenue is increasing, and the profit margin is high, which is a positive sign, but does not represent overall profitability. Equity has also increased significantly, but the negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating profits from its equity base. The volatile ROE also shows that the company has an unstable profitability.

**7. Overall Assessment**

IONQ presents a complex investment picture. It has shown exceptional growth and outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial risk.

**Key Positives:**

*   High growth potential in the quantum computing market.
*   Strong revenue growth.
*   Positive analyst consensus.
*   High expected return (long-term).

**Key Negatives:**

*   High volatility and MDD.
*   Negative earnings and ROE.
*   Mixed news sentiment with warnings of potential overvaluation.
*   Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback.
*   Increasing competition in the quantum computing field.

**Conclusion:**

IONQ is a high-risk, high-reward investment. Investors should be aware of the potential for significant losses. A cautious approach is warranted, given the mixed signals from news, technical indicators, and financial data. The hybrid signal suggesting selling 80% of holdings is a strong warning sign. While the long-term potential of quantum computing is undeniable, IONQ's profitability and valuation remain concerns. This stock is suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.
