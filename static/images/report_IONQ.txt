**1. Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company.  Its stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The cumulative return of 186.79% is substantially higher than the S&P 500's 13.48%, resulting in a large divergence of 173.3%. While the relative divergence of 64.3% highlights IONQ's strong performance relative to its historical volatility against the S&P 500, it's crucial to note this is relative and does not guarantee future success.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and risk (high Beta values) associated with IONQ's stock.  While CAGR is high, the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant potential for substantial losses.  The changing Beta values suggest shifting market sensitivities over time.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 93.0% | 72.8% | 71.0% | 3.0   |       |
| 2022-2024  | 199.0% | 72.8% | 178.0% | 10.0  |       |
| 2023-2025  | 188.0% | 67.0% | 177.0% | 6.2   |       |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $25.74
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $25.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $24.1455
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $29.0152

The price is currently below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend.  However, the recent price increase (4.76%) indicates a short-term upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.14 (Slightly above neutral, not overbought)
* **PPO:** 2.06 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 26.5% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 expected)

The recent 4.76% price increase suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but the negative relative divergence change and price being below the 60-day MA hint at a possible correction.  The positive PPO and relatively low MRI suggest the potential for further growth, especially considering the high expected return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

IONQ is currently reporting negative EPS, indicating losses. Revenue remains relatively flat.  This is typical for a company in the early stages of development and commercialization in the quantum computing space.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this trajectory.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24  | $0.01 B     |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, though profit margins show some fluctuation.  The most concerning aspect is the negative Return on Equity (ROE), indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investment.  Further investigation into the reasons for this negative ROE is required.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.01B | 56.92%        |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ has demonstrated exceptional growth compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with significant risk as indicated by high Beta and MDD.  The company is currently unprofitable, and the negative ROE raises concerns about long-term sustainability.  While the expected return is high, investors should carefully consider the inherent risks associated with investing in a high-growth, high-risk technology company like IONQ. Further due diligence, including a thorough review of the company's financial statements and future prospects, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions. The short-term price movements suggest potential volatility, and investors should monitor the market closely.
