**Alpha, Beta analysis Table Analysis:**

The provided table shows annualized performance metrics over rolling three-year periods.

|            | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%    | 82.3%    | 83.0%    | -0.0   | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0%   | 82.3%    | 188.0%   | -0.0   | 14.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 323.0%   | 79.6%    | 256.0%   | 0.0    | 18.3   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows phenomenal growth rates, increasing dramatically each year. This highlights significant potential but also suggests high volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates substantial risk, with MDDs consistently around 80%. This highlights how much the stock's price has fallen from peak to trough during each period.
*   **Alpha:** Shows very high Alpha values, indicating significant outperformance relative to a benchmark index.
*   **Beta:** Beta is near zero, suggesting that IONQ's price movements are largely independent of the overall market (S&P 500). This may reflect that IonQ belongs to cutting-edge technology sector and also implies IonQ's inherent risks and opportunities are different from the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization is increasing each year, reflecting increasing investor confidence or capital raises.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Analysis:** The stock price has recently decreased (change of -5.07% relative to the previous close). The 5-day SMA is above the current price, suggesting short-term downward momentum. The 20-day SMA is below the current price, suggesting a potential recent upward trend over a slightly longer period. The 60-day SMA is well above the current price, indicating a longer-term downward trend. The recent price drop needs to be considered in the context of these moving averages.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 indicates a "Medium Investment" recommendation based on this indicator alone.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 55.88 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 2.45 indicates a positive trend, as the short-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" signals a strong buy recommendation, with a strategy for monthly investment. This suggests an optimistic outlook.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Positive divergence change (+14.2) suggests short-term upward momentum.
*   **Recent Price Fluctuation:** The large recent price change (-5.07%) reflects high volatility.
*   **Expected Return:** 29.8% is a very high expected excess return, reflecting the potential but also the risk associated with this investment.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Analysis:** The news headlines are a mix of optimistic and cautionary. Several articles discuss IonQ's potential for future growth ("Millionaire-Maker Stock," "Fresh Breakout"). However, others highlight warnings and risks ("$926 Million Warning"). The articles emphasize the volatility and uncertainty in the quantum computing sector.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Buy," with a mean rating of 1.78. The target price range is wide (from \$47 to \$100), reflecting differing opinions and the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future performance.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | -3.58  | 0.04 B\$  |
| 2025-08-06 | -0.7   | 0.02 B\$  |
| 2025-05-07 | -0.14  | 0.01 B\$  |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.24  | 0.01 B\$  |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.24  | 0.01 B\$  |

*   **Analysis:** The company is currently unprofitable, as evidenced by the negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) figures. Revenue is growing but remains relatively small. The significant jump in negative EPS in the most recent quarter (2025-11-05) warrants further investigation. The increase in revenue from 0.01 B$ to 0.04 B$ in the most recent data point is a positive sign. Note that 2 rows have the same date - this could be an error in the data.

**6) Financial Information**

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE       |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | \$2.27B | -46.41%   |
| 2025-06-30   | \$1.16B | -15.22%   |

| 2024-09-30   | \$0.44B | -12.05%   |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue is growing slowly. Profit margins are relatively high, suggesting that the company can generate good profit from its sales, but it is not yet sufficient to offset operating costs. Equity has increased significantly, possibly due to capital raises. ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, reflecting the company's current lack of profitability. The ROE is concerning and highlights the company's struggles to generate profits from its equity base.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

IONQ is a high-growth, high-risk quantum computing company. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but this has come with substantial volatility, as evidenced by the high MDD figures. Recent news and analyst opinions are mixed, reflecting the uncertainty in this emerging sector. While the analyst consensus is "Buy," the wide target price range highlights the divergent views on the company's future prospects.

Technically, the stock shows recent downward momentum, despite a longer period of short-term upward movement. The Hybrid Signal suggests a strong buy based on a multi-factor model.

The company is currently unprofitable, and although revenue is growing, expenses are outpacing revenue generation, resulting in negative EPS and ROE.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Investing in IONQ is highly speculative. The company shows strong growth potential, but also significant risk. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing. The high expected return reflects the potential rewards, but also the significant possibility of losses.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **High Volatility:** Be prepared for significant price swings.
*   **Unprofitability:** The company is not yet profitable.
*   **Emerging Sector:** The quantum computing sector is still in its early stages, and its future is uncertain.
*   **Cash Burn:** Monitor the company's cash burn rate and its ability to raise additional capital if needed.
