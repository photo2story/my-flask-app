2025-11-28 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of IONQ's performance and outlook based on the provided data, followed by an overall summary.

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO) Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** IONQ Inc is a quantum computing company.
*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 297.56%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 47.28%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current:** 248.0
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 65.8

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) during the tracked period. The current divergence of 248.0 indicates a substantial performance gap.  The relative divergence of 65.8 suggests that the current outperformance, while strong, is somewhat in the middle range compared to its past performance fluctuations against VOO.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3%  | 83.0%  | -0.0 | 4.4 |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 82.3%  | 188.0% | -0.0 | 14.8 |
| 2023-2025  | 304.0% | 79.6%  | 240.0% | 0.0 | 16.6 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  IONQ has experienced extremely high CAGR over the given periods, demonstrating significant growth. The CAGR is increasing each year.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD values are high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** The high alpha values suggest that IONQ's performance is largely independent of market movements (S&P 500) and driven by company-specific factors. The positive alpha is a clear indication of superior performance than the benchmark index.
*   **Beta:** Beta is essentially 0. This indicates that IONQ's price is not very correlated with the overall market. This reinforces the idea that IONQ's performance is driven by its own specific factors rather than broad market trends.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap (in Billions), has increased significantly each year.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 47.05
*    **Last-market:** {'price': 46.9, 'previousClose': 47.06, 'change': -0.34}
*   **5-day SMA:** 44.87
*   **20-day SMA:** 52.10
*   **60-day SMA:** 59.44

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price has recently fallen slightly (47.05 to 46.9).

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 38.32
*   **PPO:** -1.05
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell 80.0% of holdings (3082 shares - Risky - MRI:0.50) (Cash Ratio: 80% on 2025-10-16)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 38.2

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** While the overall market risk is medium, the MRI associated with the hybrid signal is lower (0.50), indicating a higher risk at that specific decision point.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 38.32 suggests that the stock is approaching oversold conditions, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, but requires further confirmation.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates a bearish (negative) trend in the stock's price.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal to sell 80% of holdings and move to 80% cash indicates a cautious stance based on the algorithm's assessment of risk.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence reinforces the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** Despite the recent downturn, the expected return of 38.2% remains high, suggesting potential for long-term growth.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**
