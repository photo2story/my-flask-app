Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. Monitor recent news and company announcements to assess the potential impact on the stock. Consider the hybrid signal's recommendation to reduce holdings and increase the cash position, and closely observe the company's next earnings report to evaluate its financial performance.
