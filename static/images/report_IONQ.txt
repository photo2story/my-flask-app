2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of IONQ's performance based on the data provided, followed by a comprehensive analysis:

**1) Return Rate & Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** IONQ Inc
*   **Overview:** IONQ Inc is a quantum computing company.
*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 271.10%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 46.96%
*   **Divergence:** 220.9 (Relative Divergence: 59.4)

**Analysis:**  IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period. The divergence is substantial, indicating a high level of relative outperformance. However, the relative divergence of 59.4 suggests that the current level of outperformance is roughly in the middle of the range of its historical fluctuation compared to the S&P 500. It's neither at its peak nor its trough relative to its past performance.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3%  | 83.0%   | -0.0  | 4.4    |
| 2022-2024  | 208.0% | 82.3%  | 188.0%  | -0.0  | 14.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 278.0% | 79.6%  | 214.0%  | 0.0  | 16.4   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Shows extremely high growth rates, indicating rapid expansion, although this may not be sustainable in the long term.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown suggests the stock is volatile and prone to significant price declines.
*   **Alpha:**  Extremely high alpha values (particularly in recent periods) show that IONQ's returns far exceed what would be expected based on market movements, meaning the stock is generating returns independent of the market.
*   **Beta:** A beta close to zero indicates IONQ's price is theoretically uncorrelated with the S&P 500. This isn't necessarily good or bad, but it means it might not move in tandem with the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** The increasing market capitalization indicates growing investor interest and confidence (at least in the past).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 46.44
*   **Last-market Change:** +1.29
*   **5-day SMA:** 47.68
*   **20-day SMA:** 48.71
*   **60-day SMA:** 57.72

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. The recent positive change in the last market might signal a possible short-term rebound.

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -9.9 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 48.0% (Long-term, excess return vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.7 indicates medium investment recommendation.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 50, indicating that the stock isn't overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:**  A negative PPO suggests the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, indicating a possible downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends full investment with a moderate monthly addition, suggesting a bullish long-term outlook.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence indicates recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:**  The high expected return suggests analysts believe in IONQ's long-term potential.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Canada Quantum Computing Funding:** Canada's investment in quantum computing could impact the competitive landscape.
*   **Jefferies Buy Rating:** A "Buy" rating and $100 price target from Jefferies is a positive signal.
*   **Competition & Insider Sales:** Competition fears and insider sales can create liquidity grab.
*   **Stock Drop:** Why IonQ stock falling today.

*   **ROE:**  Negative ROE reflects the company's unprofitability. While improving in some quarters, the recent sharp decrease is concerning.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

IONQ is a high-growth, but currently unprofitable, quantum computing company. It has significantly outperformed the market in the past, evidenced by its high alpha and cumulative return compared to the S&P 500. However, the stock is very volatile, as indicated by the large MDD.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Growth Potential:** The quantum computing industry is in its early stages, and IONQ has the potential for significant growth.
*   **Unprofitability:** The company is currently losing money, and it is uncertain when it will become profitable. High negative EPS is alarming.
*   **Valuation:** The stock's valuation is likely based on future potential rather than current earnings.
*   **Competition:**  The quantum computing space is becoming more competitive, which could put pressure on IONQ's market share and profitability.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analyst sentiment is mostly positive.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Technical indicators are mixed, with some suggesting a short-term downtrend.
*   **Market Risk Indicator:** The MRI indicates a medium level of investment risk.

**Overall Recommendation:**

IONQ is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The company has the potential to be a leader in the quantum computing industry, but it faces significant challenges. If you're risk-averse, this stock might not be suitable for you. If you have a high-risk tolerance and believe in the long-term potential of quantum computing, IONQ could be a worthwhile investment. Careful monitoring of financial performance, competitive landscape, and technological advancements will be crucial. The high degree of volatility requires careful risk management.
