**6) Overall Conclusion:**

IONQ exhibits high growth potential in the emerging quantum computing sector.  However, it's crucial to acknowledge the significant volatility and currently unprofitable nature of the business.  The substantial outperformance against the S&P 500 in certain periods is countered by a projected negative long-term expected return relative to the benchmark.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with this stock before investing, and the negative ROE suggests it's unlikely to become profitable anytime soon. Further investigation into the reasons behind recent price surges and the long-term sustainability of the business model is warranted.  The relatively high valuation should also be a significant concern.
