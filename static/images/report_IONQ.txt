**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent price action indicates a potential bearish trend.  Negative EPS, despite relatively high profit margins, and negative ROE paint a concerning picture of the company's financial health. While the long-term expected return is high,  the high risk associated with IONQ (indicated by high Beta, MRI, and recent price volatility) necessitates a cautious approach.  Further due diligence, including an analysis of the company's future growth prospects and potential for profitability, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistencies in reported data (duplicate earnings entry) require clarification.
