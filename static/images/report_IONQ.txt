The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant growth, especially from 2022-2024. However, the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial risk.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $25.72
* **20-day Moving Average:** $19.01
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.03

The stock price is significantly above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent strong upward trend.  This is a clear indication of a rapid price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 74.39 (Overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 3.12 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 70.46 (+)  Short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -0.01% (This suggests a slightly negative expected return over the very short term, but this number needs additional context, such as time horizon.)


The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction. The positive PPO confirms the upward momentum, but the RSI suggests caution.  The significantly positive Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence strengthens the indication of a recent sharp uptrend.  The negative expected return is likely short-term and doesn't negate the long-term potential given the significant outperformance over the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.24 | $0.01 B      |
| 2024-08-07 | -$0.18 | $0.01 B      |

| 2024-11-06 | -$0.22 | $0.01 B      |

The company is currently unprofitable, with consistently negative EPS. Revenue remains relatively flat around $0.01B.  Further analysis is needed to assess the financial performance against expectations.  The lack of year-over-year growth in revenue despite significant stock price gains is a point of concern that needs to be considered against any future investment decision.

**6. Financial Information:**

**1) Revenue and Profitability:**  Profit margins fluctuate but generally high, although revenue remains low.

**8. Summary:**

IONQ has shown exceptional growth compared to the S&P 500, with a significantly higher cumulative return.  However, this performance comes with considerable risk, as evidenced by the high MDD and beta.  The company is currently unprofitable with flat revenue, and the high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought. While the short-term expected return is slightly negative, the long-term potential, contingent on the company's ability to achieve profitability and sustain its growth,  could be considerable given its outperformance of the S&P 500 over the longer term. Further investigation into the recent news and analyst opinions, and an in-depth analysis of the company's financials, business model, and future prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
