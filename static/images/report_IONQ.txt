Okay, here's an analysis of IONQ based on the provided data.  I'll present the information in English with numbers first, followed by a concise analysis.

**Report on IONQ Inc.**

**Company Overview:** IONQ Inc. is a quantum computing company focused on developing trapped ion quantum computers.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 406.83%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 44.29%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** 320.0
*   **Relative Divergence:** 87.2 (Indicates IONQ's outperformance is in the 87.2th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.)

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%    | 82.3%    | 83.0%    | -0.0    | 3.5    |

**Analysis:** IONQ has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period. The large positive alpha values indicate substantial returns above what would be expected based on market movements. Beta values close to zero suggest IONQ's returns are largely independent of overall market volatility. The high CAGR values reflect rapid growth, but so do the large MDD values(high volatility).

**2. Recent Stock Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 77.57
*    **Last Market Data:** {'price': 62.94, 'previousClose': 65.59, 'change': -4.04}
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 76.43
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 71.56
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 52.30

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an uptrend. However, the significant drop of -4.04 in the last market indicates recent negative price action and potential volatility.

**Analysis:**  The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. The RSI is neutral, while the PPO indicates a slightly oversold condition. The Hybrid Signal advocates for a full investment of available cash based on its model.  The negative change in relative divergence and the recent large price drop signals a potential short-term downturn.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

**Analysis:** Revenue is growing slowly and profit margins are high but the company is still reporting negative ROE and losses. Equity has increased substantially, potentially due to capital raises.

**7. 종합 Analysis (Summary)**

IONQ has demonstrated exceptional historical returns compared to the S&P 500, driven by strong revenue growth (albeit from a low base) and the high future potential of quantum computing. However, the company is currently unprofitable with significant negative earnings and ROE.

*   **Positive Factors:** High growth potential, significant outperformance of the market, positive analyst consensus (though with price target uncertainty), strong revenue growth, and a decent equity position.
*   **Negative Factors:** High volatility (MDD), recent negative price action, negative earnings and ROE, analyst target price below the current price, news articles highlighting potential overvaluation, dependence on external funding (capital raises).

**Overall Assessment:**

IONQ is a high-risk, high-reward investment. Its strong historical performance and potential for disruption in the quantum computing space are attractive. However, the lack of profitability, high volatility, and recent price drop warrant caution. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing in IONQ. The recent market downturn suggests potential profit-taking after the company's substantial run-up. The news sentiment indicates a need for caution due to valuation concerns.
