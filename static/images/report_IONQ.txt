**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------- |
| 2025-09-30   | $0.04B  | 46.69%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.02B  | 59.76%        |

| 2024-12-31   | $0.01B  | 56.92%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.01B  | 47.46%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity | ROE       |
| ------------ | ------ | --------- |
| 2025-09-30   | $2.27B | -46.41%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.16B | -15.22%   |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.77B | -4.22%    |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.44B | -12.05%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**
    *   Revenue is increasing over time, albeit from a small starting point. This indicates growth in the company's business.
    *   Profit margins are relatively high for a growth company, indicating strong pricing power or efficient cost management.  However, this must be considered in the context of the overall unprofitability (negative EPS).
*   **Capital and Profitability:**
    *   Equity is increasing significantly, which likely reflects capital raises and/or reinvestment of revenue. This indicates the company is attracting investment and growing its asset base.
    *   ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, confirming that the company is currently unprofitable. The highly negative ROE means the equity is actually shrinking.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

IONQ presents a complex picture:

*   **High Growth Potential:** IONQ operates in the emerging quantum computing industry and shows the high CAGR in recent Alpha/Beta analysis. The growth is demonstrated in the revenue.
*   **High Risk:** The negative EPS, volatile stock price, significant MDD, and negative ROE all indicate substantial risk.  The "Moon Shot or Crash Landing?" news headline encapsulates this well.
*   **Strong Alpha and Beta:** The high Alpha indicates outperformance. The high Beta indicates high volatility.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** Mixed, but generally positive target prices suggest potential upside.
*   **Recent Downtrend:**  Technical indicators (SMAs, PPO, recent divergence change) suggest a recent downtrend.
*   **Strategic Partnerships:** Expanding partnerships signal progress in real-world applications.
*   **Financial Strength:** Revenue growth and increasing equity are positives, but unprofitability is a concern.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Investing in IONQ is highly speculative. It is suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. The potential rewards are significant, but investors should be prepared for substantial volatility and the possibility of losses. It's essential to carefully consider the company's financial performance, competitive landscape, and technological progress before investing. Diversification is key.
