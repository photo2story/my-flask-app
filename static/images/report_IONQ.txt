#### Alpha, Beta Analysis

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 84.0%  | 82.3%  | 83.0%  | -0.0  | 4.4    |

*   **CAGR:** High growth rates indicate significant potential but also imply higher risk.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values suggest substantial volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently high Alpha implies significant outperformance compared to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta near 0 suggests the stock's price is relatively independent of overall market movements.
*    **Cap(B):** The increasing capitalization over the years suggest growth in company value.

**Analysis:** The high CAGR and Alpha are attractive, but the MDD figures highlight the considerable risk involved with IONQ. A Beta near zero indicates a lack of correlation with the broader market.

### 2. Recent Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** $47.18
*   **Previous Close:** $45.40
*   **Change:** 3.92

*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 58.9312

The current price is below all moving averages (5, 20, 60 day), indicating a recent downward trend.  However, today's increase of 3.92 suggests a potential rebound.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Expectations

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 31.96 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -2.42 (Negative value suggests a downward trend in price momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_80%_Sell (Suggests a strong signal to reduce holdings significantly due to risk.)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.4 (Indicates a short-term decline in relative performance compared to the benchmark)
*   **Expected Return:** 34.2% (Long-term excess return potential vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The RSI nearing oversold levels could signal a potential buying opportunity, but the negative PPO, sell signal, and negative divergence change suggest caution.  The high expected return is encouraging, but it is a long-term projection and should be considered alongside the other risk indicators. The MRI indicates that the investment is considered at medium risk. Given the price increase from the last closing, this might reflect that the market is reacting to positive news or recovering from a previous dip.
