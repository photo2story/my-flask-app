*   **MRI:** Despite the recent price drop, the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, though this should be viewed with skepticism given other indicators.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends selling a significant portion of holdings (80%), indicating a risky outlook.
*   **Relative Divergence:** A recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term uptrend in the divergence between IONQ and the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The projected 31.4% excess return over the S&P 500, if investing now for the long term, is very optimistic but should be tempered by the high volatility and risk associated with IONQ.
