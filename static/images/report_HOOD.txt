**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Robinhood Markets Inc. is a technology company operating a commission-free brokerage platform.  HOOD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return of 82.75% compared to VOO's 10.62%. The difference of 72.1% highlights this substantial outperformance. The relative divergence of 59.1% suggests this outperformance is considerably above average compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.  However, analyzing the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different periods reveals volatility in HOOD's performance.  The Alpha values near zero suggest the returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta), though the high Beta in the 2021-2023 period highlights significant market sensitivity.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 72.8% | -23.0% | 11.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0% | 74.3% | 128.0% | 33.0 |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $40.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $41.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $47.21

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price increase of $1.05 (from $43.68) shows a short-term upward movement.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (Medium to High Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.59 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -19.2% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 significantly in the long term)


The recent price increase of $1.05 reflects a short-term upward movement but needs further observation to confirm a trend reversal. The negative expected return suggests potential underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD has shown exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500 in the past, but this performance has been volatile.  While recent earnings have exceeded expectations and the company demonstrates strong revenue and profit margins, the high Beta, negative long-term expected return, and somewhat concerning RSI and MRI suggest caution.  The current price is below key moving averages, hinting at a potentially bearish short-term trend.  Long-term investment decisions should consider the significant risks associated with HOOD's volatility and the currently projected underperformance relative to the broader market.  Further analysis including a deeper dive into the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape is needed before making any investment decisions.
