## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Brief Overview:**

Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) is a financial services company offering commission-free trading of stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies.  The following analysis summarizes provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **HOOD Cumulative Return:** 86.45%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 12.57%
* **Return Difference:** 73.9% (HOOD significantly outperformed VOO)
* **Relative Divergence:** 60.6% (This indicates HOOD's performance is in the upper 60.6th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range.  It does *not* imply a 60.6% superior performance consistently.)

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows highly variable performance, highlighting significant risk.  While recent periods show strong growth (151% and 130%), the period 2021-2023 experienced a -9% CAGR.  The beta values suggest significant market sensitivity (above 1 in most periods).  Alpha values consistently near zero indicate the performance is primarily driven by market movements, with limited outperformance attributable to specific company performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $44.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $41.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.46

The recent price of $44.66 shows a significant jump from the previous close ($42.09, a 6.11% increase), exceeding the short-term moving averages. However, it remains below the 60-day moving average, suggesting potential resistance at higher levels.  The jump is a significant short-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 52.93 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 1.34 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +2.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -18.6% (This suggests potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite the recent strong price movement.)  This negative expected return, despite high recent growth, strongly suggests a careful approach to long-term investment. The recent significant price jump should be treated cautiously as it doesn't negate the underlying forecast.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-12 | $0.54   | $0.4184      | $0.1216     |
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17   | $0.18        | -$0.01      |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21   | $0.15        | $0.06       |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18   | $0.06        | $0.12       |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.03   | $0.0074      | $0.0226     |

Earnings have shown significant variability and occasional positive surprises.  The most recent quarter (Feb 2025) shows substantial beating of expectations. However, reliance on a single data point is risky. Consistent outperformance needs to be observed over several quarters before drawing confident conclusions.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.01B    | 85.80%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B    | 81.00%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68B    | 81.96%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.62B    | 81.23%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.47B    | 78.13%       |

Revenue growth is observable, although not consistently strong. Profit margins remain high throughout the period, suggesting efficient operations.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $7.97     | 11.49   |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.21     | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.12     | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88     | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.70     | 0.45    |

Equity has steadily increased, and ROE has shown significant fluctuation.  The recent quarter's high ROE (11.49%) is a positive sign, but needs further confirmation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD's recent performance has been strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this should be viewed cautiously in light of the highly variable historical performance, relatively high risk (as indicated by beta and MDD â€“ Maximum Drawdown), and a negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500.  While recent earnings and revenue figures are positive, consistent outperformance needs to be demonstrated over a longer period.  The high profit margins are a positive indicator.  Overall, further observation is necessary before making strong investment recommendations.  The recent price jump warrants caution; a long-term investment decision should not be made based solely on short-term price movements.  Consider the high risk and potential for underperformance relative to the broader market.
