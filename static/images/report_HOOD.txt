## Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) Stock Review

This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), a commission-free brokerage app offering investment and trading services.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

HOOD's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.

* **HOOD Cumulative Return:** 330.71%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 39.15%
* **Return Difference:** 291.6% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns;  the relative divergence indicates this difference is at the 91st percentile of historical differences between the two assets.)

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility and inconsistent performance across different periods.  While showing incredibly high CAGR in certain years (230% and 357%),  the beta fluctuates wildly suggesting high sensitivity to market movements.  Alphas near zero suggest returns have generally tracked the market, despite the impressive cumulative returns. The large swings in Beta and CAGR imply significant risk.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 14.1% | 5.0% | 11.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0% | 16.6% | 197.0% | 33.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 357.0% | 16.6% | 294.0% | 53.5 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $60.44
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $59.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $53.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $44.28

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.9 – Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70).
* **PPO:** 0.89 – Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.0% –  Short-term downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -1.0% –  Suggests potential underperformance against the S&P 500 in a long-term (2+ years) time horizon for a buy-and-hold strategy.  This is a crucial point to consider against the impressive past performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

HOOD has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  This positive surprise is notable, however, it's crucial to consider the substantial variability in EPS figures between quarters and years.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-02-12 | 1.01   | 0.4184       |
| 2024-10-30 | 0.17   | 0.18         |
| 2024-08-07 | 0.21   | 0.15         |
| 2024-05-08 | 0.18   | 0.06         |
| 2024-02-13 | 0.03   | 0.0074       |


**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available, limiting a complete financial analysis.  This lack of data significantly hinders a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial health and sustainability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD exhibits high volatility and significant swings in performance.  While past cumulative returns are impressive and recent earnings have exceeded expectations, several key concerns emerge:

* **High Beta:**  Indicates significant market sensitivity and risk.
* **Inconsistent Performance:** CAGR and Beta figures across different periods show substantial variability.
* **Lack of Key Financial Data:** Absence of total revenue and gross profit data prevents thorough fundamental analysis.
* **Negative Long-Term Expected Return (relative to VOO):**  Despite the short-term successes, the -1% expected return relative to the S&P 500 indicates the current valuation may be too high for a long-term investment strategy based on current data.

Investors should exercise caution, thoroughly investigate the company's fundamentals once more complete data becomes available, and carefully consider the high risk associated with HOOD before making any investment decisions. The past performance, while impressive, is not indicative of future results, especially given the volatile nature highlighted in the provided data.
