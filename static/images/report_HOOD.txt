## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) is a financial services company offering brokerage services and investing platforms.

The cumulative return of HOOD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between HOOD and VOO is 264.85% - 39.50% = 225.35%.  Based on the provided data, the relative divergence is 100%, indicating HOOD's performance is at the highest point in the historical range compared to VOO.  However, it's crucial to remember that this relative divergence is based on the historical range and doesn't guarantee future performance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta values are inconsistent across different periods.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and large alpha values in 2022-2025 are unusual given the negative alpha in 2021-2023, suggesting potential data inconsistency or issues with the calculation methodology.  A beta consistently around 45 indicates high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  A deeper dive into the methodology and data quality is necessary.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD (%) | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0%     | 50.0%   | 5.0%   | 45.0  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 216.0%   | 36.8%   | 195.0% | 45.0  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 308.0%   | 32.2%   | 234.0% | 45.0  |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $50.36
* **Last Market Price:** $51.01
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $48.95
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $42.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $37.07

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend, although the price movement shows a recent day-to-day jump.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 83.01 – This indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.94 –  A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (-) -  Shows a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -1.2% -  This indicates a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). The recent price jump is notable, and needs to be considered, but on its own, doesn't change the long term prediction.

The price jump of $1.30 from the previous close suggests a recent sharp upward move, possibly indicating a short-term surge or a reaction to some news, but this alone is not enough to definitively say if it is a 급반등 (sudden surge) or a temporary change before a pullback based solely on this data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

HOOD has shown significant variability in EPS (Earnings Per Share) results compared to expectations. While there have been positive surprises (e.g., Q2 2024), there have also been instances of substantial underperformance (e.g., Q4 2023 and Q1 2024). This suggests earnings are not consistently meeting or exceeding expectations.

| 2024-10-30 | $0.17   | $0.18        | -$0.01      |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable,  hovering around $0.6B in the last three quarters. However, profit margins were significantly lower in Q4 2023 compared to other quarters suggesting potential issues within that period.

The high profit margins observed in recent quarters are notable, but further analysis is needed to evaluate sustainability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD's performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, exhibiting high volatility. However, the provided data reveals inconsistencies and raises concerns regarding data reliability and the sustainability of its performance.  The high RSI suggests an overbought condition, while the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises doubts about its long-term prospects.  The erratic earnings reports and volatile ROE further highlight the uncertainty surrounding the company's future. Further investigation is required to determine the reliability of the presented data and to perform a more comprehensive analysis.  The recent price jump needs further context to be analyzed properly.  A deeper dive into underlying business fundamentals and competitive landscape is crucial for a more informed investment decision.
