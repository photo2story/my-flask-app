### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **HOOD Cumulative Return:** 360.28%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 38.82%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** 322.1
*   **Relative Divergence:** 84.7 (Indicates HOOD's outperformance is in the upper range of its historical divergence from the S&P 500)

**Analysis:** Robinhood has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. However, the high relative divergence suggests this outperformance may be unsustainable or that HOOD is currently trading at a premium relative to its historical performance against the market.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -6.0%   | 82.5% | 0.0%   | -0.1  | 10.8   |
| 2022-2024  | 183.0%  | 82.5% | 162.0% | 0.1   | 31.5   |
| 2023-2025  | 402.0%  | 81.5% | 338.0% | 0.1   | 111.4  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows a significant increase over the three periods, from negative in 2021-2023 to extremely high in 2023-2025.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown remains consistently high, indicating a large potential for losses and high volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is very high in the most recent periods, signifying substantial outperformance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta is relatively low, close to zero, suggesting that Robinhood's stock price is not strongly correlated with the market. This could mean it is more influenced by company-specific factors.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has grown significantly, indicating increasing investor confidence.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 131.84
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 127.22, 'previousClose': 131.84, 'change': -3.5}
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 132.63
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 137.44
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 119.67

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below both its 5-day and 20-day moving averages but significantly above its 60-day moving average. This suggests a short-term downtrend but a longer-term uptrend. The recent market data showing a price of 127.22 with a change of -3.5 indicates a recent drop in price, which could be a point of concern.

### 3. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - But the Hybrid Signal is warning to Sell
*   **RSI:** 43.34 (Neutral, not overbought or oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.76 (Negative, suggesting a potential downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_80%_Sell - This is a strong signal to reduce holdings due to risk (MRI:0.50)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -7.3 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 7.6% (Over S&P 500, long-term)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but the Hybrid Signal contradicts this with a strong "Sell" recommendation. The RSI is neutral, while the negative PPO and negative change in relative divergence suggest a potential short-term downtrend. The expected return is positive, but the current signals indicate caution. The change of -3.5 in the last market price indicates a significant intraday movement, potentially driven by recent news or market sentiment.

### 7. Overall Summary

Robinhood has delivered significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by strong earnings and revenue growth. However, the recent price action, negative technical indicators (PPO, Hybrid signal), and concerning news headlines suggest potential short-term downside risk. While analysts remain generally positive, the wide range of target prices reflects uncertainty. The high relative divergence from the S&P 500 and high MDD indicate potential risk. The Hybrid Signal is currently indicating a "Sell" condition. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.
