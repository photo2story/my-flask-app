## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD), a commission-free online brokerage providing investing and financial services.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

HOOD's cumulative return (100.58%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (18.60%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 82.0%, placing it in the 64.2nd percentile of its historical range (max: 160.4%, min: -58.9%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance:

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0%  | 72.8%  | -0.0  | 11.2  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0% | 74.3%  | 0.0   | 32.9  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 144.0% | 74.3%  | -0.0  | 42.9  |        |

The high beta values (11.2-42.9) suggest HOOD's price is significantly more volatile than the overall market.  While recent years show strong CAGR, the earlier period demonstrates significant losses highlighting considerable risk. The near-zero alpha suggests limited outperformance relative to market benchmarks,  despite the high cumulative return in comparison to VOO.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $48.59
* **5-day MA:** $48.52
* **20-day MA:** $43.37
* **60-day MA:** $46.06

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 61.65 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 1.68 (Positive; suggests bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0 (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return:** -16.2% (Long-term underperformance relative to S&P 500 is predicted)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO and RSI suggest bullish momentum, the negative expected return and recent relative divergence suggest caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date        | EPS    | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|-------------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| 2025-04-30  | 0.37   | 0.3253        | Beat       |
| 2025-02-12  | 0.54   | 0.4184        | Beat       |
| 2024-10-30  | 0.17   | 0.18          | Miss       |
| 2024-08-07  | 0.21   | 0.15          | Beat       |
| 2024-05-08  | 0.18   | 0.06          | Beat       |

HOOD has consistently beaten EPS expectations in recent quarters, except for one instance.  This positive trend suggests improving profitability.


**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available, limiting a comprehensive financial assessment.  This lack of data significantly hinders a complete understanding of the company's financial health and sustainability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD shows impressive cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500, however, this is tempered by high volatility (reflected in the high beta) and a negative long-term expected return relative to the market. The recent earnings beat expectations, showing promise. However, the absence of key financial data like revenue and gross profit significantly restricts a complete analysis.  The high volatility and uncertainty warrant a cautious approach.  Investors should carefully consider the risks involved given the mixed signals from technical indicators and the incomplete financial information before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the company's financials and future growth prospects is crucial for a more informed assessment.
