2025-01-17 - Analysis Report
Here's a report summarizing the provided data on Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD).

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) is a financial services company offering commission-free trading and investment products.

The cumulative return of HOOD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 203.1 percentage points (236.17% - 33.09%). This places the HOOD performance at the 100th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, indicating extremely strong outperformance.  However,  it's crucial to note that this high relative performance may not be sustainable. The high Alpha (203%) and Beta (41) in the provided CAGR analysis suggest significant market-outperformance and volatility, respectively.


**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **Closing Price:** $46.40
* **Last Market Price:** $46.44
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $42.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $40.21
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $35.57

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates some short-term consolidation, but the price is trending strongly higher compared to the longer-term 60-day average.  The difference between the last market price and closing price is negligible.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI:** 67.22  (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.93 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +6.4% (Indicates recent short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -1.3% (This suggests that, relative to the S&P 500, long-term returns are expected to be negative. This contradicts the strong short-term performance shown earlier and requires further investigation.  There may be a discrepancy between this expected return figure and the other data.)

Given the positive momentum indicators (PPO and relative strength change), the high RSI suggests caution.  The negative expected return contradicts the high historical performance and necessitates further analysis to understand the reasons for this discrepancy.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17   | $0.18       | -$0.01     |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21   | $0.15       | $0.06      |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18   | $0.06       | $0.12      |

| 2023-11-07 | -$0.09  | -$0.1       | $0.01      |

Robinhood has shown positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters, with significantly better-than-expected results in Q2 and Q1 2024. The most recent quarter (Q3 2024) shows a slight miss of expectations. This recent positive trend in earnings is a significant positive indicator, yet it does not entirely explain the massive previous performance divergence against the S&P 500.

| 2024-09-30  | $7.21       | 2.08    |

| 2023-09-30  | $6.57       | -1.29   |

Revenue has shown stability and slight growth. Profit margins are generally high and consistent except for Q4 2023.  Equity is increasing, reflecting positive financial health.  ROE is generally positive but low, suggesting room for improvement in capital efficiency. The dramatic jump in profitability from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 needs further investigation.


**7. Overall Analysis**

HOOD has demonstrated exceptional short-term performance significantly outpacing the S&P 500. Recent earnings show positive surprises and improving profitability.  However, the long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500 which necessitates further analysis to reconcile this disparity with historical results.  Technical indicators show mixed signals, with positive momentum but an RSI approaching overbought territory. The financial statements reveal improved revenue and profitability, but ROE remains relatively modest.  Overall, the stock shows a strong short-term picture but requires more in-depth investigation into the reasons for the disparity between short-term performance and long-term return expectations.  A more detailed analysis of the business model, future prospects, and the underlying reasons for the large historical alpha would be necessary for a comprehensive investment decision.  The high Beta also highlights the significant risk involved in holding this stock.
