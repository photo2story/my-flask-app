**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

Analysis:  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant improvement from 2021-2023 to 2022-2024 and 2023-2025, indicating strong growth potential. However, the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial risk.  A beta above 1 (significantly higher than 1 in 2022-2024) suggests high volatility relative to the market.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD has shown impressive growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the reviewed period. However, the high volatility (indicated by Beta and MDD) and recent price drop highlight significant risk.  While the technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the high MRI indicates high risk. The recent earnings suggest potential for strong future performance, but significant variability exists.  A long-term investment strategy, while potentially rewarding considering the significant past outperformance, necessitates close monitoring of market conditions and the company's financial performance.  Further analysis is needed to determine a definitive long-term outlook. The sharp price drop warrants investigation into any potential underlying factors.
