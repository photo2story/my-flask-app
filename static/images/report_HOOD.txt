**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) is an American financial services company offering brokerage services and investing tools.

HOOD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return difference is a substantial 90.6 percentage points, placing it at the 68.2nd percentile of its historical range (max difference: 160.4%, min: -58.9%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance:

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0%  | 72.8%  | -0.0   | 11.0  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0% | 74.3%  | 0.0    | 32.1  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 149.0% | 74.3%  | -0.0   | 42.6  |        |

High volatility (MDD) is evident, and the Beta significantly increased over time, indicating increasing sensitivity to market movements.  The fluctuating Alpha suggests inconsistent outperformance relative to the market.  The market capitalization shows significant growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of $49.45 shows a $2.7 increase from the previous close ($48.15).  The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend, but below the 60-day moving average, indicating some potential for correction.  The 2.7 change reflects a recent upturn.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 74.54 suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating potential for a short-term correction.  The positive PPO (2.63) signals upward momentum.  The recent increase in relative divergence (13.3%) further supports the short-term upward trend. The MRI of 0.39 suggests medium risk.  However, the expected return of -14.6% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and contradicts the short term positive signals. This needs further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD exhibits strong short-term performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent earnings have exceeded expectations, and financial statements show strong revenue growth and high profit margins. However, the stock is currently overbought (RSI), and the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative, which is a significant concern.  The high volatility and fluctuating Alpha/Beta suggest inherent risk.  Investors should carefully weigh the short-term gains against the long-term outlook and consider the high volatility before making investment decisions. Further investigation into the reasons for the negative long-term expected return is crucial.
