Okay, here's an analysis of Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) based on the provided data, broken down into sections and incorporating the requested elements.

**Report on Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD)**

Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) is a financial services company offering commission-free trading of stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** HOOD
*   **Cumulative Return (HOOD):** 241.41%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 33.17%
*   **Absolute Divergence (HOOD - VOO):**
    *   Max: 236.4
    *   Min: -59.9
    *   Current: 217.9
*   **Relative Divergence:** 93.8

**Analysis:**  HOOD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period. A relative divergence of 93.8 indicates that HOOD's outperformance is near the upper end of its historical range relative to VOO.  However, this also means it's more likely to regress to the mean, and this outperformance might not be sustainable.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       |   CAGR |   MDD |   Alpha |   Beta |   Cap(B) |
|------------|-------:|------:|--------:|-------:|---------:|
| 2021-2023  |   -9   |  72.8 |   -12   |   -0.1 |     11.2 |
| 2022-2024  |  151   |  74.3 |   126   |   -0   |     32.9 |
| 2023-2025  |  285   |  74.3 |   236   |   -0   |     89.9 |

**Analysis:**  The table shows a dramatic turnaround in performance from 2021-2023 to 2023-2025. CAGR and Alpha are strongly positive in the later periods, indicating strong outperformance relative to the market. The Beta values are near zero or negative, suggesting HOOD's returns are largely independent of the overall market.  High MDD's (Maximum Drawdown) across all periods imply significant volatility and risk.  The market cap has increased significantly.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** $101.85
*   **Previous Close:** $104.34
*   **Change:** -$2.39
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 104.926
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 95.6913
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 74.3151

**Analysis:** The stock price has decreased recently.  The current price is below the 5-day moving average, indicating a short-term downward trend.  It's above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a longer-term upward trend, though weakening.  The recent price drop of $2.39 relative to the previous close is notable, signaling a potential shift in momentum.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3359 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 63.26
*   **PPO:** -0.50
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  Cash 70% / Sell 69.9% of holdings (1175 shares)
*   **Recent (20-Day) Relative Divergence Change:** -6.2 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -1.9%

**Analysis:**

*   The low MRI suggests a relatively stable market environment, but the Hybrid Signal suggests caution and recommends selling a significant portion of holdings, possibly because of the high valuation relative to its own history. The recommendation to move to 70% cash is significant.
*   The RSI of 63.26 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.
*   The negative PPO indicates the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming a short-term downtrend.
*   The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term bearish outlook.
*   The negative expected return implies that, from the current level, long-term investment might underperform the S&P 500.
*   The recent price change of -2.39 suggests a short-term downward movement.

**7. Overall Summary and Conclusion**

Robinhood (HOOD) has experienced substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but recent indicators suggest a potential shift in momentum. The stock exhibits high volatility.

*   **Positive Factors:** Strong earnings performance exceeding expectations, high profit margins, increasing revenue (though recent slight dip), and significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over a longer timeframe.
*   **Negative Factors:** Recent price decline, negative short-term trends indicated by moving averages and PPO, potentially overbought RSI, negative expected return (compared to S&P 500), and a "Sell" signal from the Hybrid Indicator. High MDD indicate the potential of high volatility.
*   **Neutral Factors:** Recent news events warrant monitoring, but their overall impact is unclear.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. The Hybrid Signal's recommendation to reduce holdings and increase cash is worth serious consideration. Investors should closely monitor upcoming earnings reports, news releases, and market sentiment to reassess the outlook for HOOD. Consider the potential for underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term, as indicated by the negative expected return.
