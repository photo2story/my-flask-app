    *   **Interpretation:** The relative spread of 86.8 indicates that the current outperformance is near the higher end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This suggests a strong recent performance, but it's important to consider if this level of outperformance is sustainable.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|----------|---------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 275.0%  | 74.3%   | 222.0%   | -0.0    | 90.0   |

*   **CAGR & MDD:**  The CAGR varies wildly depending on the starting year, highlighting volatility. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha is strongly positive in recent periods (2022-2024, 2023-2025), suggesting HOOD's performance isn't solely tied to market movements. It's generating excess returns.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is close to zero, indicating HOOD's price movements are almost uncorrelated to the S\&P500.
*   **Cap(B):**  The market capitalization has grown significantly over the analyzed periods, reflecting company growth.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 101.25

*   **Interpretation:** The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The recent price drop, as shown by the negative change, could be a reaction to recent news or market sentiment.

### 3. Technical Indicators & Hybrid Signal

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3322 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 28.96 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.32
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_69%_Sell 1.4% of holdings (7 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 69% on 2025-08-15)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -3.0 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -0.8% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   The low MRI suggests a generally low-risk environment.
    *   The RSI indicates the stock is currently oversold, which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity, but it's not a guarantee.
    *   The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, typically a bearish signal.
    *   The Hybrid Signal suggests a cautious approach: selling a small portion of holdings and increasing cash.
    *   The negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence confirms the recent short-term decline.
    *   The slightly negative expected return suggests that, from the current point, long-term investments may underperform the S&P 500. The  {'price': 101.25, 'previousClose': 102.91, 'change': -1.61} value is large which may reflect issue.
