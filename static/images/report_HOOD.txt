This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), a commission-free online brokerage offering investment and financial services.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

HOOD's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  HOOD shows a cumulative return of 247.64%, while VOO shows 29.53%.  The difference is 218.1%, placing it at the 72.2nd percentile of its historical range (max 326.7%, min -63.3%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent results across different timeframes:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                               |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|---------------------------------------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 14.1% | 5.0% | 0.0 | 11.3 | Significantly underperformed the market |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0% | 16.6% | 197.0% | -0.0 | 33.0 | Massive outperformance; high Alpha      |
| 2023-2025  | 274.0% | 16.6% | 220.0% | -0.0 | 43.2 | Continued strong outperformance      |

The highly variable performance highlights substantial volatility and potentially unsustainable growth in recent periods.  The high Alpha in the later periods suggests outperformance relative to the market, but this must be considered in light of the high volatility and past underperformance.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $48.78
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $49.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $54.40
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.03

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.  However, it is above its 60-day moving average, suggesting potential support.  The recent price change of -$0.14 (from $48.85) represents a minor decrease and does not indicate a significant, sudden shift.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.56 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -3.29 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -10.9% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -1.3% (Long-term S&P 500 outperformance expected, but  with significant uncertainty given volatility)


The technical indicators suggest bearish sentiment. The relatively small negative change in price doesn't warrant a "sharp drop" designation.  The projected long-term outperformance requires careful consideration given the significant volatility and inconsistent historical performance.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-12 | 1.01   | 0.4184        | +0.5916     |
| 2024-10-30 | 0.17   | 0.18          | -0.01       |
| 2024-08-07 | 0.21   | 0.15          | +0.06       |
| 2024-05-08 | 0.18   | 0.06          | +0.12       |
| 2024-02-13 | 0.03   | 0.0074        | +0.0226     |

HOOD has consistently exceeded expected EPS in recent quarters, demonstrating a positive surprise. The most recent quarter (2025-02-12) shows a significant positive surprise.  However, this needs to be viewed with caution given the inherent volatility in the company's performance.

| 2023-12-31 | $6.70B   | 0.45%    | -                     |

Revenue growth is highly variable, with strong growth in the most recent quarter.  Profit margins remain consistently high. ROE has fluctuated but shows a significant improvement in the last quarter.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

HOOD's performance shows extreme volatility and significant inconsistency. While recent quarters have shown substantial outperformance against the S&P 500 and impressive earnings beats,  past underperformance and the inherently volatile nature of the stock warrant caution.  The high Alpha in recent periods is encouraging, but sustainability is questionable.  Investors considering HOOD should carefully assess their risk tolerance and understand the potential for significant price swings.  The positive earnings surprises and improving financials are positive signs, but the unpredictable nature of the stock requires thorough due diligence before investment.  The long-term projected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 should be viewed with skepticism given the past performance.
