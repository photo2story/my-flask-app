## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD), a company offering commission-free trading and financial services.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Robinhood's cumulative return (270.36%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (23.13%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is substantial (247.2 percentage points), placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to note that this high relative performance is likely influenced by the relatively short time frame of the analysis and past volatility.  The provided alpha and beta analysis show highly fluctuating performance against the market.  While recent periods show incredibly high CAGR, the long term performance is far more modest.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The significant variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), alpha, and beta across different timeframes (2021-2023, 2022-2024, 2023-2025) highlights the volatility and risk associated with HOOD. The high beta values suggest substantial market sensitivity.  Further investigation is required to assess the long-term sustainability of the performance and understand the market factors that influence it.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $51.12
* **5-day moving average:** $49.96
* **20-day moving average:** $43.11
* **60-day moving average:** $37.47

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend, but the significant gap between the short-term averages and the 60-day average points to a recent acceleration in price.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 81.70  -  Indicates the stock is currently in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction might be imminent.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.84 - A positive value indicates upward momentum, consistent with the recent price movement.
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (-) - Suggests a short-term downward trend.
* **Price Change:** The recent price change shows a positive increase of $1.51, indicating a sharp upward move which might be a short-term rally and inconsistent with other indicators.
* **Expected Return:** -1.5% - This suggests a negative expected return relative to the market over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  This is counter-intuitive to recent performance and may require further investigation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17  | $0.18        | -$0.01      |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21  | $0.15        | $0.06       |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18  | $0.06        | $0.12       |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.03  | $0.006       | $0.024      |
| 2023-11-07 | -$0.09 | -$0.1        | $0.01       |

Earnings have shown significant variability. While recent quarters have surpassed expectations,  the long-term trend and future earnings projections are needed for a comprehensive evaluation.  The recent positive surprises might explain the recent sharp price increase.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64       | 81.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68       | 81.96%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.62       | 81.23%        |

| 2023-09-30 | $0.47       | 75.80%        |

Revenue shows a general upward trend, except for a slight dip in Q4 2023.  The significant increase in profit margin in 2024 requires further investigation to understand the underlying factors. The large difference in profit margin between Q4 2023 and subsequent quarters suggests a significant improvement in profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.21       | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.12       | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88       | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.70       | 0.45    |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.57       | -1.29   |

Equity is steadily increasing, indicating a healthy financial position. ROE (Return on Equity) also shows improvement in 2024 compared to 2023.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD shows significant short-term volatility and high growth, but its long-term sustainability and profitability remain questionable.  The high RSI, recent price surge, and conflicting signals from the expected return and technical indicators suggest caution.  While recent earnings and revenue figures are positive, the inconsistent performance across different timeframes and the significant fluctuations in profit margin highlight the risks involved.  A more in-depth analysis considering macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons for the sharp increase in profit margin and the discrepancy between the high short-term returns and negative long-term expected return is crucial. The extreme volatility renders simple analysis unreliable.  A thorough review of the company's business model and future plans is necessary to get a complete picture of the investment's long-term potential.
