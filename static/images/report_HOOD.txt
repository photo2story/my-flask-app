## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

HOOD's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price movement shows upward momentum, supported by improving financial metrics.  However,  a more in-depth analysis is needed to assess long-term sustainability.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) is a financial services company offering commission-free stock and cryptocurrency trading.

* **Cumulative Return Comparison:** HOOD shows a cumulative return of 298.43%, while VOO shows 34.21%.  The difference is substantial (264.2 percentage points), placing HOOD at the 99.4th percentile of its historical relative performance against VOO.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 14.1% | 5.0% | 0.0 | 11.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0% | 16.6% | 199.0% | 0.0 | 32.9 |
| 2023-2025  | 325.0% | 16.6% | 266.0% | 0.0 | 49.4 |

The alpha values are exceptionally high, suggesting significant outperformance relative to the benchmark. However, the beta near zero suggests a low correlation with the market.  The dramatic increase in CAGR and alpha from 2021-2023 to 2023-2025 warrants further investigation into the underlying drivers of this growth. The market capitalization has also grown considerably.  It's crucial to investigate the reasons behind these changes.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $55.91
* **5-day Moving Average:** $54.91
* **20-day Moving Average:** $51.40
* **60-day Moving Average:** $42.78

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. The significant gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages further emphasizes this upward momentum. The recent price change (+4.82%) indicates a substantial daily jump.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 62.37 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.17 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum, though relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -0.9% (This suggests that, while HOOD has outperformed historically, the model predicts a slight underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a longer-term investment horizon.  The large discrepancy between short-term and long-term projections warrants further investigation into the model's assumptions and limitations.)

| 2023-11-07 | -$0.09  | -$0.1        | +$0.01      |

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B    | 81.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68B    | 81.96%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.62B    | 81.23%        |

| 2023-09-30 | $0.47B    | 75.80%        |

Revenue is relatively stable, with a significant increase in profit margins, except for a drop in Q4 2023. This needs further investigation to determine the cause.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.21      | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.12      | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88      | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.70      | 0.45    |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.57      | -1.29   |

Equity is steadily increasing. ROE shows improvement, although it remains relatively low. The negative ROE in Q3 2023 requires further examination.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD's recent performance has been exceptionally strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Positive earnings surprises and improving financial metrics contribute to this strong performance. However, the long-term forecast suggests potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500, along with  some inconsistencies in the data (e.g., the substantial change in CAGR and the sharp drop in profit margin in Q4 2023).  A deeper dive into the underlying factors driving the recent growth,  the reasons behind the fluctuations in profitability, and a thorough analysis of the long-term model's assumptions are crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation is needed to determine if this outperformance is sustainable.  The high alpha values are intriguing but require careful consideration of the associated risk.
