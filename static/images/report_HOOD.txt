## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) is a commission-free brokerage platform offering investment and financial services.  The stock significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the review period, exhibiting high volatility and considerable recent price increases. While recent earnings show positive EPS surprises,  profitability metrics reveal inconsistencies, and long-term prospects remain uncertain despite a relatively positive outlook in short-term.  


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) is a commission-free brokerage platform providing investment and financial services.

* **HOOD Cumulative Return:** 100.58%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 18.60%
* **Return Difference:** 81.98%
* **Relative Divergence:** 64.2% (This indicates HOOD's performance is in the upper 64.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO, considering the range of -58.9% to 160.4%).


The provided CAGR data shows significant variability: substantial gains in 2022-2025 are preceded by a negative CAGR in 2021-2023, highlighting the risk associated with this investment.  A beta of around 11.2 (2021-2023) to 42.9 (2023-2025) indicates high volatility and significant sensitivity to market movements, with alpha close to zero, suggesting the returns are largely driven by market movements rather than company-specific factors.  This is consistent with the high relative divergence observed.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $48.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $48.52
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $43.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.06

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. The recent 4.23% price increase is notable.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 61.65 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 1.68 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0% (Slight recent weakening of relative momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -16.2% (Negative, suggesting potential underperformance against S&P 500 over the long term)

The recent significant price increase ('change': 4.23%) suggests a potential short-term uptrend.  However, the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a key concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD has shown impressive returns exceeding the S&P 500, driven by high volatility and positive EPS surprises in recent quarters.  However, the high beta, negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500, and fluctuating ROE raise significant concerns regarding risk. The company's short-term performance is encouraging, but its long-term sustainability and the consistency of its profitability remain questionable.  Further research into the drivers of recent growth and the outlook for future earnings is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A deep dive into the company's strategy and competitive landscape would also be needed for a more comprehensive analysis.
