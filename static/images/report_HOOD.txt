**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, with a substantial difference in cumulative returns. While recent earnings have shown improvement and beat expectations, the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 (-4.1%) and a slightly bearish PPO signal warrant caution. The high CAGR values are offset by the consistently zero Alpha suggesting that the high returns are explainable by market movements. Further investigation is needed into the sharp changes in profit margin and the recent market outlook before making a final investment decision.  Information regarding recent news, analyst opinions and market conditions are crucial for a complete analysis.
