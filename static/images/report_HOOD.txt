*   **CAGR:**  CAGR figures vary dramatically across the years. The periods starting in 2022 and 2023 show substantial growth (151.0% and 285.0% respectively), while the 2021-2023 period shows a negative return of -9.0%. This indicates high volatility in HOOD's performance.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, around 73-74%, which points to significant risk and large potential losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is strongly positive in the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods (126.0% and 236.0%), suggesting that HOOD's returns have significantly outperformed expectations based on market movements.  However, the 2021-2023 period has negative alpha, implying underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently near zero (-0.1 or -0.0), which suggests that HOOD's price movements have very little correlation with the overall market (S&P 500). This can be seen as both an advantage (in a market downturn) and a disadvantage (in a bull market).

### 7. Overall Analysis & Summary

Robinhood (HOOD) has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, evidenced by its high cumulative return and relative divergence. However, high MDD and nearly zero Beta suggest it moves independently of the market, which carries its own risks. Recent earnings have consistently exceeded expectations, and the company boasts strong revenue growth and high profit margins. However, the negative expected return, combined with a recent decline in relative divergence and a "Sell" hybrid signal, suggests caution is warranted. Additionally, recent news indicates potential volatility and significant developments. While the long-term analysis may not show the strength, recent price change due to market events can make short term swing trade or day trade is good.
