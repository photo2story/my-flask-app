## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), a commission-free brokerage firm, based on provided financial data.  Key performance indicators are compared against the S&P 500 (VOO) to assess relative performance and risk.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Robinhood's cumulative return (82.11%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (10.34%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 71.8 percentage points.  The relative divergence, considering historical maximum and minimum differences (162.5% and -58.6% respectively), places the current performance at the 59th percentile.  This suggests HOOD's performance is substantially above the S&P 500, but the historical volatility should be considered.


**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 72.8% | -0.0  | 11.3  | 11.3   |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0%| 74.3% | 0.0   | 33.0  | 33.0   |
| 2023-2025  | 125.0%| 74.3% | 0.0   | 39.0  | 39.0   |

The data shows significant volatility in HOOD's performance and a high beta (especially 2022-2024 and 2023-2025), indicating higher sensitivity to market movements than the overall market.  The alpha is near zero, suggesting that HOOD's returns are mostly explained by market movements.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $44.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $42.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $42.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $47.13

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  The relatively large gap between the 60-day moving average and the current price indicates a significant price drop since the beginning of June 2024.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.84 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.69 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 1.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -19.2% (This is a significant negative return and requires further investigation into its calculation and underlying assumptions.  The provided data does not specify the timeframe for the -19.2% return.)
* **Last Market Change:** A small negative daily change (-$0.14) doesn't indicate a significant event.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31  | 7.97        | 11.49   |
| 2024-09-30  | 7.21        | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30  | 7.12        | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31  | 6.88        | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31  | 6.70        | 0.45    |

Equity is growing, but ROE shows volatility, suggesting fluctuations in profitability.  The significant increase in ROE in Q4 2024 warrants further investigation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

HOOD demonstrates strong growth in revenue and consistently high-profit margins.  While the stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, its high beta indicates substantial market risk. The recent price action shows a short-term downward trend.  The consistently positive EPS surprises are encouraging.  However, the provided -19.2% expected return needs clarification regarding its calculation and timeframe. Further investigation into the drivers behind the significant Q4 2024 ROE increase is also recommended.  Long-term investors should carefully weigh the high growth potential against the significant volatility inherent in HOOD's stock.  A more comprehensive analysis incorporating additional fundamental and valuation metrics is required for a complete investment decision.
