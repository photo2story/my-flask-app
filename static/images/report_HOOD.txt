## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

HOOD's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While VOO shows a 21.65% return, HOOD boasts a 265.50% return. This substantial difference is highlighted by the high relative divergence (86.1%), indicating HOOD's performance lies in the upper percentiles of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this high relative divergence should be considered in the context of volatility shown by the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values below.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Robinhood Markets Inc. is a technology-driven financial services company providing brokerage services.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Cumulative Return Difference vs VOO |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|------------------------------------|
| 2021-2023  | 4.0% | 13.6% | 5.0% | -0.0 | 11.3 |  ~243.8%                        |
| 2022-2024  | 231.0% | 82.3% | 198.0% | 0.0 | 33.0 |  ~210%                          |
| 2023-2025  | 292.0% | 82.3% | 246.0% | 0.0 | 39.3 |  ~270%                          |


The table shows wildly varying performance across the periods.  While the initial period shows underperformance against the benchmark (negative alpha), subsequent periods demonstrate a very substantial outperformance (high positive alpha).  The beta fluctuates indicating the stock's sensitivity to market movements changes dramatically between periods. The high CAGR figures are partially offset by significant MDD which underscores the risk associated with HOOD's high growth trajectory.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $44.36
* **5-day MA:** $42.59
* **20-day MA:** $43.66
* **60-day MA:** $46.93

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent 1.6% increase (Last-market data) may represent a temporary bounce.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4247 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.22 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.61 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +11.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -0.7% (Short-term negative outlook)
* **Long-term Expected Return (vs S&P 500):**  The large positive alpha values in the table suggest potentially significant outperformance over the long term.  However, this needs cautionary consideration of the large MDD values seen, suggesting large potential future drawdowns.


The recent price increase of 1.6% indicates a minor upward bounce.  However, given the overall technical picture and negative short-term expected return, caution is warranted. The long-term potential is significant but inherently risky.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD shows a high growth trajectory with substantial outperformance against the S&P 500 in recent periods.  However, this performance comes with significant volatility as reflected by the large Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  While recent earnings have shown positive surprises, the recent price movement suggests some short-term bearish pressure.  The high profit margins and revenue growth are positive signs.  Long-term investment potential exists, but investors should be aware of the considerable risk involved due to the volatility and the substantial fluctuations seen. A thorough understanding of the company's business model and future prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence, including an assessment of the company's competitive landscape and regulatory environment, is highly recommended.
