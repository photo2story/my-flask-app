2025-04-25 - Analysis Report
## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

HOOD's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  While VOO shows a 14.85% return, HOOD boasts a 100.85% return. This substantial difference is further highlighted by the relative divergence, indicating HOOD's performance is at the 66.1st percentile of its historical range relative to VOO. However, this high relative divergence doesn't automatically mean future outperformance.  Significant volatility and potential for reversion to the mean need consideration.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and other metrics show significant volatility.  High MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values indicate substantial risk.  Alpha consistently close to zero suggests the stock's performance isn't significantly deviating from the market (Beta), but the significant change in CAGR over the periods presented warrants further investigation. Market capitalization has grown considerably over the analyzed period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 72.8% | -25.0% | 11.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0% | 74.3% | 126.0% | 33.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 144.0% | 74.3% | 129.0% | 42.6 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $48.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $43.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $41.30
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.43

The price shows a recent sharp increase (7.81% from previous close).  The price is above its 5-day, 20-day, and slightly below its 60-day moving average suggesting short-term upward momentum but potential for consolidation or correction.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 65.03 (Approaching overbought territory; potential for near-term correction)
* **PPO:** 2.08 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +12.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -15.6% (This suggests that HOOD is expected to underperform the S&P 500 by 15.6% over the long term; requires careful consideration).  The significant price increase ('change': 7.81%)  needs to be factored into this long-term prediction.  A sharp increase might lead to short-term overvaluation.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

HOOD has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters. This positive trend suggests improving financial performance. However, further analysis is needed to assess the sustainability of this trend and its impact on the long-term stock price.

|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.01B | 85.80%       |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

HOOD's recent performance has been exceptionally strong, significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance is accompanied by considerable volatility and a high relative divergence from the market benchmark. While earnings have been positive and exceeding expectations,  the long-term outlook based on provided data suggests underperformance against the S&P 500 (-15.6%).  The recent sharp price increase warrants caution, as it might be unsustainable.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the drivers of ROE fluctuations and an assessment of the company's long-term growth strategy, is essential before making any investment decisions.  The high MDD values highlight substantial risk.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high returns against the significant risk involved.
