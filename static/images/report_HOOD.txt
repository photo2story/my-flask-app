This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Robinhood Markets Inc. is a financial services company offering brokerage services and investment apps.

The cumulative return for HOOD is 270.58%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 36.61%.  The difference is 234.0 percentage points.  The relative divergence shows that this outperformance is at the 100th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range.  However, this high relative divergence should be interpreted cautiously given the short time frame considered in the data.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 14.1% | -0.0 | 11.3 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0% | 16.6% | 197.0% | -0.0 | 32.9 |
| 2023-2025  | 297.0% | 16.6% | 236.0% | -0.0 | 45.2 |

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of substantial growth, particularly between 2022-2025.  The Alpha indicates significant outperformance compared to the benchmark, and Beta exhibits high volatility.  Note that the data presented suggests unusual Alpha calculations; a 197% Alpha is impossible. This likely indicates a problem with how the alpha was calculated against the provided data.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $51.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $49.95
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $44.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $38.54

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an uptrend.  The recent increase of 3.54% shows a recent upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 76.76 (Overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.75 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-)  (Short-term downward trend in relative performance. Note: this needs clarification regarding the relative divergence - relative to what?)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -1.1% (This suggests underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, despite the recent strong performance). The price increase of 3.54% is a notable short term jump. This needs further investigation as it contradicts the projected long term negative return.

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and potentially due for a correction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17  | $0.18         |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21  | $0.15         |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18  | $0.06         |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.03  | $0.006        |
| 2023-11-07 | -$0.09 | -$0.1         |

Earnings have been positive in recent quarters, and exceeding expectations in several cases, specifically in Q2 and Q3 of 2024. This positive trend is a key driver of the stock price growth.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B    | 81.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68B    | 81.96%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.62B    | 81.23%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.47B    | 12.74%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.47B    | 75.80%        |

Revenue has been relatively stable, with a significant jump in Profit Margin in Q1, Q2 and Q3 of 2024. The significantly lower profit margin in Q4 2023 should be investigated.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.21     | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.12     | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88     | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.70     | 0.45    |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.57     | -1.29   |

Equity is growing steadily, and ROE has improved significantly in recent quarters, indicating better profitability.  Again, the negative ROE in Q4 2023 needs further examination.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD has shown impressive growth recently, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, several warning signs exist: the high RSI suggests the stock is overbought, and the projected long-term return is negative relative to the S&P 500.  The recent earnings show positive growth, but the financial information from Q4 2023 raises questions.  Thorough investigation into the reasons for the low profit margin and negative ROE in Q4 2023 is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Inconsistencies in the data provided (e.g., unrealistic alpha values) also need clarification.  A more in-depth fundamental analysis, including examination of the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects, is needed.  The short-term price surge requires further examination to determine whether it's sustainable.
