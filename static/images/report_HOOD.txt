**Analysis:**  The substantial volatility is evident in the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD).  While CAGR shows impressive growth in recent years (2022-2025),  the large swings and negative alpha in 2021-2023 indicate significant risk.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

HOOD exhibits a complex picture. While past performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, the high volatility, negative alpha periods, and overbought RSI suggest considerable risk.  While recent earnings have been strong, the projected negative return relative to the S&P 500 over the longer term raises concerns.  Investors should carefully consider the risk-reward profile before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence, including a deeper dive into the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape, is highly recommended.
