HOOD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return vastly exceeding that of the benchmark.

While the relative divergence indicates a strong outperformance compared to its historical performance against VOO, it's crucial to consider the inherent volatility indicated by the significant range of the divergence.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 72.8% | -23.0% | -0.0 | 11.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0% | 74.3% | 128.0% | 0.0 | 33.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 122.0% | 76.5% | 111.0% | 0.0 | 35.9 |

The significant volatility in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights the risk associated with HOOD. The near-zero beta suggests low correlation with the overall market, while the wildly fluctuating alpha indicates periods of both extreme underperformance and outperformance relative to the market.

* **Closing Price:** $40.51
* **Previous Close:** $42.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $37.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $41.54
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $47.27

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend. The recent price drop of $4.03 (almost 10%) signals a significant negative movement in the short term.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk) – Suggests moderate risk.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.96 – Below 50, indicating bearish momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.8% – Indicates a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return:** -20.4% –  A negative expected return, suggesting potential downside risk.  This likely reflects the current market sentiment and short-term price movement.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further analysis beyond this short-term prediction.

Equity is increasing, but ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, indicating variability in profitability.  The significant jump in ROE in Q4 2024 is notable and requires further investigation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

HOOD's performance shows high volatility and significant swings in both price and profitability.  While the company has demonstrated periods of substantial outperformance against the S&P 500, this comes with considerable risk.  The negative short-term expected return and bearish technical indicators suggest caution.  However, the recent revenue growth and generally high profit margins point to a potentially strong underlying business.  A long-term investment requires careful consideration of the company's ability to maintain its revenue growth and improve consistency in profitability.  Further due diligence is needed to assess the long-term potential, particularly to understand the drivers behind the significant volatility and to confirm the sustainability of the high profit margins.  The recent price drop should also be carefully considered, as it could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors, provided that the negative trends are reversed in the future.
