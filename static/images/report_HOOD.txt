## Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) based on the provided data.  Robinhood is a financial services company offering commission-free trading of stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Robinhood's cumulative return (195.68%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (37.68%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 158.0%, placing it at the 95.9th percentile of the historical range (max: 167.5%, min: -63.3%).  While the high relative percentile suggests strong outperformance, itâ€™s crucial to consider the volatility inherent in this significant divergence. The provided CAGR figures (3.0% and 251.0%) highlight substantial variability in year-over-year performance.  The high beta values (11.0 and 36.0) suggest high sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $40.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $38.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $37.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $29.96

The price is above all three moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend.  However, the relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day averages suggests recent price movement has not been overly dramatic.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (60.19):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in a neutral territory.
* **PPO (-0.95):**  Indicates a bearish signal, with the price momentum below the average price momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-4.1):** Shows a recent slight downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (21.3%):**  This suggests a significant potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming consistent performance at this level and consistent investment.  However, this is a projection and not a guaranteed outcome.  The high volatility indicated elsewhere in the report should be considered.

* **Profit Margin:**  High profit margins (80-81%) in recent quarters, except for Q4 2023 (12.74%). This suggests potential operational efficiency improvements.

**6. News and Recent Issues:** (Information not provided, cannot be analyzed)


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD exhibits strong short-term growth compared to the S&P 500 but shows high volatility and significant variations in year-over-year performance, as reflected in the CAGR and beta values. While recent earnings have been significantly positive, exceeding expectations in several instances, and showing improved profitability, caution is warranted given the historical volatility and the relatively high beta, suggesting potential for significant price swings. The high expected return warrants consideration, but the inherent risk must be carefully evaluated given the high beta and volatility. The technical indicators provide mixed signals, while the fundamental data demonstrates strong earnings growth and profit margins in recent quarters.  More information on recent news and market outlook is needed for a complete analysis.
