## Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) Investment Review

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) is a technology company that provides a brokerage platform for investing and trading stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other financial instruments.

The cumulative return of HOOD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period.  The difference is substantial:

* **HOOD Cumulative Return:** 190.39%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 28.86%
* **Difference:** 161.5%

The relative divergence of 92.7% indicates that HOOD's performance has been exceptionally higher than the S&P 500 throughout a substantial portion of the historical data considered.  However, it is crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha/beta data is highly volatile, demonstrating inconsistent performance. While periods show extremely high positive alpha, this is not sustainable and suggests significant risk. The high beta values across periods indicate HOOD's high sensitivity to market movements.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 14.1% | 5.0% | 11.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0% | 16.6% | 197.0% | 33.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 217.0% | 16.6% | 164.0% | 35.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $40.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $39.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $34.47

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, it is above both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.85 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.36 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.4 (Positive, indicating short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -1.7% (relative to S&P 500)

The current price of $40.08 doesn't necessarily suggest a dramatic price swing (either up or down) based on this limited data. The negative expected return suggests that, even with a long-term investment horizon, HOOD is not projected to outperform the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

HOOD has shown significant variability in EPS. While some quarters exceeded expectations considerably, others fell short.  The substantial increase in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024 is notable, but needs further analysis to determine sustainability.


| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17   | $0.18        |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21   | $0.15        |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18   | $0.06        |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.03   | $0.006       |
| 2023-11-07 | -$0.09  | -$0.1        |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable in recent quarters, however, profit margins show significant volatility.  The drastic drop in profit margin in Q4 2023 is concerning and requires further investigation.  ROE is low and shows improvement in recent quarters, but is still not particularly strong.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B    | 81.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68B    | 81.96%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.62B    | 81.23%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.47B    | 12.74%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.47B    | 75.80%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.21     | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.12     | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88     | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.70     | 0.45    |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.57     | -1.29   |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD has shown periods of exceptional performance significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, this volatility is a major concern.  The high beta suggests substantial risk.  While recent earnings show some improvement, the inconsistency and the significant drop in profit margin in Q4 2023 raise red flags.  The negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon suggests that despite the impressive past performance,  caution is warranted before investing.  Further investigation into the drivers of the significant profit margin fluctuations and the sustainability of recent earnings growth is crucial.  A thorough understanding of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is necessary before making an investment decision.
