## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Report

This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD), a commission-free stock trading platform, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Robinhood's cumulative return (236.17%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (33.09%) over the analyzed period. The difference is substantial (203.1%), placing it at the 100th percentile of the historical relative performance range.  However, this high relative performance needs to be viewed in context of the provided CAGR data (below) which displays significant volatility and possibly unsustainable growth.  The high relative performance is likely influenced by the short time period considered.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta data show high volatility and inconsistent performance. While 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 show exceptionally high CAGR, this is likely unsustainable and the MDD highlights substantial risk. The near-zero Alpha indicates performance largely tracking the market, while the high Beta (41.0) suggests significant sensitivity to market movements.  The Capitalization (Cap(B)) remains constant in this analysis but is crucial further context.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0%    | 50.0%   | -0.0  | 41.0  |       |
| 2022-2024  | 216.0%  | 36.8%   | -0.0  | 41.0  |       |
| 2023-2025  | 279.0%  | 32.2%   | -0.0  | 41.0  |       |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $46.40
* **Last Market Price:** $46.30
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $42.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $40.21
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $35.57

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. However, given the volatility shown in the CAGR data, caution is needed.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.22 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.93 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +6.4% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -1.3% (Negative expected return relative to the S&P 500)

The RSI is nearing overbought levels, suggesting potential for a near-term pullback.  The PPO shows positive momentum, and the high relative strength change aligns with recent price movements. The negative expected return against the S&P 500 highlights a significant risk consideration.  Since the Last Market price and closing price are nearly identical, there is no indication of recent dramatic price swings.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17    | $0.18         |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21    | $0.15         |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18    | $0.06         |

| 2023-11-07 | -$0.09   | -$0.1         |

Earnings have generally exceeded expectations recently, except for the most recent quarter.  The significant improvement from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024, then Q2 2024 is notable.  Continued positive surprises could drive further price appreciation; however, consistent earnings exceeding expectation is necessary for long-term growth.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD shows high volatility and inconsistent performance. While recent returns have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and earnings have been positive, the high Beta and negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggest significant risk.  Technical indicators show mixed signals with positive momentum but RSI nearing overbought levels.  The financial information displays a strong performance increase over the past year but further sustained growth and consistent earnings exceeding expectations are crucial to validate continued strong performance.  Further investigation into the reasons for the high Beta and significant volatility is recommended.  Before investing, consider a thorough due diligence process and carefully assess your risk tolerance.
