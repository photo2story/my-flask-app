**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

HOOD's cumulative return (278.91%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (37.30%).  The difference is 241.6%, placing it at the 97.4th percentile of the historical divergence range (max: 249.7, min: -63.3). This indicates HOOD's performance has been exceptionally strong relative to the broader market, at least during the period considered.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0%    | 14.1%   | 5.0%   | 0.0    | 11.5    |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0%  | 16.6%   | 197.0% | -0.0   | 33.7    |
| 2023-2025  | 305.0%  | 16.6%   | 244.0% | -0.0   | 48.1    |

The analysis reveals highly volatile performance with exceptionally high CAGR in recent periods (2022-2025), driven by seemingly high alpha.  However, the beta values indicate significant market sensitivity. Note that the alpha and beta figures seem inconsistent with each other and need further investigation for validation. The market cap has significantly increased in this period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $53.17
* **Last Market Price:** $54.45 (increase of $2.41)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $52.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $48.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $41.22

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The recent market price shows a sharp increase.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 69.57 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.07 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.6 (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return:** -1.1% (Long-term expected underperformance relative to S&P 500)

The RSI is near overbought levels, indicating potential short-term correction.  The positive PPO supports the upward trend. However, recent relative divergence suggests a possible downward correction. The significant recent price increase of 2.41 needs further investigation to understand the drivers. The negative expected return highlights the risk.

Equity is growing, but ROE is volatile, reflecting the company's fluctuating profitability.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

HOOD has demonstrated exceptionally strong performance relative to the S&P 500,  driven by strong earnings and revenue growth. However,  the high volatility, and near overbought RSI suggest caution. While recent earnings have been positive and exceeding expectations, the long-term expected return is negative compared to the S&P 500.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with HOOD's volatile nature before making any investment decisions. Further investigation into the drivers of recent price increase and the discrepancies in alpha and beta values is recommended.
