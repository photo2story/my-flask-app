## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**

Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) is a technology-driven financial services company offering commission-free trading and investing platforms.  This report analyzes HOOD's performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and examining key financial metrics.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

HOOD's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.

* **HOOD Cumulative Return:** 100.58%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 18.60%
* **Return Difference:** 81.98%
* **Relative Deviation:** 64.2% (This indicates HOOD's performance is in the 64.2nd percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on its historical maximum and minimum deviation.)

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 72.8% | -25.0% | -0.0 | 11.2 |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0% | 74.3% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 32.9 |
| 2023-2025  | 144.0% | 74.3% | 125.0% | -0.0 | 42.9 |

**Analysis:**  While recent years show exceptionally high CAGR, the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights significant risk. The negative Alpha in 2021-2023 suggests underperformance relative to the market, while positive Alphas in subsequent years indicate outperformance.  The near-zero Beta suggests limited correlation with the overall market.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $48.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $48.52
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $43.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.06

**Analysis:** The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish short-term trend. The recent price increase of 4.23% from the previous close signifies a rapid upward movement.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 61.65 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 1.68 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Deviation Change:** -4.0% (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years):** -16.2% (This suggests that even with the recent price gains, a long-term investment may underperform the S&P 500 by 16.2%.)

**Analysis:** While the RSI and PPO suggest positive momentum, the negative relative deviation change and the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 warrant caution.  The recent sharp price increase (4.23%) might be a temporary surge, potentially fueled by short-term market factors rather than sustainable fundamental growth.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-04-30 | $0.37   | $0.3253       |
| 2025-02-12 | $0.54   | $0.4184       |
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17   | $0.18         |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21   | $0.15         |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18   | $0.06         |

**Analysis:** HOOD consistently exceeded expected EPS in recent quarters, indicating positive earnings surprises.  This suggests that the company is performing better than analysts' predictions. However, it's crucial to analyze the reasons behind these positive surprises to assess their sustainability.

**5) Financial Information:**

| 2024-06-30 | $7.12B | 2.64%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88B | 2.28%  |

**Analysis:** Revenue shows growth, although it fluctuates.  Profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong profitability. ROE fluctuates but generally remains positive, though the recent decline in 2025 Q1 warrants observation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

HOOD demonstrates significant short-term outperformance against the S&P 500, driven by positive earnings surprises and strong profitability. However,  the high MDD, the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500, and the recent dip in ROE raise concerns about sustainability and risk.  The recent price surge might be a temporary phenomenon. Further investigation into the drivers of recent performance and the long-term growth prospects of the company is necessary before forming a conclusive investment opinion. A cautious approach is recommended, carefully considering the inherent volatility of the stock.
