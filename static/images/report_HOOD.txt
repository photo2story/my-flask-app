*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 20.65%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** 123.1
*   **Relative Divergence:** 82.2

**Analysis:** HOOD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period. The relative divergence of 82.2 indicates that HOOD's outperformance is positioned high within its historical range compared to VOO. This suggests strong recent performance relative to the market.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year        | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
| ----------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| 2021-2023   | -9.0%   | 72.8% | -23.0%  | 0.0  | 11.2   |
| 2022-2024   | 151.0%  | 74.3% | 128.0%  | 0.0  | 32.8   |
| 2023-2025   | 187.0%  | 74.3% | 166.0%  | 0.0  | 52.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows a significant increase in recent periods, especially from 2022-2024 and 2023-2025, reflecting strong growth.  However, the period from 2021-2023 shows negative growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial volatility and risk associated with HOOD.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is very high for the later periods, showing significant outperformance relative to the benchmark. However, 2021-2023 shows the opposite with a negative Alpha.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 0.0 across all periods suggests that HOOD's price movements are not correlated to the S&P 500 index (VOO). This is highly unusual and may suggest that the model used to calculate Beta has issues or HOOD's performance is driven by factors entirely unrelated to the broader market.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 58.93, 'previousClose': 61.39, 'change': -4.01}
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 55.04
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 48.23
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 45.53

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  However, the 'Last Market Data' shows a price drop (change: -4.01) compared to the previous close, indicating a recent pullback or negative market reaction. This could be a short-term correction within a larger uptrend.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -9.0

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates a low-risk environment.
*   The RSI is very high (above 70, typically considered overbought), suggesting the stock may be due for a correction.
*   The PPO is positive, confirming the upward trend, but the degree of divergence might also suggest overbought conditions.
*   The significant increase in relative divergence over the past 20 days points to a recent surge in outperformance.
*   The Expected Return of -9.0% indicates potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This contrasts with the recent high performance, suggesting a potential reversion to the mean or changing market conditions.
*   The negative change compared to the previous close should be considered with the high RSI.
