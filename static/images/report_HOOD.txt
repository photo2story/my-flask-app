| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | HOOD Cumulative Return | VOO Cumulative Return | Return Difference |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 14.1% | 5.0% | -0.0 | 11.0 |                        |                       |                    |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0%| 16.6% | 197.0%| -0.0 | 33.0 |                        |                       |                    |
| 2023-2025  | 229.0%| 16.6% | 175.0%| -0.0 | 37.0 | 202.56%                 | 29.41%                 | 173.15%            |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $41.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $40.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $39.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $34.93

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, this is short-term analysis and shouldn't be the sole basis for investment decisions.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.49 (Neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.31 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -0.8 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -1.4% (Expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term)

The conflicting signals from RSI and PPO, coupled with the negative expected return, highlight the uncertainty surrounding HOOD's future performance. The current price of $41.76 doesn't show signs of extreme price action (sudden surges or drops) based on the provided data, but the short-term trend appears bearish.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17   | $0.18        | -$0.01      |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21   | $0.15        | $0.06       |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18   | $0.06        | $0.12       |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.03   | $0.006       | $0.024      |
| 2023-11-07 | -$0.09  | -$0.1        | $0.01       |

Earnings have been volatile but generally exceeding expectations in recent quarters, except for the most recent quarter.  This suggests potential inconsistency in the company's performance.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64       | 81.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68       | 81.96%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.62       | 81.23%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.47       | 12.74%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.47       | 75.80%        |

Revenue has been relatively stable in the last four quarters, with significantly higher profit margins in 2024. The drop in profit margin in Q4 2023 is notable and needs further investigation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.21       | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.12       | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88       | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.70       | 0.45    |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.57       | -1.29   |

Equity has shown steady growth, and ROE has generally improved, although it remains relatively low.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD exhibits high volatility and has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  However, the current indicators (PPO, expected return) suggest a potential downside. While recent earnings have mostly beat expectations, the inconsistency and low ROE raise concerns.  The strong revenue and profit margin (except Q4 2023) are positive signs but need to be considered in the context of the overall market conditions and the company's long-term growth prospects.  Further research into the reasons for the Q4 2023 margin drop and the company's future growth strategy is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high historical volatility suggests a higher risk profile.
