## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Report

This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD), a commission-free stock trading platform offering a range of financial services.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

HOOD's cumulative return (72.37%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (10.86%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 61.5%, placing it in the 54.9th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -58.9% and a maximum of 160.4%).  This suggests HOOD's performance has been considerably stronger than the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 72.8% | -0.0  | 11.3  |       |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0%| 74.3% | 0.0   | 33.0  |       |
| 2023-2025  | 116.0%| 74.3% | -0.0  | 36.5  |       |

The high beta values (11.3 - 36.5) indicate HOOD's price is significantly more volatile than the market.  The fluctuating CAGR highlights the substantial risk involved in investing in HOOD.  Alpha values near zero suggest performance largely tracks the market, albeit with significantly higher volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $41.18
* **5-day moving average:** $42.75
* **20-day moving average:** $41.84
* **60-day moving average:** $46.83

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downward trend.  The recent price increase (+$1.28) shows a small upward bounce, but the sustained position below moving averages suggests further bearish pressure may exist.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.73 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.14 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -22.6% (relative to S&P 500)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO suggests bullish momentum, the negative relative divergence and the negative expected return signal caution.  The relatively low RSI and MRI further support the indication of a moderate to medium level of risk.  The recent price increase, while positive, is not significant enough to override the other bearish signals.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 2025-02-12 | $0.54   | $0.4184       | $0.1216     |
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17   | $0.18         | -$0.01      |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21   | $0.15         | $0.06       |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18   | $0.06         | $0.12       |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.03   | $0.0074       | $0.0226     |

Earnings have consistently exceeded expectations, except in one instance. This suggests positive growth potential. The significant increase in EPS in the last quarter (Feb 2025) is particularly noteworthy.

| 2023-12-31  | $0.47B      | 78.13%        |

Revenue shows a clear upward trend, and profit margins remain consistently high, indicating strong financial health.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $7.97B      | 11.49%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $7.21B      | 2.08%         |
| 2024-06-30  | $7.12B      | 2.64%         |
| 2024-03-31  | $6.88B      | 2.28%         |
| 2023-12-31  | $6.70B      | 0.45%         |

Equity is growing steadily, but ROE fluctuates, suggesting potential challenges in consistent profitability.  The high ROE in the last quarter indicates potential improvement in profitability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD's performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500, demonstrating strong growth potential.  However, the high beta indicates substantial risk.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend, despite a recent slight upward bounce.  While earnings have been exceeding expectations and revenue is growing strongly, the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative.  Investors should carefully consider the high volatility and risk before investing in HOOD.  The positive earnings and revenue growth trends suggest potential for future growth, but the considerable price volatility necessitates caution.  Further research into the underlying drivers of recent earnings growth and the reasons for fluctuations in ROE is recommended.
