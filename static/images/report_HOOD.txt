This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc, a commission-free stock trading platform, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

HOOD's cumulative return (106.24%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (15.67%).  The difference is 90.6%, placing it at the 68.2nd percentile of its historical range (max: 160.4%, min: -58.9%).  This indicates HOOD's strong performance relative to the market, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance. While 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods show extremely high CAGR and positive Alpha,  2021-2023 shows a significant negative CAGR and negative Alpha. The Beta fluctuates, suggesting high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization increased significantly over the period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 72.8% | -25.0% | -0.0 | 11.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0% | 74.3% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 32.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 149.0% | 74.3% | 134.0% | -0.0 | 42.6 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $49.45
* **Daily Change:** +$2.70 (5.6%) - Significant positive daily movement.
* **5-day MA:** $44.84
* **20-day MA:** $41.57
* **60-day MA:** $46.41

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The significant daily increase warrants further investigation for potential news or events driving this movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 74.54 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +13.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -14.6% (Negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term).


The 2.7% daily increase indicates a potential short-term price surge, which contradicts the -14.6% long-term expected return.  This discrepancy needs further investigation into underlying factors.

HOOD has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  This positive trend suggests improving profitability and positive growth.

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.01B   | 85.80%       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD shows strong recent performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Earnings have been consistently better than expected, and revenue is growing with high profit margins. However, the high RSI suggests potential short-term overvaluation, and the volatile ROE and inconsistent Alpha/Beta across different periods warrant caution.  The large daily price increase requires further investigation to determine the cause. The long-term expected return is negative compared to the S&P 500, despite the strong recent performance.  Further research is needed to reconcile these conflicting signals and to assess the sustainability of HOOD's recent growth.  Investors should consider the significant volatility before making any investment decisions.
