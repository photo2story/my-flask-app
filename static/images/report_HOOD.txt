**6) Overall Analysis:**

HOOD exhibits high growth potential but considerable volatility.  The stock significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, primarily driven by strong earnings beats and revenue growth, despite recent price declines.  However,  the high relative divergence and considerable MDD highlight inherent risk.  The provided -3.1% expected return is contradictory to the long term CAGR figures and needs further context or clarification.  A thorough assessment of the company's long-term growth strategy, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The recent earnings are positive, but the slowing QoQ revenue growth is a concern that needs to be monitored.  The high profit margins are a strength.  The highly volatile ROE also requires further investigation into the underlying factors driving these fluctuations.
