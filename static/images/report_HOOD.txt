## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Investment Report

**1. Performance Overview & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) is a financial services company offering commission-free stock and cryptocurrency trading.

The cumulative return for HOOD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns, as of the last data point, is 225.4 percentage points.  While the provided relative divergence metric of 100% shows HOOD's performance at the highest point in the historical range compared to VOO, itâ€™s crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.


The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows highly variable performance across different periods.  This volatility is further reflected in the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values.  The alpha consistently shows a negative value (-0.0) and the Beta of 45.0 indicates extremely high sensitivity to market movements.  This suggests that HOOD's performance is largely driven by market trends and doesn't demonstrate consistent outperformance.  High Beta and high MDD signify significant risk.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD (%) | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0%     | 50.0%   | -0.0  | 45.0  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 216.0%   | 36.8%   | -0.0  | 45.0  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 308.0%   | 32.2%   | -0.0  | 45.0  |        |

* **5-day Moving Average:** $48.95
* **20-day Moving Average:** $42.43
* **60-day Moving Average:** $37.07

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day MA might indicate near-term consolidation.

The price increase of $0.20 from the previous close indicates a slight upward movement.  However, given the high RSI and negative expected return, caution is warranted.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis**

HOOD has shown significant positive surprises in recent earnings, exceeding expectations in multiple quarters.  This is a positive sign.  However, it's important to assess the sustainability of this trend.

**7. Overall Analysis**

HOOD shows high growth potential but with significant risk.  The substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is noteworthy but unsustainable based on its high Beta and volatile performance history. Recent earnings have been positive, but profit margins are inconsistent. The high RSI suggests a potential near-term correction.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  Further investigation into the drivers of the fluctuating profit margins and the sustainability of recent earnings beats is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Given the high risk, a long-term investment strategy with a significant risk tolerance is necessary.  Conservative investors should proceed with caution.
