**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD's performance has vastly outpaced the S&P 500 in the past, but recent data reveals a mixed picture.

The projected long-term return is negative relative to the S&P 500.  Further analysis is required to assess future performance, especially concerning any recent news or market outlook impacting HOOD. The volatility in EPS and profit margin should be a significant concern for investors.
