## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD), a commission-free stock trading platform.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

HOOD's cumulative return (354.65%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 38.50%.  The difference is 316.1%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical range against VOO (based on provided relative divergence).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows wildly varying performance across short periods:


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                     |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 14.1% | 5.0% | 0.0 | 11.3 | Extremely poor performance.                 |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0% | 16.6% | 197.0% | -0.0 | 32.9 |  Significant positive Alpha, high volatility.|
| 2023-2025  | 381.0% | 16.6% | 318.0% | -0.0 | 56.4 | Extremely strong performance, high volatility.|


The high volatility and inconsistent performance highlight significant risk.  The Alpha values are unusually high and likely reflect short-term market fluctuations rather than consistent outperformance driven by inherent company strength.  Further investigation into drivers of these large swings is needed.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $63.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $57.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $52.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $43.30

The stock price shows a recent significant jump (14.11% increase from the previous close), exceeding its short-term moving averages considerably.  This indicates a rapid price surge which warrants further analysis to determine sustainability.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.45 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.69 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -0.9% (Negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years))

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction. The positive PPO supports the recent upward trend, but the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 indicates that long-term, consistent outperformance is not expected. The recent significant price change (14.11%) indicates a possible rapid price surge, which is a significant event that should be carefully considered.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-12 | 1.01    | 0.4184       | Significant Beat |
| 2024-10-30 | 0.17    | 0.18         | Slight Miss  |
| 2024-08-07 | 0.21    | 0.15         | Significant Beat |
| 2024-05-08 | 0.18    | 0.06         | Significant Beat |
| 2024-02-13 | 0.03    | 0.006        | Significant Beat |

Recent earnings have generally exceeded expectations, indicating positive operational performance in recent quarters, which could explain the recent price surge. However, the extreme variance between the Feb 2025 EPS and earlier figures demands further investigation into the underlying factors causing this.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Notes                                         |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B     | 81.00%        | High profit margin                              |

| 2023-09-30 | $0.47B     | 75.80%        | High profit margin                              |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.21     | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.12     | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88     | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.70     | 0.45    |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.57     | -1.29   |


Profit margins are generally high, except for a significant dip in Q4 2023.  ROE is consistently positive but relatively low.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

HOOD has shown exceptionally high returns relative to the S&P 500 over the last few years, however this performance is highly erratic and likely unsustainable. Recent earnings beats are positive, but the extremely high profit margins compared to Q4 2023 are a significant outlier demanding further analysis.  The recent price surge, while impressive, necessitates caution due to the high RSI and the overall volatility of the stock.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests that despite recent gains, long-term investors should proceed with caution. Further investigation is required to understand the drivers of the extreme volatility and the significant jump in EPS in the most recent quarter to assess the long-term viability and risk profile of the company.  A thorough fundamental analysis considering macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.
