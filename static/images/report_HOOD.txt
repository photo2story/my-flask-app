## Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) Analysis

**Company Overview:** Robinhood Markets Inc. is a financial services company offering a platform for commission-free trading and investing.

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **HOOD Cumulative Return:** 241.54%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 34.98%
*   **Spread:**
    *   **Current:** 208.2
    *   **Max:** 236.3
    *   **Min:** -59.9
    *   **Relative Spread:** 90.5

**Analysis:**  HOOD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the tracked period. The "Relative Spread" of 90.5 indicates that HOOD's outperformance is near the higher end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This substantial outperformance, however, should be viewed in context (see overall analysis).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap (B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0%   | 72.8%   | -12.0%  | -0.1   | 11.2    |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0%  | 74.3%   | 126.0%  | -0.0   | 32.9    |
| 2023-2025  | 285.0%  | 74.3%   | 234.0%  | -0.0   | 90.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows highly variable performance across different periods.  Notably, the 2023-2025 period boasts a very high CAGR of 285.0%, reflecting significant growth.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is consistently high (around 73-74%), indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Positive alpha values (especially in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025) suggest HOOD has outperformed its expected return based on market risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are very close to zero, which is unexpected for a stock. A beta near zero implies that HOOD's price movements are largely uncorrelated with the overall market. This could indicate a unique driver for HOOD's performance or potential issues with the data.
*   **Cap:** Market capitalization has increased from 11.2B to 90.0B

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 101.93
*   **Previous Close:** 102.08
*   **Change:** -0.15
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 103.988
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 97.3484
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 75.9738

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, but the fact that the price is below the 5-day MA may indicate a short-term pullback. The significant difference between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages further highlights recent rapid price appreciation.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **MRI:** 0.3274 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 61.98
*   **PPO:** -1.0153
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_70%_Sell 70.0% of holdings (1177 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 70% on 2025-07-22)
*   **Delta Previous Relative Divergence (20-day):** -9.3 (Negative - indicating short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** -2.1% (Over 2 years relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates a low-risk environment, which seems contradictory given the high volatility suggested by the MDD in the alpha/beta analysis.
*   The RSI of 61.98 is nearing overbought territory (typically above 70), suggesting the stock *may* be due for a correction. However, it's not definitively overbought.
*   The negative PPO suggests that the stock is oversold (Potential Buy signal).
*   Hybrid Signal suggests to sell 70% of Holdings, so caution.
*   The negative change in relative divergence suggests a recent short-term downward trend.
*   The negative expected return suggests that, based on current conditions, the model predicts HOOD will underperform the S&P 500 over the next two years if bought and held.
*   The minor price change from the previous close suggests no immediate significant volatility event, but this should be watched closely.

### 7. Overall Summary

Robinhood (HOOD) has shown strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with high volatility. Recent earnings have generally beaten expectations, and revenue and profit margins are strong. However, the stock's beta near zero is unusual, and the negative expected return suggests potential underperformance in the near future relative to the S&P 500. Recent news indicates potential volatility. The Hybrid Signal recommends caution and reducing holdings.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Volatility:** The high MDD and recent news events highlight the stock's volatile nature.
*   **Outperformance Sustainability:**  It's important to assess whether the historical outperformance is sustainable, given the changing market conditions and the company's specific challenges and opportunities.
*   **Beta Anomaly:** Investigate the reason for the near-zero beta. This is atypical and raises questions about the relationship between HOOD and the broader market.
*   **Hybrid Signal and MRI discrepancy:** Discrepancy between MRI and hybrid signal's holding signal need more investigation.
*   **Relative Spread:** High relative spread may mean the stock is overvalued.
*   **Profit Margin:** High profit margin may be unsustainable.
*   **Capital:** Market capitalization has increased a lot, which may mean it's overvalued.
*   **Short-term Pullback:** 5-day moving average is decreasing may mean that it's a short-term pullback.
*   **ROE Decline:** The recent decrease in ROE may be concerning and needs more investigation.

**In conclusion, while Robinhood has demonstrated impressive growth and profitability, the high volatility, mixed signals from indicators, and recent news warrant caution. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, monitor news closely, and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in HOOD.**
