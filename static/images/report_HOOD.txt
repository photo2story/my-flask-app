## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD), a commission-free online brokerage platform, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return for HOOD is 217.74%, while VOO's is 38.54%. This represents a substantial divergence of 179.2 percentage points.  The provided relative divergence of 100% indicates that this outperformance is at the extreme upper end of the historical range observed.  However, note that the provided Alpha and Beta values show considerable variability between the given time periods (2021-2023 vs 2022-2024).  This suggests the performance might be quite volatile and not consistently outperform the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $43.20
* **5-day Moving Average:** $39.59
* **20-day Moving Average:** $38.09
* **60-day Moving Average:** $30.30

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 63.93.  This indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting further upward movement is possible.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.41.  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.  This contrasts with the positive price movement shown by moving averages, hinting at potential short-term price correction.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +6.3 (Positive short-term upward trend).

* **Expected Return:** 20.8%.  This suggests a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  The closing price of $43.20, being above moving averages, doesn't represent a drastic jump or fall; it aligns with the positive short-term trend indicated by the relative divergence.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows significant variability and some inconsistencies. While there were significant EPS beats in several quarters (especially Q2 2024), there are also instances of considerable misses (like Q1 2024 and Q4 2023).  The trend isn't consistently positive, indicating unpredictable earnings growth.  While Q2 2024 showed impressive results, this performance needs to be observed for consistency.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally maintains a relatively stable level in recent quarters.  Profit margins were exceptionally high in Q1-Q3 2024, but significantly dropped in Q4 2023. This extreme volatility warrants further investigation.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily growing. ROE shows improvements after a negative value in Q3 2023.  Again, the substantial changes in ROE raise concerns about consistency.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:** Information on earnings news from the last two days is missing.  This section requires additional data.
* **Recent Market Outlook:**  Missing.
* **Analyst Opinions:** Missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD shows substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this is accompanied by volatile performance in various metrics (Alpha/Beta, EPS, Profit Margins, ROE).  The recent positive price movement is supported by the moving averages and a positive relative divergence but countered by a negative PPO.  The very high profit margins in recent quarters are inconsistent with previous quarters and need further analysis.  Missing information on recent news, market outlook and analyst opinions hinders a complete assessment.  While the expected return is promising, the high volatility suggests a higher risk profile.  Further investigation is needed to determine the sustainability of HOODâ€™s current performance.
