**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD has shown exceptionally high cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500, however, this has been characterized by high volatility and significant changes in Beta.  While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, the relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest caution.  The stock price is currently below several moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The provided data suggests a strong revenue and profitability profile but lacks sufficient information for definitively assessing long-term S&P 500 outperformance.  Further analysis, including consideration of macroeconomic factors and industry trends, is necessary for a complete investment decision.  The high volatility and seemingly inconsistent Alpha and Beta suggest a higher risk investment.
