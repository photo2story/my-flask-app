## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Preliminary Analysis:**

HOOD's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the exact timeframe isn't specified, the substantial difference warrants further investigation into the drivers of this outperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) is a technology company offering commission-free trading and financial services.

* **Cumulative Return Comparison:** HOOD shows a cumulative return of 104.8%, while VOO shows 16.5%.  The difference is 88.3%, placing it in the 67.1st percentile of historical relative performance compared to VOO (based on a range of -58.9% to +160.4%). This indicates HOOD's performance is significantly higher than VOO's.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided Alpha/Beta data shows inconsistent performance.  While 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 show extremely high CAGR (151% and 148% respectively), and positive alpha values, the  2021-2023 period shows negative CAGR and a nearly zero alpha.  The high beta (11.2 to 32.9) signifies high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The significant changes in market capitalization (Cap(B)) also suggests considerable growth and fluctuation in market value.


| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0%  | 72.8%  | -0.0   | 11.2  |       |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0% | 74.3%  | 0.0    | 32.9  |       |
| 2023-2025  | 148.0% | 74.3%  | -0.0   | 43.3  |       |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $49.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $49.00
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $42.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.25

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting recent minor downward pressure.  However, it sits above both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend.  The recent price decrease of $0.53 (-1.07%) from the previous close isn't significant enough to label as a sharp drop.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37, suggesting a low to medium risk level.
* **RSI:** 66.06, indicating the stock is in slightly overbought territory.
* **PPO:** 2.53, a positive value suggesting bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +6.5, suggesting a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -14.9%, this signifies potential for below-average returns. However, considering this is a short term expected return, it needs to be considered in context with the longer-term forecasts provided earlier that suggests significant outperformance of the S&P 500 with long term investment.

HOOD has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters. This positive trend suggests strong earnings growth.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD exhibits strong revenue growth and high profit margins.  Earnings consistently beat expectations. However, the stock's performance is highly volatile (high beta), and the short term expected return is negative.  The significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in certain periods and high CAGR in some periods makes a long term investment potentially attractive, but  the inconsistencies in profitability, and high volatility should be carefully considered.  Further investigation into the specific drivers of its high returns (compared to VOO) and the reasons for the fluctuating ROE is crucial before forming a conclusive opinion.  The high beta indicates a higher risk tolerance is required.
