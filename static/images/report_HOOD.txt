| 날짜       | EPS     | 예상 EPS | EPS Beat |
|------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 2025-04-30 | 0.37    | 0.3253    | 0.0447    |

**5. Financial Information:**

No Total Revenue or Gross Profit data is available, preventing a complete financial health assessment.  This lack of crucial information severely limits the ability to analyze profitability and sustainability.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

HOOD has shown periods of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025.  However, the absence of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) and inconsistent performance over time make a robust assessment difficult.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern.  While recent earnings show positive surprises, without comprehensive financial data, it's impossible to determine the long-term viability and value of HOOD.  Further investigation into the company's financial statements and future projections is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility and market sensitivity (high beta) also introduce substantial risk.
