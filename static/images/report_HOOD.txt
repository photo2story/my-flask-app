**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year        | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023   | -6.0%   | 82.5%   | 0.0%    | -0.1  | 11.5   |
| 2022-2024   | 183.0%  | 82.5%   | 162.0%  | 0.1   | 33.5   |
| 2023-2025   | 309.0%  | 79.1%   | 246.0%  | 0.1   | 105.3  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR has shown significant improvement. The negative CAGR from 2021-2023 shifted dramatically positive in subsequent periods, indicating strong growth in recent years.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD remains high, indicating significant risk and volatility. While decreasing slightly, the drawdowns are substantial, showing the potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** The high alpha values in the recent periods (162.0% and 246.0%) suggest that HOOD has significantly outperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) after accounting for risk, demonstrating strong value addition.
*   **Beta:** The low Beta values (close to 0.1) suggest that HOOD's price is not closely correlated with the overall market. This could indicate that HOOD's performance is driven more by company-specific factors rather than broad market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has grown significantly over the periods, reflecting the company's growth and investor confidence.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 117.16
*   **Previous Close:** 115.8
*   **Change:** 1.17
*   **5-day SMA:** 117.424
*   **20-day SMA:** 123.718
*   **60-day SMA:** 131.6452

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price has increased slightly in the last trading session.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a downtrend in the short to medium term, though the very recent price increase is a slight positive.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 36.85
*   **PPO:** -0.98
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** -11.1 (Short-term Decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 20.5%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI of 36.85 indicates that the stock is nearing an oversold condition, which could signal a potential buying opportunity.
*   The negative PPO (-0.98) suggests a downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying 100% of cash, indicating a favorable outlook despite short-term declines. The signal identifies it as "Very Safe," although this seems counterintuitive considering the high MDD values reported earlier. The MRI used by the Hybrid signal is high (0.90), suggesting the signal finds HOOD attractive.
*   The recent decrease in relative divergence (-11.1) confirms the short-term downtrend.
*   The expected return of 20.5% suggests a positive long-term outlook, exceeding the S&P 500.

    *   Analyst targets and prediction market growth.

**Analysis:** The news headlines indicate a mix of opinions and factors affecting the stock. The renewed interest in "Mag 7" stocks and positive analyst targets are bullish signals. The articles explaining stock price fluctuations suggest the stock is subject to volatility and market speculation.

    *   Subject to market speculation and volatility (as evidenced by the news headlines).
*   **Neutral Aspects:**
    *   Low Beta suggests its performance is more influenced by internal factors than the overall market.
    *   MRI suggesting Medium Risk.

**Conclusion:**

Robinhood appears to be a high-growth, high-risk investment. The company has demonstrated significant outperformance, but also exhibits substantial volatility and potential for large drawdowns. The analyst consensus and target price suggest potential upside, but the recent downtrend and market speculation should be carefully considered. The "Hybrid Signal" recommending "Buy" based on its MRI may be overly optimistic considering the reported drawdowns and volatility. Investors should carefully weigh their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in HOOD.
