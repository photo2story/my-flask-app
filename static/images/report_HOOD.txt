| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 7.0% | 78.6% | 3.0% | -0.0 | 11.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 170.0% | 83.7% | 154.0% | 0.1 | 33.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 101.0% | 83.7% | 98.0% | 0.1 | 30.6 |

**Analysis:** The CAGR shows significant growth, particularly between 2022-2024.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights considerable risk.  Alpha values suggest periods of significant outperformance against the market benchmark.  Beta values are low, indicating limited correlation with the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $34.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $39.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $41.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $47.44

The price is significantly below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The large negative change from the previous close (-9.8%) indicates a sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.6331 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.64 (Suggests the stock is potentially oversold, but not a definitive buy signal)
* **PPO:** -1.1887 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -9.0% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -1.3% (This represents the short-term expectation but contradicts the potentially long-term growth implied by prior analysis.)


The substantial negative price change (-9.8%) reflects a significant market event.  A -1.3% expected return in the short term is consistent with the recent price drop. The long-term (2+ years) expected return against the S&P 500, while not explicitly provided, needs further clarification in relation to the high risk indicated by the MRI.  Further investigation is required to understand the source of the negative short-term expected return in light of the long-term outperformance.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

HOOD's performance has been exceptional compared to the S&P 500, especially during the period analyzed. However, the stock is currently experiencing a significant downturn, reflected in its price being well below its moving averages and negative short-term expected return. The high Market Risk Indicator and high maximum drawdown highlight substantial volatility and risk. While the company shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, and earnings have generally exceeded expectations, the recent price drop and negative short-term outlook warrant caution.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent price drop and the surprisingly high Q4 2024 numbers are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The long-term prospects remain potentially positive given historical outperformance, but the risk is considerable. A thorough understanding of the factors driving recent volatility is essential before investing.
