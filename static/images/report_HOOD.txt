## Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), a commission-free online brokerage offering investment and financial services.  We will assess its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) using provided data, examining key metrics to determine its investment potential.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500:**

* **Cumulative Returns:** HOOD: 70.44%; VOO: 10.79%.  HOOD significantly outperformed VOO, with a difference of 59.6%.  The relative divergence, considering historical fluctuations (min -58.9%, max 160.4%), places the current outperformance at the 54th percentile. This suggests HOOD's current outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical volatility.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 72.8% | -25.0% | -0.0 | 11.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 151.0% | 74.3% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 33.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 114.0% | 74.3% | 103.0% | -0.0 | 36.0 |

The analysis shows high volatility in HOOD's performance. While exhibiting periods of extremely high CAGR (151% and 114%), it also experienced significant negative alpha (-25%) and high maximum drawdown (MDD) in 2021-2023, indicating substantial risk.  The beta values are near zero, suggesting limited correlation with the overall market.  The capital figures reflect company growth.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $40.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $42.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $41.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.98

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The recent price drop (-7.76) is significant.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.56 (slightly below neutral; leans bearish)
* **PPO:** 1.33 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum, although RSI contradicts this slightly)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.7% (short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return:** -23.4% (This negative expected return needs further clarification: is this the expected return from the current price, or a long-term forecast considering the large historical volatility?  A clarification is needed.)

The price drop of -7.76 suggests a significant negative market event influencing the stock.  The conflicting signals from the technical indicators warrant further investigation.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-12 | $0.54   | $0.4184      | $0.1216     |
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17   | $0.18        | -$0.01      |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21   | $0.15        | $0.06       |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18   | $0.06        | $0.12       |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.03   | $0.0074      | $0.0226     |

EPS has been consistently beating expectations, except for one quarter. This is a positive sign. However, this needs to be viewed within the context of the overall market performance and the company's financial health.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

**Capital and Profitability:**

Equity is growing, but ROE fluctuates, indicating potential volatility in profitability.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

HOOD's performance has been exceptionally volatile, exhibiting periods of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 and periods of substantial underperformance. While the recent earnings have been positive, and revenue and profit margins are impressive, the high volatility and negative expected return (-23.4%, needing clarification) pose substantial risk.  The contradictory signals from the technical indicators and the significant price drop warrant caution.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the reasons for the price drop, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high potential return needs to be carefully weighed against the extremely high risk.  Long-term investment may be considered only after a thorough risk assessment.
