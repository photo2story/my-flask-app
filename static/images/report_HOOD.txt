## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD) is a financial technology company offering commission-free trading and investment services.  This report analyzes HOOD's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), examining its cumulative return, price movements, technical indicators, earnings, and financial statements.  Significant divergence from the S&P 500 is observed, largely driven by substantial volatility and periods of strong outperformance.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **HOOD Cumulative Return:** 276.37%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 36.57%
* **Return Difference:** 239.8% (Relative Divergence: 97.9%)

HOOD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While the relative divergence suggests this outperformance is near the high end of historical observations, it's crucial to remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable alpha and beta across different timeframes, reflecting HOOD's volatility.  The high beta values (particularly in 2022-2025) indicate a higher sensitivity to market movements compared to the S&P 500. The inconsistent alpha suggests periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market, depending on the market's trend.  Further analysis of the underlying factors driving these fluctuations would be beneficial.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 14.1% | 5.0% | 0.0 | 11.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0% | 16.6% | 197.0% | -0.0 | 32.9 |
| 2023-2025  | 303.0% | 16.6% | 242.0% | -0.0 | 45.9 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $51.95
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $50.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $46.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $39.50

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential uptrend. However, the recent price drop of -$1.98 compared to the previous close indicates short-term weakness.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 77.34 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.64 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.1% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -1.1% (This suggests that long-term investment may not substantially outperform the S&P 500, relative to its current risk, despite periods of significant over-performance in the past.)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, increasing the risk of a price pullback. However, the positive PPO shows momentum. The combination of these indicators suggests caution. The -1.1% expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests that this superior past performance may not hold in the long run.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|-------------|------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17  | $0.18       | -$0.01      |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21  | $0.15       | $0.06       |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18  | $0.06       | $0.12       |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.03  | $0.006      | $0.024      |
| 2023-11-07 | -$0.09 | -$0.1       | $0.01       |

Earnings have been consistently better than expected in recent quarters, except for the most recent report.  This positive trend (until recently) is a positive sign.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B    | 81.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68B    | 81.96%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.62B    | 81.23%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.47B    | 12.74%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.47B    | 75.80%        |

Revenue has been relatively stable and strong, however, the profit margin experienced a significant dip in Q4 2023 before rebounding sharply. This warrants investigation into the underlying causes.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.21     | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.12     | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88     | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.70     | 0.45    |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.57     | -1.29   |

Equity has been steadily increasing, but ROE shows significant volatility, reflecting the overall variability of the company's performance.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

HOOD has shown periods of substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by strong earnings and growth in some quarters.  However, high volatility, and relatively recent underperformance compared to expectations, along with overbought conditions (as suggested by the RSI), warrants caution.  While long-term growth potential exists, the relatively low expected return compared to the S&P 500 and the significant price fluctuations indicate that HOOD carries considerable risk.  Further investigation into the factors driving the fluctuations in profitability and the recent drop in the profit margin is crucial for a more informed investment decision.  A thorough examination of competitive landscape, regulatory risks, and the company's long-term strategic plan is also necessary before making any investment decision.
