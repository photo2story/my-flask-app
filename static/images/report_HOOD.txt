## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Analysis

This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD), a commission-free online brokerage providing investing and financial services.

**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

HOOD's cumulative return of 280.12% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 36.91%. The divergence is substantial, with a current difference of 243.2%, representing the 93.6th percentile of the historical divergence range (max: 264.3%, min: -63.3%).  This suggests HOOD has historically outperformed the market significantly, but this should be viewed with caution.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 14.1% | 5.0% | 0.0 | 11.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0% | 16.6% | 197.0% | -0.0 | 32.9 |
| 2023-2025  | 306.0% | 16.6% | 245.0% | -0.0 | 47.1 |

**Analysis:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows extremely high growth from 2022-2025, significantly exceeding the market. However, the high alpha values (representing outperformance relative to a benchmark, which is likely the S&P 500 here) in the latter years are striking and warrant further investigation to determine if this is sustainable.  The relatively low Beta values suggest that HOOD's returns are not heavily correlated to the overall market. However, the 2021-2023 data shows a remarkably low CAGR of 3%, indicating a period of poor performance. This variability underscores the high risk associated with this stock.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $53.34
* **Previous Close:** $56.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $54.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $50.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $42.38

The price is currently below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend (though the recent drop is significant).  The price has fallen significantly from the previous close, indicating a recent price drop.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.93 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.16 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.1% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -1.1% (Expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term based on this single data point)

The price drop from the previous close (-5.21%) is significant and should be considered.  The combination of negative PPO and negative relative divergence reinforces the short-term bearish trend. Long-term expected return is negative against the S&P 500.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17   | $0.18        | -$0.01     |
| 2024-08-07 | $0.21   | $0.15        | $0.06      |
| 2024-05-08 | $0.18   | $0.06        | $0.12      |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.03   | $0.006       | $0.024     |
| 2023-11-07 | -$0.09  | -$0.1        | $0.01      |

**Analysis:** Earnings have been positive recently, consistently exceeding expectations in several quarters. This positive surprise could help explain the high returns.  However, the most recent quarter showed a slight miss of expectations.  This volatility requires further observation.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B    | 81.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68B    | 81.96%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.62B    | 81.23%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.47B    | 12.74%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.47B    | 75.80%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.21     | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.12     | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88     | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.70     | 0.45    |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.57     | -1.29   |


**Analysis:** Revenue has remained relatively stable over recent quarters.  Profit margins were exceptionally high in Q1 2024-Q3 2024, significantly dropping in Q4 2023.  ROE has also improved in recent quarters but remains modest. This needs more investigation, but the drop in profit margins and the very high profit margins in more recent quarters, should raise serious concerns.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

HOOD has shown periods of extremely high growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this performance has been highly volatile, with a period of significant underperformance (2021-2023). Recent financial data indicates high profit margins, but recent price action and technical indicators point towards a short-term bearish trend. While earnings have generally exceeded expectations, the sustainability of such high growth and profit margins is questionable.  The exceptionally high alpha and the long-term negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 are major inconsistencies requiring further research and caution.  Significant risk is associated with HOOD, and potential investors should carefully consider these factors before investing.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the recent high growth is sustainable and if the risks are justified by the potential reward.
