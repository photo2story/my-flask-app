## Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), a commission-free stock trading platform, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Robinhood's cumulative return (248.85%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (35.04%).  The difference is 213.8 percentage points.  The provided relative divergence metric of 100% indicates that this outperformance is at the extreme high end of the historical range observed in the data.  However, this high divergence should be interpreted cautiously, considering the short timeframe and potential for significant volatility.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show wildly fluctuating performance across different periods, emphasizing the inherent risk in HOOD.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $48.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $44.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $40.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $35.92

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend in the short to medium term.  The relatively large gap between the closing price and the moving averages indicates a recent rapid price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 68.72 – Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.39 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.3 – This confirms short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -1.3% – This suggests that, over the long term (2+ years), the stock is expected to underperform the S&P 500.  This is a counterpoint to the high short-term returns.  The high current price ($48.15) suggests the recent price increase may be unsustainable.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |

| 2024-08-07 | $0.21    | $0.15         | $0.06       |

| 2023-11-07 | -$0.09   | -$0.1         | $0.01       |


Earnings have shown significant volatility and a recent upward trend exceeding expectations, except for the most recent quarter. This volatility underscores the risk associated with HOOD.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B   | 81.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68B   | 81.96%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.62B   | 81.23%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.47B   | 12.74%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.47B   | 75.80%        |

Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins show significant fluctuation.  The dramatic drop in profit margin in Q4 2023 is a significant concern.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.21     | 2.08    |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.12     | 2.64    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.88     | 2.28    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.70     | 0.45    |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.57     | -1.29   |

Equity is steadily increasing, but ROE (Return on Equity) is volatile, mirroring the profit margin fluctuations.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD exhibits extremely high short-term returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this is accompanied by high volatility and considerable risk.  The recent price surge is reflected in the overbought RSI and the large gap between the price and its moving averages, suggesting a potential correction.  While recent earnings have been generally positive, the significant swings in profit margins and ROE highlight considerable financial uncertainty. The long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500.  Investors should proceed with caution, given the high risk profile and potential for significant price fluctuations.  Further research into the company's fundamentals and future growth prospects is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.
