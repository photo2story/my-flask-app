## Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

HOOD's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  Recent price action shows a slight downward trend, while technical indicators suggest overbought conditions. Earnings have shown strong growth, though profitability metrics exhibit some volatility.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) is a commission-free brokerage firm offering investment and financial services.

* **Cumulative Return:** HOOD: 276.37%, VOO: 36.57%
* **Return Difference:** HOOD significantly outperforms VOO by 239.8 percentage points.  This represents the 97.9th percentile of the historical difference between the two assets' performance.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent results across different periods.  While 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 show exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significant alpha, the 2021-2023 period reflects much lower growth and near-zero alpha. This suggests high volatility and inconsistency in performance.  The Beta values indicate increasing market sensitivity over time.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 14.1% | 5.0% | 0.0 | 11.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 230.0% | 16.6% | 197.0% | -0.0 | 32.9 |
| 2023-2025  | 303.0% | 16.6% | 242.0% | -0.0 | 45.9 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $51.95
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $50.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $46.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $39.50

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend, although the recent price drop of -$1.98 indicates short-term weakness.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 77.34 (Overbought territory; suggests potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.64 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -2.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -1.1% (Potential for lower returns than the S&P 500 over the long term, based on current data and market conditions).  This needs further analysis considering historical data and growth prospects.

The recent price drop of -$1.98 might be related to the negative expected return and the overall market conditions. It doesn't indicate a dramatic plunge.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

HOOD has shown significant positive surprises in EPS compared to expectations in recent quarters (Q2 2024 and Q1 2024 especially).  However, Q3 2024 results showed a smaller than expected beat. The previous quarter showed a net loss (-$0.09).  This suggests some inconsistency in earnings performance.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.17  | $0.18        |

| 2024-05-08 | $0.18  | $0.06        |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.03  | $0.006       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HOOD's performance has been exceptionally volatile, with periods of significant outperformance against the S&P 500 followed by periods of underperformance. While recent earnings have shown positive surprises, the sustainability of this growth and the overall profitability remain uncertain.  Technical indicators suggest potential for short-term correction.  The long-term outlook depends on the company's ability to maintain its growth trajectory and improve its overall profitability and efficiency.  Further investigation into the factors contributing to the volatility and the sharp drop in Q4 2023 ROE is crucial before making investment decisions.  The extremely high cumulative return compared to the S&P 500 should be viewed with caution, considering its volatility.  A thorough due diligence process involving a deeper dive into the financial statements and competitive landscape is recommended before any investment.
