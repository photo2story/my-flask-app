## Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows that the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and the benchmark S&P 500 index have nearly identical cumulative returns (130.06%).  The divergence is 0.0, indicating virtually no deviation.  The Alpha consistently remains at 0.0 across all periods, confirming that VOO's performance closely tracks the S&P 500.  The Beta is consistently 1.0, showing perfect correlation with the market.  VOO is a passively managed ETF designed to mirror the S&P 500, so this is expected.

**Company Overview:** VOO is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 index, offering investors broad exposure to 500 of the largest publicly traded US companies.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $553.45 (Last Market: $554.54)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $550.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $543.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $531.01

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.  However, the relatively small difference between the price and the 5-day moving average suggests limited recent momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.58 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.07 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but very weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (-): Indicates a recent downward trend in relative performance, though the NaN value prevents a definitive conclusion.  Further data is needed.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This is likely a placeholder or reflecting the passive nature of the ETF tracking a benchmark index; long-term returns are dependent on market performance.  No specific outperformance is expected over the S&P 500 itself.)

The last market price of $554.54 is not significantly different from the closing price to suggest a rapid upswing or downswing.


**4.  Financial Information:**

No detailed financial trends are available for VOO in the provided data.  VOO, as a passively managed index fund, does not have the same kind of financial statements as an actively managed company.  Its performance is directly tied to the underlying S&P 500 index.


**5. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided data lacks information on recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions.  This is crucial information for a comprehensive analysis and should be obtained from reliable financial news sources.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

VOO, as expected for an S&P 500 tracking ETF, exhibits performance closely aligned with the benchmark index.  Technical indicators suggest a slightly bullish sentiment but lack strong conviction. The absence of financial statement data is expected given VOO's nature.  The lack of recent news and market outlook information limits the completeness of the analysis.  To improve this report, please provide relevant news articles, earnings reports, and analyst opinions.  Furthermore, clarifying the NaN value for relative divergence change is necessary for a better understanding of recent performance trends.  For long-term investment (2+ years), the expected return over the S&P 500 is essentially zero, given the ETF's passive tracking nature.  However, diversification benefits and low expense ratios are key advantages.
