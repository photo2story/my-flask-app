**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is the rate of return that would be required for an investment to grow from its initial to its final value, assuming the profits were reinvested at the end of each year of the investmentâ€™s lifespan. It has fluctuated significantly over the observed periods, ranging from a low of 2.0% (2020-2022) to a high of 58.0% (2023-2025). This indicates considerable variability in the investment's annual growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the specified period. The MDD values are relatively high, ranging from 54.2% to 70.4%. This suggests the investment has experienced significant volatility and potential for substantial losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the performance of an investment compared to a benchmark index (in this case, the S&P 500), where a positive alpha indicates outperformance, and a negative alpha indicates underperformance. The Alpha is consistently 0.0% across all periods, which implies that the investment's returns have mirrored the S&P 500's returns. In other words, the investment has not generated any excess return above the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the volatility of an investment compared to the overall market (S&P 500). A beta of 1.0 indicates that the investment's price tends to move in the same direction and magnitude as the market. In this case, the Beta is consistently 1.0, which means that the investment has exhibited volatility similar to the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B) (Capital in Billions):** Cap(B) represents the market capitalization of the investment in billions of dollars. It has generally increased over time, rising from $551.7 billion in 2015-2017 to $1369.6 billion in 2023-2025. This indicates that the investment has grown substantially in value over the years.
