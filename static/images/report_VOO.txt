* **Closing Price:** $472.37
* **Previous Close:** $483.90
* **Change:** -$2.38 (a -0.49% decrease)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $485.81
* **20-day Moving Average:** $497.02
* **60-day Moving Average:** $525.70

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price decrease is relatively modest (-0.49%).


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.37 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.041 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (no significant change)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates no expected excess return over the S&P 500 based on the provided data, implying that future returns are expected to mirror the S&P 500)


The relatively low RSI, negative PPO, and price below moving averages suggest a bearish short-term outlook. However, given the long-term nature of the S&P 500 and VOO's tracking nature,  a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy could still be reasonable, with an expected return aligned with the overall market performance of the S&P 500.  The provided 0% expected return implies no significant outperformance is anticipated.  This analysis solely reflects the past data and should not be considered financial advice.  Further analysis and consideration of other factors are recommended before any investment decision.
