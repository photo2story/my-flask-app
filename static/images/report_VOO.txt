2025-12-28 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided data, along with analysis, as requested:

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker to review:** VOO
*   **Company Name:** Vanguard S&P 500
*   **Company Overview:** Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) is an exchange-traded fund designed to track the performance of the S&P 500 index, providing broad exposure to the U.S. large-cap equity market.
*   **Cumulative return of review stock:** 103.21043941542952
*   **Cumulative return of comparison stock (S&P 500, VOO):** 103.21043941542952
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Max: 0.0
    *   Min: 0.0
    *   Current: 0.0
    *   Relative divergence: 0.0

    **Analysis:** The returns are identical, as expected, because the review stock *is* the comparison stock (VOO tracks the S&P 500). The divergence is therefore zero across the board.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 28.0%  | 65.7%  | 0.0%  | 1.0  | 571.1  |
| 2016-2018  | 15.0%  | 69.5%  | 0.0%  | 1.0  | 535.1  |
| 2017-2019  | 22.0%  | 70.2%  | 0.0%  | 1.0  | 688.8  |
| 2018-2020  | 24.0%  | 79.8%  | 0.0%  | 1.0  | 800.3  |
| 2019-2021  | 47.0%  | 79.8%  | 0.0%  | 1.0  | 1016.5 |
| 2020-2022  | -1.0%  | 80.5%  | 0.0%  | 1.0  | 818.1  |
| 2021-2023  | 1.0%   | 80.5%  | 0.0%  | 1.0  | 1017.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 21.0%  | 80.5%  | 0.0%  | 1.0  | 1254.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 68.0%  | 79.9%  | 0.0%  | 1.0  | 1478.2 |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over the period.  Notice the variability from -1.0% to a high of 68.0%.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. These are very high drawdowns, indicating significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:** 0.0% consistently means there's no outperformance relative to the benchmark (which makes sense, as it *is* the benchmark).
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 1.0 consistently signifies that the stock's volatility is the same as the market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in Billions. Shows the massive and growing size of VOO.

**Analysis:** The data highlights the inherent volatility of the market. While CAGR varies, the consistent Beta of 1.0 and Alpha of 0.0 reinforces that VOO closely tracks the S&P 500. The increasing market cap reflects the increasing investment in the S&P 500. The Maximum Drawdown data is quite large and shows risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 634.8400268554688
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 634.84, 'previousClose': 634.78, 'change': 0.01}
*   **5-day SMA:** 631.916
*   **20-day SMA:** 628.4005
*   **60-day SMA:** 621.1411

    **Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, and the 20-day SMA is above the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term and mid-term upward trend. The relatively small *change* of 0.01 from the previous close indicates price stability.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 55.21036193543775
*   **PPO:** 0.0932
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash\_0%\_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **If {'price': 634.84, 'previousClose': 634.78, 'change': 0.01} is large, reflect the fluctuation issue (sharp rebound, sharp decline).**
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0, Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.

    **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI of 1.0:** Indicates a very favorable market environment for investment, according to this indicator.
    *   **RSI of 55.21:** Suggests a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment. An RSI above 70 is generally considered overbought, and below 30 is oversold.
    *   **PPO of 0.0932:** This is a very low reading, and while positive, close to zero.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** It recommends a fully invested position, reinforcing the bullish sentiment.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The "short-term decline" is a point of concern, although the small change in price does not show any major risks.
    *   **Expected Return of 0.0%:** Again, highlights that you shouldn't expect to *outperform* the S&P 500 with VOO. It will likely provide returns very close to the index itself.

*   **Analyst Consensus: (Not provided in the input data).**

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

In summary, the data presents a generally positive outlook for VOO (and, by extension, the S&P 500).

*   **Performance:** VOO mirrors the S&P 500 exactly, as expected. The Alpha/Beta data confirms this. The CAGR values show how return rates may change over time and the MDD indicates the level of risk in each period of time.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The price is above its moving averages, RSI is neutral to slightly bullish, and the MRI suggests a favorable investment environment. The recent relative divergence change suggests a short-term decline.
*   **News:** The news is mixed, with some articles highlighting potential risks (tariffs, market declines) and others emphasizing positive aspects (record inflows, near record highs). The news also shows some are considering alternatives within the S\&P500 and the story of small-dollar investing reinforcing VOO's accessibility for long-term investing.
*   **Recommendation:** The Hybrid Signal recommends a fully invested position. Given the overall positive indicators, continuing to hold or even add to a VOO position could be considered, but one must be cognizant of the inherent risks and volatility of the stock market as demonstrated by MDD.

Important considerations:

*   **Diversification:** While VOO provides broad market exposure, it's essential to ensure your *overall* portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** VOO is generally considered a long-term investment. Short-term market fluctuations are to be expected.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. The MDD numbers show there may be great losses to an investment.
