    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over the periods.  Notice the high CAGR for 2023-2025.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  Lower MDD is better, indicating less risk.  MDD has generally decreased in recent periods.
    *   **Alpha:**  Consistently 0.0, meaning the investment's performance aligns precisely with the benchmark (S&P 500).
    *   **Beta:** Consistently 1.0, confirming the investment's volatility is the same as the market (S&P 500).
    *   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** Shows the fund's size, generally increasing over time.  This suggests consistent investment flow into the fund.

    *   **Analysis:** This data confirms that the review stock mirrors the S&P 500 very closely.  The increasing capitalization and reasonable MDD figures suggest healthy and relatively stable growth.  The strong CAGR for the most recent period (2023-2025) is a positive signal.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 627.1300048828125
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 627.13, 'previousClose': 631.72, 'change': -0.73}
*   **5-day SMA:** 632.214
*   **20-day SMA:** 628.928
*   **60-day SMA:** 621.8513

    *   The closing price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day SMAs but above the 60-day SMA. This suggests a possible short-term downtrend, but it remains above the longer-term trend.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 44.16614636204424 (Neutral)

*   **Price Change:** {'price': 627.13, 'previousClose': 631.72, 'change': -0.73}
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

    *   **MRI:** The high MRI suggests the market is considered relatively safe for investment based on the model.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 44 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO suggests possible recent weakness in the price.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying, indicating a bullish sentiment based on the combined indicators.
    *   **Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend, supporting the buy signal.
    *   **Price Change:** The negative price change suggests a slight downward movement in the most recent trading session, which may contradict the divergence change signal.
    *   **Expected Return:** The expected return of 0.0% seems odd, suggesting that the model may be predicting that VOO will perform exactly like the S&P500, or is perhaps not very decisive in the short-term. This information must be reconfirmed.
