**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 520.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 511.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 491.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 518.60

The price is slightly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a moderately bullish short-term trend.  However, it's significantly above the 20-day moving average, indicating a recent price increase.  The difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average suggests a recent upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 69.40 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.99 (Positive momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (No significant short-term divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (The expected return is stated as 0.0%; this may require further clarification or data).  Given the historical performance data showing a tight correlation with the S&P 500,  long-term (2+ years)  excess returns relative to the S&P 500 are unlikely, unless unexpected market shifts occur.

The current price shows a positive change of 1.43 from the previous close (513.35 to 520.71).  While not a drastic jump, it contributes to the recent upward trend.  The RSI nearing 70 suggests potential short-term overbought conditions; however, the PPO's positive value confirms positive momentum.  The lack of significant short-term relative divergence suggests a relatively consistent price movement.  The stated 0.0% expected return needs further context.  Given its index-tracking nature, VOO's long-term expected return should closely align with the S&P 500's projected growth, not offer a significant outperformance.
