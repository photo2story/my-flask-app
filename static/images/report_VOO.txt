**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators and Divergence/Expected Return:**

*   RSI: 52.08410259512614
*   PPO: -0.1171
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   If {'price': 629.73, 'previousClose': 625.789, 'change': 0.63} is large, reflect the fluctuation issue (sharp rebound, sharp decline).
*   Expected Return (%): 0.0, Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.8 indicates a medium level of risk, suggesting that the current market conditions are reasonably favorable for investment.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 52.08 is in the neutral range (30-70), suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO (-0.1171) suggests that the shorter-term moving average is slightly below the longer-term moving average. This may indicate a slight downward trend or consolidation.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying 100% of available cash, which aligns with the "Very Safe" classification and the MRI.  The recommendation for monthly investment further reinforces a buy-and-hold strategy.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The "단기하락" (short-term decline) suggests a slight negative trend in recent performance relative to its historical range.
*   **Price Change Note:** The note highlights that significant price changes between the previous close and current price should be evaluated to determine if it is a sharp rebound or decline.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected excess return of 0.0% compared to the S&P 500 is consistent with an index-tracking ETF.  VOO is designed to *match* the S&P 500's performance, not exceed it.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

VOO is performing exactly as expected, mirroring the S&P 500 index.  Recent technical indicators show a slightly positive short-term trend, with the price above its moving averages. The MRI suggests a medium level of risk, and the hybrid signal recommends a fully invested position.
