*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Ranges from 10.5% to 18.8%, indicating the largest peak-to-trough decline during each period.  This is a measure of risk.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 634.06
*   **Last-market:** Price 638.31, Previous Close 634.06, Change 0.67
*   **5-day SMA:** 632.75
*   **20-day SMA:** 629.85
*   **60-day SMA:** 623.56

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently trading above all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This *could* suggest an upward trend.  However, SMAs are lagging indicators and should be used in conjunction with other analysis.  The "Last-market" data showing a slight positive change indicates a small, recent upward movement.

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 (Compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI of 0.7:** Suggests a medium level of risk in the current market environment, warranting careful consideration before investing.
*   **RSI of 71.34:**  Indicates that the stock is nearing "overbought" territory (typically above 70).  This *could* suggest a potential pullback is possible, but it doesn't guarantee one.
*   **PPO of 0.0141:** A slightly positive PPO suggests a slight upward trend in momentum. However, the value is very small, indicating the momentum isn't particularly strong.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends buying (with 0% cash reserve, which is fully invested).
*   **Recent divergence change of 0.0:** Indicates the stock has been recently underperforming the comparison S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return of 0.0%:** Suggests the model doesn't project any significant outperformance *relative to the S&P 500* over a long-term horizon.
