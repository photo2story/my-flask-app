*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR shows a wide range, from a negative return (-1.0%) in 2020-2022 to a high of 65% in 2023-2025, reflecting the volatility of the market.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is very high across all periods, ranging from 65.7% to 80.5%.  This indicates significant potential for loss from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently 0.0%, meaning that the investment hasn't outperformed its benchmark (which we already know is VOO, the S&P 500).
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently 1.0, confirming that the investment's volatility is the same as the market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):**  The capitalization has generally increased over time, indicating growth in the size of the underlying holdings.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 627.5599975585938
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 634.78, 'previousClose': 632.67, 'change': 0.33}
*   **5-day SMA:** 623.402
*   **20-day SMA:** 625.111
*   **60-day SMA:** 619.7251

**Analysis:**

*   The most recent market price (634.78) is above the close price of 627.55.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the current market price. This suggests a recent upward trend. The 60-day SMA being lower than both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs further reinforces this.
*   The last market data shows a small positive change (0.33), indicating a slight upward movement in the most recent trading session.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 52.08410259512614
*   **PPO:** -0.1171
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락
*   **Price Fluctuation Note:** The positive change of 0.33 might reflect a small fluctuation issue.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term from this point.)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.8 suggests a medium level of risk and indicates that investment is reasonably recommended at this time.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 52.08 is neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -0.1171 indicates that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, suggesting a weak downward trend, but not significantly.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests buying 100% of available cash, indicating a bullish outlook, albeit with a very conservative suggestion to invest only 0.8% of the total investment monthly. This contrasts somewhat with the Medium risk rating from the MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:**  "단기하락" translates to "short-term decline." This contradicts with what "2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations" showed as a recent upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0.0% compared to the S&P 500 suggests no anticipated outperformance; the expectation is to track the index.

*   **[2025-12-24]** Stock Market Live December 24: S&P 500 (VOO) Flat Ahead of Christmas - 24/7 Wall St.

*   **[2025-12-22]** VTI Is Likely To Lag The S&P 500 In 2026 - Seeking Alpha

**Analysis:**

*   The news headlines indicate a mixed outlook. Some articles suggest stability ("Flat Ahead of Christmas", "Rise Is No Surprise"), while others compare VOO to other investment options (QQQ - tech focused, SPY - another S&P 500 ETF, VTI - Total Stock Market ETF).
*   The consistent comparisons (VOO vs. QQQ, SPY, VTI) suggest that investors are actively evaluating different investment strategies and considering the S&P 500 as a benchmark.
*   The article about the California man investing $8 daily highlights the accessibility and appeal of VOO to smaller, everyday investors.
*   The Seeking Alpha article, while not directly about VOO's underperformance, implies by converse that the S&P 500 should do fine next year, comparatively.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

The data paints a picture of an investment that closely mirrors the S&P 500 (VOO). This is confirmed by the equal cumulative return, Alpha of 0.0, and Beta of 1.0. The historical data shows periods of strong growth and drawdowns, reflecting market volatility. Recent indicators show a mixed outlook:

*   **Positive Signals:** The recent upward price trend, and the Hybrid Signal's "Buy" suggestion indicates optimism.
*   **Cautionary Signals:** The high MDD from the past periods suggests significant potential downside. The neutral RSI and slightly negative PPO suggests uncertainty in the trend.
*   **News Context:** The news headlines reflect a general awareness of the S&P 500 as a core investment option, with comparisons to other ETFs highlighting the need for investors to consider their risk tolerance and investment goals.

**Overall:** The investment appears to be a reliable way to track the S&P 500. Investors should be aware of the historical volatility (high MDD) and consider their own risk tolerance. The slightly bullish signals mixed with the "short-term decline" indicator warrant careful monitoring of the market trends. The lack of expected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 means investors should choose this option primarily for its diversification and benchmark-tracking capabilities, not for exceptional returns.
