## Report: Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) Analysis

**1. Performance Overview & Comparison:**

VOO, tracking the S&P 500, is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that aims to provide broad market exposure to large-cap US equities.  

The provided data shows that both VOO and the benchmark S&P 500 have a cumulative return of 85.20%.  Therefore, the divergence between the two is 0.0. The  relative divergence is also 0.0, indicating no significant deviation from the benchmark.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data reveals relatively stable performance over the years, with some fluctuations.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) consistently shows 0.0%, which suggests this data may not fully represent the potential risks in the past. Alpha consistently at 1.0 implies the fund's performance closely mirrors the market, with beta also at 1.0. Market capitalization increased steadily over time, reflecting market growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $509.74
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $506.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $490.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $519.78

The closing price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent upward momentum. However, it is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downtrend within a longer-term trend.  The recent price change of $0.05 from the previous close is negligible and does not signal a dramatic shift.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3721 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.77 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.90 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (No significant change in relative strength)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests no expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 at this specific time point.  This is likely a snapshot and should not be interpreted as a definitive prediction.)


The relatively low MRI suggests moderate risk.  The RSI and PPO indicators show a slightly positive outlook, although not strongly bullish. The lack of recent relative divergence change implies stability, and the small price change from the previous close doesnâ€™t suggest any major market events, such as a sharp rise or fall.  The expected return of 0.0% indicates that, based on this limited data, no outperformance is expected compared to the S&P 500 in the long term.  However, it's crucial to remember that long-term investment predictions require more extensive data analysis and consideration of broader economic factors.  This 0.0% projection is a point-in-time estimate, and future market performance will vary.
