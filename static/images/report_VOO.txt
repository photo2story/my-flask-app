2025-12-13 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of the provided stock data, broken down into the requested sections:

**1) Return Rate Comparison (vs. VOO)**

*   **Ticker to review:** Provided Data
*   **Company Name:**  N/A (Since this appears to be a model output, we don't have an actual company name. This represents the investment strategy tested.)
*   **Overview:** This data reflects the performance of a specific investment strategy.
*   **Cumulative return of review stock:** 102.3747092405944
*   **Cumulative return of comparison stock (S&P 500, VOO):** 102.3747092405944
*   **Divergence (max: 0.7, min: 0.0, current: 0.7, relative divergence: 100.0)**
*   **Analysis:** The cumulative return is identical to VOO.  The divergence is currently at its maximum historical level. This indicates that, although the cumulative performance is the same, the specific path taken to achieve that return has experienced some periods of lower performance than the index. The relative divergence being at 100% suggests the performance is diverging more now than it has at any other time in the lookback period. Given the cumulative return is same, this difference is likely to be small.

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR is variable and ranges widely based on the time period.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The maximum drawdown is consistently high, ranging from 65.7% to 80.5%. This means the strategy has experienced significant peak-to-trough declines.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently 0.0%.  This indicates the strategy has not outperformed the S&P 500 index on a risk-adjusted basis during these periods.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is consistently 1.0. This suggests the strategy's volatility is the same as the S&P 500.
    *   **Cap(B):** This shows the capitalization size (in Billions) over the time period. It has grown.

    **Analysis:**  The data suggests this investment strategy mirrors the S&P 500 in terms of volatility (Beta of 1) but doesn't generate any excess return (Alpha of 0). The high maximum drawdowns indicate substantial risk during market downturns, which the strategy hasn't been able to mitigate.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 632.22998046875
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 626.87, 'previousClose': 633.71, 'change': -1.08}
*   **5-day SMA:** 629.742
*   **20-day SMA:** 620.8385
*   **60-day SMA:** 617.9075

    **Analysis:** The current price (626.87) is below the last close, the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This *could* indicate a short-term downward trend. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, however the last market close is below all three, so may signal a change.

**3) RSI, PPO Index, and Other Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 72.08057367369558
*   **PPO:** 0.1834
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **If {'price': 626.87, 'previousClose': 633.71, 'change': -1.08} is large, reflect the fluctuation issue (sharp rebound, sharp decline).**
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0, Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.

    **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk is perceived.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 72.08 indicates the stock is nearing overbought conditions. This *could* suggest a potential pullback is coming.
    *   **PPO:**  The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.1834 being positive suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, but it is close to zero and may indicate a flat signal.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The model is currently recommending to invest all available cash.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The short-term decline (단기하락) aligns with the price fluctuations observed earlier.
    *   **Expected Return:** The expected return of 0.0% and zero expected excess return over the S&P 500 is consistent with the Alpha data, suggesting the strategy is not expected to outperform the index.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

The data suggests this investment strategy has a history of mirroring the S&P 500's performance, volatility (Beta = 1), and expected returns (Alpha = 0.0%). However, it experiences high maximum drawdowns, suggesting significant potential for losses during market downturns, without outperforming the index during upturns. Recent data points toward a possible short-term decline, with the price falling below its moving averages and the RSI approaching overbought levels. The MRI indicates a medium investment recommendation. The hybrid signal is recommending buying. The recent news highlights general market trends affecting the S&P 500. Without knowing more about the specific strategy, it's difficult to determine its true value proposition beyond replicating S&P 500 performance with potentially higher volatility. There is a "divergence" signal that suggests the strategy's relative performance is unusually different recently, indicating more analysis is necessary.
