*   **20-day SMA:** 628.9045

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI of 0.8:** Suggests a medium level of risk in the market, generally favoring investment.

*   **PPO of -0.046:** A negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a possible downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying, aligning with the Medium Risk indication of the MRI. The 0% cash ratio suggests a fully invested strategy.
*   **Divergence Change:** Indicates a recent (20-day) short-term decline in relative performance.
