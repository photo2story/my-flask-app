**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 464.68
* **Last Market Price:** 465.52 (a decrease of -5.8 from the previous close of 494.16)

* **20-Day Moving Average:** 513.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 535.97

The price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), suggesting a downward trend. The recent significant price drop (-5.8) indicates a sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4782 (High Risk category)  This suggests a relatively high level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 23.31 (Significantly below 30, indicating oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -0.65 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-)  The lack of change in the short-term relative divergence suggests continued downward pressure, though it does not give specific information.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0%  This indicates no expected excess return relative to the S&P 500.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy in VOO is expected to provide returns similar to the overall market, as is intended by its design.

**Conclusion:**

VOO has tracked the S&P 500 index very closely.  However, recent price action shows a sharp decline and indicators suggest an oversold market with a high risk profile. While the long-term outlook for a broadly diversified market index fund like VOO remains generally positive, the current situation warrants caution. The 0% expected return reflects the expectation of mirroring the S&P 500, not an outperformance.  The substantial recent price drop should be considered in any investment decision.
