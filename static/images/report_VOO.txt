The provided data shows a cumulative return of 85.44% for both VOO and the benchmark S&P 500.  Therefore, the divergence is 0.0.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

The table presents the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and market capitalization (Cap(B)) of VOO over different time periods.  Noteworthy is the consistent Beta of 1.0, confirming the ETF's close tracking of the S&P 500.

* **Relative Strength Divergence (20-day):** 0.0 (-) (Short-term bearish trend).
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests no expected alpha or outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term based on the provided data.  Note that this is not a prediction of future performance).


**Conclusion:**

The recent price drop in VOO, coupled with the negative technical indicators (RSI, PPO), suggests potential near-term downside risk. However, given the long-term historical performance closely tracking the S&P 500 and the low to medium risk profile, a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy with regular contributions might still be considered, understanding that returns will likely mirror the market's overall performance rather than providing outsized gains. The significant one day drop should be investigated to understand potential impacting factors.  More comprehensive analysis, including fundamental analysis and consideration of wider economic factors, is necessary before making any investment decisions.
