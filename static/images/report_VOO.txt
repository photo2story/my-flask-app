## Analysis of VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)

**0. Overview:**

VOO is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 index, providing broad exposure to the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the US.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

The provided data shows a significant underperformance of the reviewed asset compared to the VOO (S&P 500).  The cumulative return of the reviewed asset is 0.0%, while VOO's cumulative return is 83.89%.  This results in a divergence of -83.9%.  The relative divergence of -18.9% indicates that the reviewed asset's performance is significantly below the VOO, placing it in the lower percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500. The Alpha of 1.0 suggests it performed identically to its benchmark, however, this contradicts the provided cumulative return data; further investigation is required to reconcile these discrepancies. The provided Beta of 1.0 indicates a similar volatility to the market.  The consistently high maximum drawdown (MDD) across all periods highlights significant risk involved in this particular asset.


**Table Analysis:**

The table shows that the reviewed asset has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 across all periods (2015-2025), exhibiting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 0% and substantial negative Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  The consistently high MDD indicates significant volatility and potential for substantial losses.  The consistently high market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows the asset's significant size.  The Alpha and Beta values require further investigation due to the discrepancies with observed performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 506.11
* **5-day Moving Average:** 491.45
* **20-day Moving Average:** 491.253
* **60-day Moving Average:** 521.914

The closing price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent short-term upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downtrend.  The recent increase of 0.74 (from 502.41 to 506.11) suggests a minor price upswing.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.0 (Low Risk)
* **RSI:** 64.52 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.69 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.7% (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return:** -281.5% This extremely negative expected return necessitates significant clarification, as itâ€™s highly unusual and potentially erroneous.  If this figure reflects the asset's projected performance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), it suggests a significant underperformance.

The discrepancy between the positive PPO and negative relative divergence warrants further investigation. The extremely negative expected return of -281.5% needs immediate clarification and validation. This figure is unrealistic unless a specific, highly unusual scenario is assumed. The provided data presents significant inconsistencies and requires more information for reliable analysis.


**Conclusion:**

The provided data highlights significant underperformance of the reviewed asset compared to the VOO (S&P 500).  High MDDs and a vastly negative projected return raise serious concerns regarding the asset's risk profile.  The inconsistencies within the data (Alpha/Beta vs. cumulative return, and the expected return) necessitate further investigation and clarification before drawing definitive conclusions.  The provided data alone does not support any investment recommendations.
