A Beta of 1.0 consistently indicates that the fund's price movements mirror the S&P 500. An Alpha of 0.0 suggests no significant outperformance relative to the benchmark.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 506.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 491.45
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 491.253
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 521.914

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term correction from a higher point.  The recent price change of 0.74 indicates a slight upward movement (0.15%).


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3909 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 64.52 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting some overbought conditions.)
* **PPO:** 0.69 (Positive value indicates an upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-)  (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -0.0% (The provided data does not support a meaningful prediction.  Over the long term (2+ years), the expected return is likely to align with the overall market return of the S&P 500, unless significant market changes occur.)

The slight price increase reflects a modest upward movement, not a significant rapid increase or decrease.  Given the long-term nature of the S&P 500 and the ETF's tracking nature,  long-term (2+ years) returns will likely closely track the S&P 500's performance, with minimal expected outperformance.  The negative expected return is likely a reflection of the short-term market conditions rather than an inherent characteristic of the fund itself.
