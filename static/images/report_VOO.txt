*   **20-Day Relative Tracking Difference Change:** 0.0 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 (Outperformance vs. S&P 500 when investing long term)

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:**  A value of 0.8 suggests a medium level of market risk, advising caution but not discouraging investment.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 48.43 is neutral. It's neither overbought (above 70) nor oversold (below 30), suggesting balanced buying and selling pressure.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of -0.2362 suggests that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average.  This also hints at a potential short-term pullback, but it's a weak signal.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The 'Buy' signal with a caution flag, and the 0% cash ratio suggests a bullish stance with a recognition of potential risks.
    *   **20-Day Relative Tracking Difference Change:** The negative change in tracking difference aligns with the PPO and reinforces the idea of a potential short-term dip.
    *   **Expected Return:** A 0.0% expected return over the S&P 500 suggests that the model doesn't predict VOO to outperform the index in the long run. This aligns with the fundamental nature of an S&P 500 tracking ETF.
