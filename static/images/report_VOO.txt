## Report: Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) Performance Analysis

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison:**

The provided data shows that Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which tracks the S&P 500 index,  is a passively managed exchange-traded fund that aims to provide broad market exposure to 500 large-cap US companies.

The cumulative return for VOO is 66.94087207629416%, virtually identical to the benchmark S&P 500's return of 66.94087207629411%.  The divergence between the two is negligible (0.0%).  Therefore, VOO has effectively tracked the S&P 500 index over the measured period.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently low alpha values (0.0%) across all periods.  A beta of 1.0 indicates that the VOO's price movements mirror the S&P 500, which is expected given its index-tracking nature. The Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth over the years.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) remains relatively stable around 60-70%, implying this period includes some significant market corrections but VOO largely follows market trends. CAGR values show variable returns based on market conditions.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 499.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 475.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 507.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 532.89

The closing price is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. The 5-day moving average being significantly lower than the other averages indicates a recent price drop.  The large positive change from the previous close (`{'price': 499.1, 'previousClose': 456.74, 'change': 9.27}`) indicates a recent, significant price increase (a 'jump' rather than a gradual increase).

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)  This indicates higher-than-average market volatility.
* **RSI:** 43.19 (Slightly below neutral, suggesting potential for further downside.)
* **PPO:** -0.70 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (-)  Recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0%  The provided data does not support an expected return beyond tracking the S&P 500.  Given its index-tracking nature, long-term expected returns for VOO should mirror the expected returns of the S&P 500, which historically average around 7-10% annually, although not guaranteed and subject to market fluctuations.  Therefore, no significant alpha (outperformance) is anticipated.


**Conclusion:**

VOO has closely tracked the S&P 500, exhibiting a beta of 1.0 and negligible alpha. Recent price action shows a short-term downward trend following a significant price jump.  Technical indicators suggest a currently high-risk market environment with bearish momentum, although the recent price increase might indicate short-term volatility in a larger long-term trend.  Long-term investment in VOO would be expected to mirror the performance of the S&P 500, with no substantial outperformance.
