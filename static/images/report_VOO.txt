## Report on Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)

**1. Performance Analysis:**

The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) tracks the S&P 500 index, representing a broad basket of large-cap US equities.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 89.25% for both VOO and the S&P 500 index, resulting in a **divergence of 0.0%**.  This indicates the ETF closely mirrored the index's performance.

The Alpha consistently measures 0.0, indicating that VOO's performance exactly matched the benchmark (S&P 500). The Beta is 1.0, showing perfect correlation with the benchmark's volatility.  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) varies year-to-year, ranging from 6.0% to 73.0%, reflecting market fluctuations.  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) are relatively low, generally below 9%.  Market capitalization (Cap) shows a steady increase over the analyzed period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 510.8
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 522.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 520.40
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 539.19

The current closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term. The recent slight increase (0.12 change) is insignificant compared to the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.85 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.17 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, although relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (indicates no significant divergence).
* **Expected Return:** 0.0%  The provided data doesn't offer any information supporting an expected return exceeding the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) accumulation investing.   A 0.0% expected return simply means no additional gain beyond the S&P 500 index performance is projected based on the given information.


**Conclusion:**

VOO has closely tracked the S&P 500 index, exhibiting low risk and moderate momentum. The slight decrease in price relative to its moving averages suggests a potentially short-term bearish trend. However, the limited data provided restricts any strong conclusions about future performance, and the expected return of 0.0% relative to the S&P 500 should be interpreted cautiously given data limitations. More comprehensive data and analysis are needed for robust predictions.
