**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Table:**

The provided table shows performance metrics for rolling three-year periods.

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is highly variable, ranging from a strong 66% (2023-2025) to a concerning -1% (2020-2022). This indicates significant performance swings.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, hovering around 70-80%. This suggests significant volatility and potential for large losses during downturns. This is unusually high for an index fund tracking the S&P 500 and warrants further investigation (possible data errors).
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is mostly 0%, except for the 2023-2025 period (1%). This suggests that, for most periods, the investment did not outperform its benchmark (taking risk into account).
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently 1.0. This is expected for a fund tracking the S&P 500, indicating it moves in line with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap is consistently growing.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 628.7999877929688
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 630.48, 'previousClose': 629.3, 'change': 0.19}
*   **5-day SMA:** 626.9399
*   **20-day SMA:** 618.9295
*   **60-day SMA:** 615.8203

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 5-day SMA, which is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term upward trend.  The price change between the previous close and the last market price is small, indicating relatively stable recent trading.

**3) Analysis of RSI, PPO, Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, Expected_Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended) - Suggests a moderate level of risk in the current market environment.
*   **RSI:** 50.43636367766693 - This is a neutral RSI, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** 0.236 - The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being slightly positive suggests a slight upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01) - This signal suggests using all available cash to buy shares, and a small monthly investment. The "Very Safe" designation and MRI 0.90 seem somewhat contradictory given the MDD data, warranting caution.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline) - This indicates a recent weakening in performance relative to its prior trend.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 - No excess return expected compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **S&P 500 Flat, Netflix Down:** Multiple news sources report on the S&P 500's flat performance and Netflix's decline due to HBO deal costs. This indicates broader market stability but specific sector weaknesses.
*   **$1,000 Investment 10 Years Ago:**  Motley Fool article highlights the potential returns of investing in VOO over a 10-year period. This is generally a positive, long-term focused message.
*   **'VOO and Chill' Losing Appeal:** CNBC article questions the "VOO and chill" strategy, even with market highs. This suggests that investors may be seeking alternative strategies for potentially higher returns or risk mitigation.
*   **Daily Update:** Routine updates provide investors with information about recent price fluctuations and trading volumes.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** *Data missing from this part. To be completed.*

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

The analysis paints a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:**  The short-term trend is slightly upward based on SMA analysis. The MRI suggests a moderate investment environment. Long-term investments in VOO have historically yielded good returns, as highlighted by the Motley Fool article. The high CAGR values over the rolling three-year periods indicate the potential for significant growth.
*   **Negatives/Concerns:** The extremely high MDD figures are a major concern and require verification. The "VOO and chill" strategy is being questioned, suggesting investors may be looking for more dynamic approaches. The zero expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 might deter investors seeking higher returns. The recent short-term decline in relative divergence is a caution signal. The most recent articles regarding the S&P 500 being Flat, with Netflix down, suggest the volatility should be expected in the stock market.

**Summary Recommendation:**

Due to the contradictory nature of the data, a strong recommendation is not possible. The high MDD values are especially concerning. Investors should:

1.  **Verify the MDD Data:** Ensure the Maximum Drawdown figures are accurate, as they are unusually high for an S&P 500 tracking ETF. If they are accurate, this investment carries significant risk.
2.  **Consider Risk Tolerance:** If the MDD values are correct, this investment is only suitable for investors with a very high risk tolerance who can withstand significant potential losses.
3.  **Monitor News & Analyst Sentiment:** Keep a close eye on market news and analyst ratings for the S&P 500 and VOO.
4.  **Diversification:** Do not allocate a disproportionate amount of your portfolio to this investment, especially if the high MDD is confirmed.
