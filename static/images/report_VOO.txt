*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over different periods. The CAGR varies significantly, reflecting market performance during those times.  The recent 2023-2025 period shows a substantial 65% CAGR.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  The MDD is consistently high (ranging from 65.7% to 80.5%), highlighting the inherent risk of market investments, particularly during downturns.
*   **Alpha:**  Consistently 0.0%. This is expected for an S&P 500 tracking fund, as it aims to replicate the index's performance, not outperform it.
*   **Beta:** Consistently 1.0.  This means the fund's volatility is the same as the S&P 500's.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):**  Shows the fund's assets under management, which have generally grown over time, indicating increased investment in the S&P 500 through VOO.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 627.5599975585938
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 627.56, 'previousClose': 622.01, 'change': 0.89}
*   **5-day SMA:** 623.402
*   **20-day SMA:** 625.111
*   **60-day SMA:** 619.7251

**Analysis of Price Fluctuations:**

*   The current closing price (627.56) is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  It is also above the 60-day SMA, indicating a longer-term upward trend as well.
*   The positive change from the previous close (0.89) confirms recent positive momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence Change, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 52.08410259512614
*   **PPO:** -0.1171
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.7 suggests a medium level of risk, indicating that the market is considered reasonably healthy, but not without potential for downturns.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 52.08 suggests a neutral momentum; the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO (-0.1171) suggests that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, hinting at a minor downward trend or consolidation.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests investing 100% of cash, considering the investment as "Very Safe," and advises a monthly investment.  This seems contradictory to the 0.7 MRI reading, suggesting the hybrid signal might be overly optimistic or lagging in its assessment.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The "단기하락" (short-term decline) indication is concerning and should be monitored.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0.0% compared to the S&P 500 suggests no anticipated outperformance in the long term. This is consistent with VOO's nature as an index tracker.

VOO, as an S&P 500 tracking ETF, behaves as expected. Its performance mirrors the index, with a beta of 1 and zero alpha.

*   **Positive Points:**
    *   The stock is in a long-term and short-term uptrend, indicated by SMA figures.

    *   The recent (20 days) relative divergence change indicating "short-term decline" ("단기하락").

*   **Overall:** VOO remains a solid choice for investors seeking to match the S&P 500's performance.

The suggestion in the news articles to consider VXUS for potentially higher returns due to current market conditions is worth investigating further. Also, keep an eye on the "short-term decline" signal. Waiting for confirmation of a trend reversal might be prudent.
