## Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) Report

**1. Performance and Comparison:**

Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) tracks the S&P 500 index, providing broad exposure to the large-cap U.S. equity market.

The provided data shows a cumulative return of 89.4374% for VOO, virtually identical to the benchmark S&P 500's return of 89.4374%.  Therefore, the divergence is minimal:

* **Divergence:** (max: 0.0, min: 0.0, current: 0.0, relative divergence: 0.0)

The provided alpha and beta analysis indicates a beta consistently around 1.0 across various periods, suggesting the fund closely tracks the market.  While CAGR varies across different periods, it demonstrates the fund's exposure to market fluctuations.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) shows relatively low values over the selected periods.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) steadily increases which reflects the fund's growth. Note that the Alpha values of 0.0 across all periods are not very realistic for a market-tracking fund;  they suggest a possible error in the data.  


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 515.68
* **Last Market Price:** 515.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 516.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 518.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 538.47

The closing price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend. The price change of 0.37 from the previous close indicates a minor upward movement.

**3. Indicators and Analysis:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)  The MRI suggests a relatively moderate risk level.

* **RSI:** 52.78  The RSI is near the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.

* **PPO:** 0.11  A positive PPO suggests a bullish momentum, although a small value.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-)  The small negative change indicates a slight short-term downward trend.

* **Expected Return:** 0.0%  The provided expected return is 0%, which is unlikely for a long-term investment.  This needs further clarification or more detailed modeling.  A long-term (2+ years) investment in VOO would be expected to yield returns similar to the S&P 500's historical average, which is often in the range of 7-10% annually, although this is not guaranteed and past performance is not indicative of future results.  Given the near-perfect correlation with the S&P 500, any outperformance would be minimal and likely to average to zero over time. The provided 0% is likely an error.

**Conclusion:**

VOO has closely tracked the S&P 500, showing negligible divergence.  Recent price action shows a slight downward trend, but indicators are relatively neutral.  The provided expected return of 0% needs further investigation.  As an index fund, VOO isn't expected to significantly outperform the market.  A long-term investment strategy may yield returns consistent with the historical average of the S&P 500, but specific forecast requires more sophisticated models.
