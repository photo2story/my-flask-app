2025-12-28 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of the provided data, broken down into sections for clarity.

**1) Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** VOO
*   **Company Name:** Vanguard S&P 500 - Aims to track the performance of the S&P 500 index, representing large-cap U.S. stocks.

*   **Cumulative return of review stock:** 103.21043941542952
*   **Cumulative return of comparison stock (S&P 500, VOO):** 103.21043941542952
*   **Divergence:** (max: 0.0, min: 0.0, current: 0.0, relative divergence: 0.0)

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Data:**

The table provides a historical performance snapshot over rolling three-year periods. Key observations:

*   **Beta:** The Beta is consistently 1.0. This is expected for an S&P 500 tracking ETF like VOO, as it mirrors the market's volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is consistently 0.0. This is expected for an S&P 500 tracking ETF like VOO, as it mirrors the market's performance.
*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR varies significantly based on the period. Notice the high CAGR for 2019-2021 (47%) and 2023-2025 (68%) reflecting strong market performance during those times.  The negative CAGR for 2020-2022 reflects market downturns during that period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is very high (ranging from 65.7% to 80.5%).  This is unusual. It would be typical for the MDD of a stock to be closer to the 20-30% range, and the MDD of the S&P500 to be lower still. The high MDD figures indicate that the stock being analyzed had a significant drop at some point in the historical period. Since the "review stock" and VOO have the same cumulative return, there is a discrepancy between this table and the return comparison.
*   **Market Cap:** The market cap data shows the growth of the assets under management.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 634.8400268554688
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 634.84, 'previousClose': 634.78, 'change': 0.01}  (A negligible increase from the previous close)
*   **5-day SMA:** 631.916
*   **20-day SMA:** 628.4005
*   **60-day SMA:** 621.1411

**Analysis:**

The price is above all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 day). This *generally* suggests an upward trend in the short-term, medium-term, and long-term. The 5-day SMA being above the 20-day, and the 20-day above the 60-day reinforces this positive trend. However, the very small change from the previous close suggests a potential pause or consolidation in the upward momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 55.21036193543775 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.0932 (Neutral)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI suggests the model sees the market as relatively safe and conducive to investment. However, rely on this signal cautiously.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 55.2 is considered neutral. It doesn't indicate that the asset is overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30).
*   **PPO:** A PPO close to zero indicates little momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The buy signal suggests the model recommends investing a portion of cash now, and then recurring monthly investments.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The short-term decline indicated by the relative divergence change needs to be taken into consideration.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0.0% is concerning and requires further investigation.  It could indicate the model doesn't foresee substantial gains, or it could be a limitation of the model itself.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

*   **SPY vs. VOO:** This suggests an ongoing comparison between two popular S&P 500 ETFs, focusing on which is a better choice for investors.
*   **Stock Market Live (Tariffs):** This highlights a potential negative factor affecting the S&P 500 due to tariff concerns.
*   **VOO Inflows:** Record inflows suggest strong investor confidence in the S&P 500.
*   **California man who’s been investing $8 a day into VOO for 429 days shares how he’s got on**: This can potentially create more awareness for the stock.
*   **Stock Market Live (Nvidia/Groq):** This news indicates a specific event related to the technology sector (Nvidia), which could impact the S&P 500.

**Analysis of News:**

The news headlines present a mixed picture. Concerns about tariffs could negatively affect the market, while record inflows and comparisons favoring VOO over SPY are positive signals. The Nvidia/Groq news is sector-specific but relevant as tech companies often have a significant weighting in the S&P 500.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Overall, the analysis paints a somewhat uncertain picture. While the price is above its moving averages and the MRI suggests a good time to invest, the neutral RSI/PPO, short-term relative divergence decline, and 0% expected return raise concerns. The news headlines present both positive and negative catalysts. Also, there is a discrepancy between the MDD data and the return figures.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Investigate the Discrepancy:** The high MDD figures compared to the Cumulative Return data need to be addressed.
*   **Evaluate Risk Tolerance:** Despite the high MRI, assess your risk tolerance carefully given the mixed signals and short-term decline.
*   **Diversify:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes and sectors.
