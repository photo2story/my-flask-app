2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided data, followed by analysis.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker to review:** (Assuming the unnamed ticker is the same as VOO for simplicity, as the return rate is the same)
*   **Company Name:** Not specified, but assuming this represents a specific investment you are evaluating.
*   **VOO Company Overview:** Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is designed to track the performance of the S&P 500 index, representing large-cap U.S. stocks.
*   **Cumulative return of review stock:** 102.21%
*   **Cumulative return of comparison stock (S&P 500, VOO):** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Max: 0.0
    *   Min: 0.0
    *   Current: 0.0
    *   Relative Divergence: 0.0

**Analysis:**

Since the return rates are identical, the investment being reviewed has performed exactly in line with the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period in question. The divergence is zero across the board, indicating no difference in performance. This would occur if the "review stock" were also VOO.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
| :---------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :----- | :------- |
| 2024-2026 | 106.0% | 80.5% | 0.0%  | 1.0  | 1478.2 |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 106.0% - This signifies a very high average annual growth rate over the 2024-2026 period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 80.5% - This is a substantial potential loss from peak to trough. This suggests high volatility or risk.
*   **Alpha:** 0.0% - This indicates the investment has generated no excess return compared to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500 since Beta is 1.0).
*   **Beta:** 1.0 - This means the investment's volatility is the same as the market (S&P 500). It moves in line with the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap in Billions):** 1478.2 - This is the market capitalization of the investment.

**Analysis:**

The investment shows very high growth but also extremely high volatility. An MDD of 80.5% should raise serious concerns about the risk profile. Alpha of 0.0% confirms the investment's performance is essentially the same as the benchmark, with beta of 1 also confirm the behavior.

*   **20-day SMA:** 628.90
*   **60-day SMA:** 621.70

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price closed at 631.72, then the last market day's closing price was 629.98, showing a slight decrease (-0.28).
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA.  This suggests a recent upward trend, although the 5-day SMA being just slightly above the current price could indicate a possible near-term pullback. The stock is trading above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, confirming the trend.

*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point)

**Analysis:**
