The MRI suggests a high-risk environment.  The RSI is approaching oversold levels, suggesting potential for a bounce.

**Conclusion:**

VOO has closely tracked the S&P 500, showing minimal divergence.  Current technical indicators point towards a potentially bearish short-term outlook, though the long-term outlook remains aligned with the S&P 500.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy would likely mirror the S&P 500's performance given the historical data.  The high MRI indicates caution is warranted.
