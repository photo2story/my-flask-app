## Report: Analysis of Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)

**1. Performance Overview and Comparison:**

Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) tracks the S&P 500 index, representing a broad portfolio of large-cap U.S. equities.

The provided data shows a cumulative return of 76.18% for VOO, virtually identical to the benchmark S&P 500 index (76.18%).  The divergence is negligible (-0.0).  Therefore, VOO has closely tracked the S&P 500's performance over the measured period.

The alpha consistently shows as 0.0 across all periods, and the beta is 1.0 indicating perfect correlation with the S&P 500, hence minimal outperformance or underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 483.9

* **20-Day Moving Average:** 499.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 527.14

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent price change of 0.14 indicates a minor upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.38 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.09 (Positive, but close to zero, indicating weak momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-), indicating short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -0.0%  This indicates no expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  The lack of expected outperformance is consistent with the fund's tracking nature.

**Conclusion:**

VOO has closely mirrored the performance of the S&P 500, as expected. Current indicators suggest a moderately bearish short-term trend, but long-term expectations remain in line with the overall market performance. The small recent price increase does not indicate significant movement either way, given the context of the other technical indicators and the very small difference.  The lack of expected outperformance is not surprising for a fund which is designed to track the S&P 500 index.
