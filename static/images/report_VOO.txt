## Report: Analysis of Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO)

**1. Performance Overview & Comparison:**

VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) tracks the S&P 500 index, representing a broad market portfolio of 500 large-cap U.S. companies.

The provided data shows a cumulative return of 76.31% for VOO, virtually identical to the benchmark S&P 500's cumulative return of 76.31%.  The divergence is negligible (0.0%).  Therefore, VOO's performance has mirrored the S&P 500 extremely closely.

The Alpha consistently sits at 0.0, indicating that VOO's performance is precisely in line with the market (beta of 1.0). The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies across the years, reflecting market fluctuations, but the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) remains consistently low at 0%, highlighting the relatively stable nature of this index fund.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has steadily increased over time, reflecting the growth of the underlying companies.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $484.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $483.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $494.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $524.48

The closing price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor recent downward trend.  Both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages are significantly higher than the current price, indicating a potential short-term downward trend  from a longer-term perspective. The recent price increase from the previous close (+$2.52) signifies a minor positive day-to-day change, but it's not significant enough to classify as a sharp rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk) -  Suggests a moderate level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 40.97 –  Approaching oversold territory (below 30 generally indicates oversold conditions), suggesting potential for a short-term price increase, but not a definitive signal.
* **PPO:** 0.0556 –  A slightly positive value, indicating a mildly bullish momentum, but again, not strongly conclusive.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (-) -  Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  The provided data indicates no expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is expected given that VOO aims to track the index.

**Conclusion:**

VOO has demonstrated very close alignment with the S&P 500, as expected given its index-tracking nature.  Current indicators suggest a potentially short-term downward trend, with the RSI approaching oversold levels and the price trading below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages.  However, the overall outlook is neutral, aligning with the near-zero expected return compared to the S&P 500.  Long-term investors should consider VOO as a core holding for diversified exposure to the U.S. large-cap market.  Remember past performance is not indicative of future results.
