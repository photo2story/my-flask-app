**Analysis of Alpha, Beta Table:**

*   **Beta of 1:**  A beta of 1 indicates that VOO's price tends to move in line with the S&P 500 index.  This is consistent with its purpose as an S&P 500 tracking ETF.
*   **Alpha of 0:** An alpha of 0 suggests that VOO has not outperformed or underperformed the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis. This is also expected for a well-managed index tracking ETF.
*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR fluctuates, reflecting the overall performance of the S&P 500 during those periods. There's significant variation, from a low of -2% (2020-2022) to a high of 62% (2023-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during each period.  The MDD values are generally in the 10.5% to 18.8% range, indicating the potential for significant short-term losses.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):**  The market capitalization generally increases over time, reflecting the growth of the companies within the S&P 500.

*   **60-day SMA:** 622.0697

**Analysis:**

*   The current price (628.30) is slightly below the 5-day SMA (630.92), and the 20-day SMA (628.90).
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA. This *could* suggest a recent upward trend, but the proximity of the 5-day and 20-day SMAs indicates the trend is not very strong and could be reversing.
