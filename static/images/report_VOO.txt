**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 464.68
* **Last Market Data:** Price: 465.52, Previous Close: 494.16, Change: -5.8  (Significant drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 501.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 513.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 535.97

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The significant one-day drop of -5.8 indicates a potential short-term correction or sell-off.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4782 (High Risk)  This suggests elevated market risk.
* **RSI:** 23.31 (Oversold)  A very low RSI indicates the stock may be oversold and could potentially rebound.
* **PPO:** -0.65 (Bearish) A negative PPO value confirms the bearish sentiment.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) This shows a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0%  The expected return is not provided beyond the stated 0.0% and thus no long-term forecast against the S&P 500 can be produced beyond speculation. The provided data does not offer sufficient information to project long-term excess returns. More robust financial modeling is needed to make such a prediction.

**Conclusion:**

The provided data paints a picture of VOO currently experiencing a short-term downturn, possibly indicating a correction within a longer-term upward trend. The consistently high MDD across the years highlights the risk associated with holding the ETF. While the current price suggests potential oversold conditions and an imminent short term rebound,  a long-term investment decision requires additional factors beyond this short analysis, including your personal risk tolerance and broader market conditions.  The 0.0% excess return, based on available data, suggests that this ETF mirrors the market and currently doesn't present a significant outperformance opportunity at this time.
