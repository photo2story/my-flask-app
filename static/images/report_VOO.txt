## Report on VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)

**1. Performance Summary and Comparison:**

VOO, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, tracks the S&P 500 index, providing broad exposure to the U.S. large-cap equity market.

The provided data shows that both VOO and the benchmark S&P 500 have achieved a cumulative return of 89.44%.  The divergence between the two is 0.0, indicating they have performed identically over the measured period.

| Metric          | VOO                       | S&P 500                    | Difference |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| Cumulative Return | 89.44%                     | 89.44%                     | 0.0%        |
| Divergence (Max/Min/Current/Relative) | 0.0/0.0/0.0/0.0          | 0.0/0.0/0.0/0.0            | 0.0         |


The Alpha consistently shows a value of 0.0, indicating that the fund's performance has perfectly matched the benchmark's performance, generating no additional return beyond what is expected from the S&P 500. The Beta consistently shows a value of 1.0 which confirms the fund's close tracking of the benchmark.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values fluctuate year-over-year, reflecting the market's volatility.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) displays consistent growth over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last recorded market close, the VOO price stands at $519.625. While the closing price is higher than the previous close, the overall trend seems slightly bearish based on moving averages.


| Metric             | Value      |
|----------------------|------------|
| Closing Price       | $519.625   |
| 5-Day Moving Average | $516.85    |
| 20-Day Moving Average| $518.70    |
| 60-Day Moving Average| $538.47    |


The price is below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4403 (Medium Risk) suggests moderate risk associated with the current market condition.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 52.78 indicates a relatively neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.11 indicates a slightly bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0, suggests recent stability in the relative performance with a minor downward trend.

The recent price increase of $0.74 (0.74%)  shows a minor positive movement, however this is insufficient to indicate a rapid upward trend or market correction on it's own.  More data is needed to confirm this.

The expected return is listed as 0.0%. This is likely an indication that given the fund's goal of tracking the S&P 500, no additional return over the benchmark is projected. Over a longer time horizon (2+ years),  consistent investment in VOO is expected to yield a return comparable to the S&P 500 index, as its primary goal is replication.  Any deviation from this would be considered a deviation from its stated objective.
