**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 483.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 489.45
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 499.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 527.14

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.38 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.0871 (Slightly positive, indicating a potential bullish momentum, but weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -0.0% (The provided data does not show a significant deviation from the S&P 500, so the long-term expected excess return is expected to be minimal.)

The small price change of 0.14 from the previous close does not indicate a significant upward or downward movement.  The low RSI and negative divergence signals suggest caution, but the MRI value shows medium risk.  The negligible long-term outperformance over the S&P 500 is anticipated.


**Conclusion:**

VOO has historically tracked the S&P 500 very closely. While recent price action suggests a potential short-term bearish trend, the long-term outlook, given the historical data, suggests that VOO should continue to mirror the performance of the S&P 500, with minimal alpha.  Further analysis incorporating additional factors is needed before drawing definitive conclusions about future returns.
