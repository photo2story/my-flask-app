*   **Divergence (V vs. VOO):** -45.3%

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha, Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Visa Inc. is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and governments around the world.
*   **Performance:** Visa has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, with a divergence of -45.3%.

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta & related stats:**

The table presents a mixed picture of Visa's performance across different 3-year periods.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** CAGR has fluctuated significantly. From highs of 45% (2017-2019) to lows of -37% (2020-2022). More recent periods show a rebound.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** MDD remains consistently high across all periods, indicating significant volatility. Note that this is likely due to the 3-year rolling window, and large drawdown years impacting the whole window.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha shows a strong trend, decreasing dramatically over the periods analyzed. The periods of 2015-2019 show strong positive alpha, while the later periods are significantly negative. This suggests that Visa has become less able to generate excess returns compared to its benchmark (likely due to its increased beta during the period).
*   **Beta:** Beta has steadily increased, rising from 0.0 (2015-2017) to 1.1 (2021-2024), then dropping back down to 0.7 most recently. This indicates that Visa's price movements have become more correlated with the overall market. A beta of 1.1 suggests it was *slightly* more volatile than the market, and a beta of 0.7 suggests its now *less* volatile than the market.
*   **Cap (B):** Market capitalization has steadily increased, reflecting overall company growth despite performance fluctuations.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Visa has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly in recent years. The negative Alpha figures and the large divergence (-45.3%) from the S&P 500 demonstrate that. However, the price is currently in an upward trend and above all its Simple Moving Averages.

**Key Points and Considerations:**

*   **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** The substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern. While the company's market cap continues to grow, its returns haven't kept pace.
*   **Overbought Condition:** The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and due for a correction.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The very negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 is very concerning and needs to be investigated before buying.
*   **Mixed News:** The recent news is slightly positive, with mentions of a rally, dividend hikes, and stablecoin pushes, but it must be considered in the context of the company's long term performance.
*   **Analyst Consensus:** Analyst opinions are strongly positive, but analysts' target prices should be considered in the context of the other indicators.

**Recommendation:**

Due to negative expected return compared to S&P 500, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the overbought condition, **a cautious approach is recommended**. Given the negative expected return, further investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons for the negative forecast.
