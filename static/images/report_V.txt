**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $335.71
* **Last Market Price:** $347.6 (Slight increase from previous close of $342.45)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $330.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $332.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $341.49

The price is currently above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential for further upward movement to align with the longer-term trend. The last market price shows a minor upward move, but not significant enough to be considered a "sharp rebound."

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.26 (Approaching neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.27 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 4.5% (Long-term (2+ years) expected excess return over the S&P 500)

The combination of indicators suggests a relatively neutral outlook. While the PPO shows upward momentum, the RSI is near neutral and the relative divergence change suggests a minor short-term downward trend. The MRI places the stock at a medium level of risk.  The 4.5% long-term expected excess return is positive but needs to be considered within the overall market context and inherent investment risk.
