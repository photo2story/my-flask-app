    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates significantly.
    *   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk.
    *   **Alpha:**  The Alpha has been negative in recent periods (2018-2025), meaning Visa has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta has generally increased over time, approaching 1.1, suggesting Visa's price movements are becoming more correlated with the overall market but with increased volatility.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally increased over time, showing significant growth potential.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 331.57
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 331.61, Previous Close: 329.62, Change: 0.60
*   **5-day SMA:** 332.94
*   **20-day SMA:** 332.40
*   **60-day SMA:** 339.72

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) and further below the 60-day SMA. This might suggest a short-term downward trend or consolidation. The positive change from the previous close suggests a slight upward momentum, but it's crucial to consider this within the context of the longer-term trends indicated by the SMAs.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.44
*   **PPO:** 0.201
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90), Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.5 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1424.1

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The high MRI suggests that, based on this indicator alone, investment is recommended. However, this should be balanced with other indicators.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 40.44 suggests the stock is not yet oversold, but approaching it. There's room for further price decline before it might be considered undervalued based on this indicator alone.
    *   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.201 suggests the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, which could indicate a potential buy signal, but the value is still small.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is recommending buying.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms recent underperformance.
    *   **Expected Return:** The highly negative expected return is a major red flag. It suggests the model predicts significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. This may be an outlier.

Visa's recent performance has been concerning, significantly lagging the S&P 500. While analyst opinions are positive, the data suggests a mixed outlook:
*   **Underperformance:** Visa has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Negative Alpha:** The consistent negative Alpha indicates Visa is not generating sufficient risk-adjusted returns.
*   **Short-Term Downward Trend:**  The moving averages suggest a potential short-term downward trend.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Due Diligence:** Conduct further research to understand the reasons behind Visa's underperformance and the drivers behind the negative Alpha and potentially incorrect Expected Return.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Consider your risk tolerance. Visa appears to be experiencing increased volatility (higher Beta).
*   **Monitor News:**  Closely monitor news and analyst reports for any changes in sentiment or potential catalysts.
*   **Question the Expected Return Calculation:** This data point needs to be thoroughly investigated. Something seems wrong with the calculation or the underlying model. The expected return of -1424.1% is exceptionally unlikely and should be treated with extreme skepticism. It is highly recommended to review the data again, and if the data is correct, it is recommended to review the calculation process.

This analysis provides a starting point for making informed investment decisions regarding Visa. It's crucial to conduct further research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investments.
