* **Closing Price:** $330.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $325.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $317.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $310.81

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent price change of $0.61 (0.19%) indicates a minor upward movement.

* **PPO:** 0.4976 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and potentially due for a correction.  However, the positive PPO and relative divergence indicate continued upward momentum in the short term. The price increase is not significant enough to be classified as a sharp upward movement.  The expected return of 21.2% over the long term (2+ years) significantly exceeds the S&P 500,  reflecting the potential for alpha generation.
