Visa (V) has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showcasing strong alpha.  However, recent data reveals a slowdown, indicated by negative returns, lower CAGR in recent periods, negative PPO, a bearish RSI, and a price below major moving averages.  While the company shows strong earnings beats,  the high market risk indicator and relatively high MDD values in the historical data highlight the inherent volatility.  Long-term prospects remain positive given the consistent revenue, high profit margins, and high ROE, and the expected return exceeding the S&P 500.  However,  investors should carefully consider the current downward trend and higher risk level before investing.  Further analysis, including consideration of macroeconomic factors, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
