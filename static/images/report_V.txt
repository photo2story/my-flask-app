**7) Overall Summary:**

However, the extremely negative expected return needs clarification. Fundamentally, Visa remains a strong company with consistent revenue growth, high profit margins, and a solid ROE. The company is also actively pursuing new technologies and services, suggesting a commitment to future growth. Based on these observations, **prudence is advised.** It will be useful to investigate whether a market-wide variable influences the stock.
