**2. Recent Price Movement:**

Visa's current price is $321.59, below its 5-day ($318.94), 20-day ($335.40), and 60-day ($339.97) moving averages.  The last market day saw a price drop of $3.42 (from $332.43 to $321.06), indicating a recent downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 39.94 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, the negative PPO (-0.98) suggests bearish momentum.  The recent 20-day relative divergence change of -5.4% confirms a short-term downward trend.  The MRI of 0.4271 classifies the market risk as medium. The significant price drop of $3.42 points towards a period of moderate to significant downward pressure.  An 11.6% expected return over the long term versus the S&P 500 suggests a continued outperformance potential for long-term investors.
