*   **Beta:** Beta, which measures volatility relative to the market, has generally increased over time, suggesting Visa's price movements are becoming more correlated with and potentially more sensitive to overall market fluctuations.

*   **20-day SMA:** 332.6637
*   **60-day SMA:** 339.8959

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), and significantly below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a potential short-term downtrend.

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.5 (-): Short-term decline
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1424.1

*   The RSI of 44.57 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   PPO is also neutral.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, but this seems contradictory to the negative expected return.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days confirms the short-term decline.
*   The extremely negative expected return is very concerning and strongly suggests potential further underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This figure needs further investigation as it seems abnormally low.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Visa is currently presenting a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance vs. the S&P 500, negative Alpha in recent periods, high Maximum Drawdown, recent short-term downtrend (SMA analysis), negative change in recent relative divergence, and an alarmingly negative expected return.
*   **Positives:** Strong brand, analysts' "Buy" rating and target prices, positive news headlines suggesting undervaluation and a favorable regulatory environment, and high MRI score (though potentially misleading in this context).

**Conclusion:**

Despite positive analyst ratings and some positive news, the negative indicators (underperformance, negative Alpha, concerning expected return) raise significant concerns about investing in Visa at this time. The negative expected return, in particular, warrants further investigation to understand the underlying factors.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Investigate the negative expected return:** This is a critical piece of information that needs clarification. Understand the model and its assumptions that are generating this highly negative figure.
2.  **Consider the divergence:** Be aware that Visa has substantially underperformed the market.
3.  **Monitor SMA trends:** Watch for a break above the 60-day SMA as a potential sign of trend reversal.
4.  **Keep track of news and analyst ratings:** Pay attention to any changes in sentiment and target prices.
5.  **Factor in personal risk tolerance:** The high MDD indicates significant volatility, which may not be suitable for all investors.
