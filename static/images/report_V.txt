### 7. 종합 분석 (Overall Analysis)

**Summary:**

Visa (V) exhibits mixed signals. While the company shows strong revenue growth, high-profit margins, and consistent earnings beats, its recent stock performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest a short-term downward trend. The most concerning aspect is the extremely negative expected return of -136.1%, which, if accurate, would suggest significant underperformance compared to the market benchmark. However, analyst opinions remain largely positive.

**Considerations:**

*   **Underperformance:** The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 warrants further investigation.
*   **Technicals:** The negative technical indicators suggest caution in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The highly negative expected return is a major red flag.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** The positive analyst sentiment provides some counterweight to the negative signals.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data, a cautious approach to Visa (V) is warranted. While the company's financials are solid, the negative expected return and recent underperformance are significant concerns. Further research is needed to determine the underlying reasons for these issues before making an investment decision. The analyst consensus of "Buy" provides some reassurance, but the potential downside risk should not be ignored.
