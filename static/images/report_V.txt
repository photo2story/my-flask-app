The cumulative return difference between Visa and the S&P 500 on the last day of the data provided is 30.1%, placing it at the 49.8th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $318.31
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $314.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $302.26

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.

The conflicting signals from the RSI and PPO suggest caution.
