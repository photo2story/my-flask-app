| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 40.0%  | 67.1%  | 11.0%  | 0.0   | 221.3  |
| 2016-2018  | 25.0%  | 71.8%  | 9.0%   | 0.2   | 256.1  |

| 2020-2022  | -37.0% | 81.4%  | -37.0% | 1.0   | 403.2  |

| 2022-2024  | 16.0%  | 80.5%  | -5.0%  | 1.1   | 613.4  |
| 2023-2025  | 23.0%  | 80.4%  | -40.0% | 0.7   | 679.0  |

*   **Analysis:** The table shows a trend of decreasing alpha and increasing beta over the more recent periods. This suggests that Visa's performance has become more correlated with the market (higher beta) and less able to generate excess returns above the market (lower alpha). The MDD values are consistently high, indicating significant potential drawdowns.

**2) Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **Price Action:** The current price ($349.84) is above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term upward trend. The "Last-market" data indicates a positive change of 1.12, reflecting a recent upward price movement.

**3) Technical Indicators & Investment Signal:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):**  A high MRI of 0.9 suggests that the model considers Visa to be a relatively safe investment at this time.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 60.24 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), but is not there yet.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO of 0.33 suggests a bullish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)" indicates a strong buy signal based on the model, recommending full allocation to Visa.  It also suggests a small monthly investment.
*   **Relative Disparity Change:** The recent (20-day) change in relative disparity is +2.5, indicating a short-term upward trend in Visa's performance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Price Change Impact:** The positive price change of 1.12 is a small change, but it confirms the upward trend suggested by the moving averages.
*   **Expected Return:** A very negative expected return of -512.6% is a major red flag. This suggests the model anticipates significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite the current buy signal. This could be due to how the model weights the historical data or specific factors it's considering.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   Affirm partners with Ace Hardware: Could signal broader acceptance of digital payments and increased transaction volume for payment networks.
    *   Wall Street is bullish on Mastercard: While not directly about Visa, positive sentiment in the payments sector can be a tailwind.
    *   Checkout.com seeks Georgia banking charter: Indicates increasing competition in the payment processing space.
    *   Rothschild & Co Redburn Adjusts Price Target on Visa to $327: This is a negative signal as it lowers the target price. The neutral rating indicates they don't see a compelling reason to buy or sell.
    *   Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights PayPal, Robinhood Markets, Interactive Brokers and Visa: This could mean a positive sentiment around the stock

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a mean rating of 1.64. The average target price of $390.36 suggests a potential upside from the current price. However, the lowered price target from Rothschild is a counterpoint.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 예상 EPS |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-07-29 | 2.98 | 2.85     |
| 2025-04-29 | 2.76 | 2.68     |

| 2024-07-23 | 2.42 | 2.42     |

*   **Analysis:** Visa has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters. This indicates strong profitability and efficient management. However, the expected negative return of -512.6% raises serious concerns about the stock's future prospects, despite the positive EPS data. The high equity and consistently high ROE values further support the company's financial strength.

| 2024-06-30 | $39.73B   | 12.26% |

*   **Analysis:** Visa demonstrates strong financial performance with increasing revenue, consistently high-profit margins (around 80%), and a healthy Return on Equity (ROE). This suggests a financially stable and efficient company.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Visa presents a mixed picture. The company exhibits strong financials (high revenue, profit margins, and ROE) and has consistently beaten EPS expectations. Recent price action is positive, and analysts generally have a "Buy" rating with a target price offering upside. The MRI suggests the stock is considered relatively safe.

However, there are significant concerns. Visa has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the *expected return of -512.6%* is extremely alarming and overshadows many of the positive indicators. This is the most important point to investigate further. The trend of decreasing alpha and increasing beta also suggests Visa is becoming more like the market and less able to generate independent returns. The news of a lowered price target also needs to be taken into account.

**Conclusion:**

Despite the positive indicators, the very negative expected return is too significant to ignore. A deeper investigation into the model's calculation of this metric is warranted before making any investment decisions. If this number can be clarified (it could be an outlier or modeling error) then some investment in Visa could be considered, although it's worth bearing in mind the stock appears to be losing its edge against the S&P 500.
