## Visa Inc. (V) Stock Report

This report analyzes Visa Inc. (V), a leading global payments technology company, based on provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Visa's cumulative return (179.57%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (116.17%).  The difference is 63.4%, placing it at the 88.1st percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 (based on a range of -12.9% to 73.7%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over the years, indicating strong performance. Alpha values generally indicate outperformance relative to the market (Beta reflects market sensitivity). However, the significant negative CAGR in 2020-2022 highlights market sensitivity to broader economic factors.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth throughout the period.  High Beta values in some periods, especially 2017-2019 and 2021-2023 suggest that V's performance is highly correlated with the overall market during those times.
