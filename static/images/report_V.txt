**8) 종합 (Overall Summary)**

Visa Inc. exhibits a mixed picture. While recent earnings have consistently exceeded expectations, and revenue/profitability metrics remain strong, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term. The negative long-term expected return versus the S&P 500 is a significant concern.  However, the strong analyst consensus and recent positive news regarding stablecoin initiatives suggest potential for future growth.  The MRI indicates a high investment recommendation, but this should be balanced against the negative divergence and expected return.

**In Conclusion:** Visa is a fundamentally strong company, but its recent market performance warrants caution. The potential for future growth through digital payment innovations (like stablecoins) is a positive factor, but investors should carefully consider the underperformance relative to the broader market before investing.
