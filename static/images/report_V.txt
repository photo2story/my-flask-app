### 7. 종합적인 분석

Visa exhibits mixed signals:

*   **Positives:** Strong revenue growth, high profit margins, consistent earnings beats, and generally positive analyst sentiment.  Its involvement in new technologies like stablecoin infrastructure (Circle's Arc Testnet) is also encouraging.
*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, recent short-term downward price momentum, a very concerning negative expected return, and recent years of negative alpha.

**Recommendation:**

Given the strong financial fundamentals but concerning performance indicators (negative expected return and underperformance vs. S&P 500), a cautious approach is warranted. The positive Hybrid Signal might suggest a small initial investment, but closely monitor the company's performance relative to the market and investigate the reasons behind the negative expected return. Further due diligence is recommended before making any significant investment decisions.
