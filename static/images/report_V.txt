**Conclusion:**

The analysis paints a conflicting picture. The technical indicators show a potential for continued short-term gains, and analysts are generally optimistic. However, the underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the negative alpha, and the very negative expected return are major red flags. The news headlines further amplify the concerns about Visa's valuation and recent performance.

The hybrid signal says 90% Buy, but the expected return is very bad, implying that this indicator may need to be further revised for more accurate investment reference.

**Recommendation:**

While the analyst consensus and short-term technicals might tempt some investors, the significant underperformance, negative expected return, and concerning news suggest caution. Further research is warranted to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and whether Visa can regain its competitive edge and deliver returns in line with the broader market. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards before making any investment decisions. It would be prudent to understand why the "Expected Return" is so dramatically negative before investing.
