**Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows significant fluctuations, ranging from negative values (-37.0% to -15.0%) in the 2020-2023 periods to strong growth in earlier periods (up to 45.0% in 2017-2019). This volatility suggests that Visa's growth is highly dependent on market conditions.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, hovering around 70-80%. This indicates significant risk, as Visa experiences substantial declines from peak values during these periods.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are notably negative in recent years, indicating underperformance compared to the market. This suggests that Visa is not generating excess returns relative to the risk taken.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values have increased over time, peaking around 1.1. This suggests that Visa has become more sensitive to market movements, amplifying both gains and losses.
*   **Cap(B):** The Market Capitalization has generally increased, indicating overall growth in company size, although this growth doesn't necessarily translate to better performance metrics like Alpha.

### 2. Recent Price Action

**Key Numbers:**

*   Current Price: \$351.36
*   Previous Close: \$352.42
*   Change: -0.3 (-0.3%)
*   5-day Moving Average: \$349.77
*   20-day Moving Average: \$343.16
*   60-day Moving Average: \$345.16

**Analysis:**

The current price is slightly below the previous close, indicating a minor dip. The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend, although the 5-day MA is closest, indicating potential resistance.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

**Key Numbers:**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 65.52 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   PPO: 0.43
*   Hybrid Signal: Buy 100% (Very Safe)
*   Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change: +4.6 (Short-term increase)
*   Expected Return: -270.3% (Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 in the long term)

**Analysis:**

Despite the high MRI suggesting a favorable investment environment, the very negative expected return is concerning. RSI is approaching overbought, which could signal a potential pullback. The positive change in relative divergence suggests recent short-term outperformance, but this contradicts the overall underperformance trend.

The price change of -0.3 isn't significant enough to warrant specific " 급반등, 급하락" commentary.

### 7. 종합 Analysis

Visa Inc. presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Aspects:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, both historically and in expected future returns.
    *   High Maximum Drawdown indicates significant risk.
    *   Negative Alpha suggests underperformance relative to risk taken.
    *   RSI approaching overbought territory.
*   **Positive Aspects:**
    *   Strong and increasing revenue and profit margins.
    *   Consistent EPS beats analyst expectations.
    *   Analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus with a target price significantly above the current price.
    *   Active involvement in emerging payment technologies (stablecoins, digital wallets).
    *   High Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a favorable investment environment, but this seems contradictory given the other negative indicators.
*   **Important Consideration:**
    *   The very negative expected return (-270.3%) needs careful consideration. If this is accurate, it suggests that despite the company's strong fundamentals, it may face significant headwinds or be overvalued currently.

**Conclusion:**

While Visa demonstrates strong fundamental financial performance and is adapting to changes in the payment landscape, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the highly negative expected return are major concerns. An investor should carefully weigh these factors against the positive analyst sentiment and recent EPS beats before making an investment decision.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative expected return is warranted.
