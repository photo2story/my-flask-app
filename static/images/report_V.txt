**6) Overall Analysis:**

Visa (V) demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, consistently outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows a short-term dip, the long-term fundamentals remain strong, supported by consistently positive EPS surprises, high profit margins, and a relatively low beta.  The high expected return suggests significant upside potential for long-term investors. However, the recent negative price change and the negative PPO warrant caution. Further investigation into the cause of the recent price drop is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The relatively stable performance history suggests that Visa is a relatively low-risk investment, but no investment is without risk. The substantial long-term growth potential should be weighed against the inherent market risks.
