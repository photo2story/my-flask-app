2025-12-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Visa (V) stock data you provided, along with analysis.

**1. Return Rate Comparison (Visa vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   Visa Cumulative Return: 55.59%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 100.88%
    *   Divergence (Visa - VOO): -45.29%
    *   Relative Divergence: 13.0 (Visa's current divergence is in the bottom 13% of its historical range relative to VOO)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Company Overview:** Visa Inc. is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks, and governments worldwide, enabling electronic payments among them.
    *   Visa has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period being measured (ending with a difference of -45.29% ).
    *   The Relative Divergence of 13.0 suggests that Visa's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is currently near the lower end of its historical range. It is important to note that this *does not* mean Visa is guaranteed to rebound, but rather that its recent underperformance is significant compared to its history.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table**

*   **Simple Numbers:** The table shows various metrics for rolling 3-year periods from 2015-2025.
    *   **CAGR:**  Ranges from -37% to 45%
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, ranging from ~67% to ~81%.
    *   **Alpha:**  Ranges from -43% to 23%.  Generally negative in more recent periods.
    *   **Beta:**  Increasing trend, rising from 0 in 2015-2017 to 1.1 in 2021-2024, then declining to 0.7 in 2023-2025.
    *   **Cap(B) (Market Cap in Billions):** Growing Significantly

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Risk vs. Return:** The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures indicate a relatively high level of risk associated with Visa, even though the market cap continued to rise.
    *   **Alpha Decline:** The declining Alpha, especially in recent periods, suggests that Visa is underperforming relative to its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500, or a similar index) *after* accounting for market risk (Beta).  This reinforces the return rate comparison.
    *   **Beta Increase:** The increasing Beta means that Visa's price movements have become more correlated with the overall market, but has declined again in the last period.

*   **Analysis:**

    *   RSI: 72.73 (Overbought)
    *   PPO: 0.64
    *   Relative Divergence Change (20 days): +0.5 (Positive, Short-term increase)
    *   Expected Return: -92.8%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI Suggests Caution:** Market Risk Indicator suggests a "Medium" level of investment.
    *   **Overbought RSI:**  An RSI of 72.73 indicates that Visa is currently overbought and may be due for a pullback.
    *   **PPO:** the PPO is above 0, which indicates a positive trend on the average.
    *   **Short-Term Divergence Improvement:** Recent increase in divergence (Relative Divergence Change) suggests a short-term rally, which is congruent with the current price being above the SMA's.
    *   **Very Negative Expected Return:** The expected return of -92.8% compared to the S&P 500 is extremely negative and should be viewed with significant skepticism. This seems like an error, especially in light of the market risk indicator of .8.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Overall Assessment:**  Visa appears to be a company with strong long-term potential, however it is currently underperforming the S&P 500.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The technical indicators (RSI, SMA relationships) give mixed signals. The recent short-term momentum is positive, but the RSI suggests it's overbought and may be due for a pullback.

*   **Key Considerations:**

    *   **Underperformance Relative to S&P 500:** This is a major concern. Investors need to understand why Visa is lagging and whether the company is taking steps to address this. Is it competition, market conditions, or company-specific issues?
    *   **Analyst Sentiment:** The positive analyst ratings are encouraging, but should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.
    *   **Market Volatility:** Broader market conditions could impact Visa's performance. The news article about FOMO vs. Bubble Angst is a reminder of the uncertainty in the market.
    *   **"Expected Return" Error:** The negative expected return figure seems highly improbable and should be verified.
