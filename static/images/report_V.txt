Visa's cumulative return (142.86%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.40%) over the measured period. The difference is 22.5%, placing it in the 40.8th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (max: 73.8%, min: -12.8%).

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.
