**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of materials engineering solutions used in the semiconductor industry.  The cumulative return of AMAT is 272.96%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 116.71%. The difference is 156.25%, placing it at the 43.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates strong outperformance, but within the range of its historical volatility against the S&P 500.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $163.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $166.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $172.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $183.20

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 21.40 (Significantly below 30, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.38 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -2.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 502.4% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 projected over the long term)

The low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the recent price decline, suggest bearish sentiment. However, the high projected long-term return indicates potential for significant upside. The current price of $163.59, being below the moving averages, doesn't suggest a sudden, drastic rebound or drop, but rather a continuation of the short-term downtrend.

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Therefore, no information can be included regarding market outlook or analyst performance highlights.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, showing a strong historical track record.  However, recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, supported by technical indicators suggesting oversold conditions. While the long-term outlook remains positive based on the projected return, the near-term picture is less certain.  The recent earnings show some volatility but generally stable revenue and high profit margins. More context, particularly recent news and analyst sentiment, would be needed for a more comprehensive assessment. The lack of recent news and the duplication in the earnings data limits the depth of analysis possible.
