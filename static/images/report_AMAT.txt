AMAT has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, particularly in the 2019-2021 period. However, recent performance has weakened, with declining EPS and ROE. The current price is below key moving averages, suggesting bearish momentum. While long-term projections are positive, considerable caution is advised due to the inherent uncertainties in such projections and the recent weakening in performance indicators.  Further investigation is needed to verify the accuracy of the data (especially concerning duplicate earnings data) and to better understand the assumptions behind the high long-term expected return.  The risk profile of AMAT needs to be carefully considered in relation to investor risk tolerance.
