*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  The consistently high MDD values suggest AMAT can be volatile.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the performance of AMAT relative to its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500, although this isn't explicitly stated in the Alpha Beta anlaysis | Year | CAGR | MDD | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | table). Positive alpha indicates outperformance, while negative alpha indicates underperformance. The positive Alpha in 2015-2017 and 2023-2025 aligns with the high CAGR during those times. Large negative alpha values correspond with the periods of negative CAGR and are most likely due to negative comparison with the S&P500.
