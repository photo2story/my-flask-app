**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries for 2025-02-20.

A more detailed analysis would require additional data and clarification on the conflicting entries.

|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-02-20 | 1.46 | $7.17B      |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has historically shown strong performance compared to the S&P 500, with periods of significant outperformance.  However, recent performance (2022-2025) has been weak, showing negative CAGR and declining EPS. While the recent price is above short-term moving averages, RSI suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to correction.  The high projected long-term return should be viewed with caution. A thorough analysis requires addressing the inconsistent earnings data and considering macroeconomic factors influencing the semiconductor industry.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the projected long-term return is warranted before making any investment decisions.
