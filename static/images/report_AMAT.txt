Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and EPS decline is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high predicted return should be viewed with caution given the current negative trends.  Thorough due diligence, considering macroeconomic factors, and industry-specific analyses are recommended before any investment decision.
