## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of manufacturing equipment for the semiconductor industry.  The cumulative return for AMAT is 322.88%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%. The difference is 194.0%, placing it at the 49.1st percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.


The alpha/beta analysis reveals consistently high alpha values (above 2.0) across all periods, indicating significant outperformance compared to the market benchmark.  Beta values fluctuate, reflecting varying sensitivity to market movements, but generally suggest a higher-than-average risk.  Note that the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) also shows strong growth over these periods.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) is notable, highlighting the risk associated with this stock, particularly in 2016-2018 and 2020-2022. Market capitalization also grew substantially over the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $171.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $173.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $179.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $187.58

The stock is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (25.79):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is due.
* **PPO (-0.25):** Negative value signals a bearish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-9.4%):** Shows a recent decline in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.

The current price of $171.32 is below the moving averages, aligning with the negative PPO and relative divergence, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The expected return of 487.9% over the long term (2+ years) represents a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, if the long-term growth projection is accurate. However, consider the high risk inherent in the high MDD.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, evidenced by a significantly higher cumulative return and consistently positive alpha. However, the high beta and substantial maximum drawdowns indicate significant risk. Recent price action shows a bearish trend, supported by technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages).  Earnings have shown some recent volatility in EPS, while revenues are stable.  Long-term projections suggest significant outperformance, but caution is warranted given the volatility demonstrated by the high MDD. More information is required on recent news and analyst sentiment to complete the analysis.


**8. Recommendations:**

A more complete analysis requires the missing information (recent news, analyst opinions, and comparison to earnings expectations).  Based on available data, AMAT presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.  Investors with a long-term horizon and a tolerance for substantial volatility may consider AMAT, while those seeking lower risk should carefully consider the historical MDD and recent downward trend.  Further research incorporating the missing data is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.
