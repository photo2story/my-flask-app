## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), a leading provider of materials engineering solutions for the semiconductor industry, shows a significantly higher cumulative return than the S&P 500 (VOO) over an unspecified period.  However, recent performance indicates potential weakness, warranting further investigation into underlying factors.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Applied Materials (AMAT) shows a cumulative return of 112.22%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 78.93%.  The current divergence is 33.3%, representing a position in the 20.5th percentile of the historical range (max: 256.9%, min: -24.2%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals varying performance across different time periods.  While periods like 2019-2021 show exceptionally high CAGR (279%) and Alpha (219%), recent years (2022-2025) indicate negative CAGRs, suggesting market volatility impacts AMAT more significantly than the broader market (high Beta values).  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over time, indicating company growth.  The high Beta consistently suggests significant market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $143.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $138.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $141.11
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $157.28

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent price increase of $3.82 (from $138.30) might indicate a temporary rebound or a potential short-term reversal of the downward trend.  Further observation is needed to confirm this.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 47.65 (slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.55 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but it's not exceptionally high)
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** -1.1 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 426.6% (over 2 years vs. S&P 500) - This exceptionally high expected return requires further investigation and context.  The basis for this projection is unclear and needs justification.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2025-02-20 | 1.46    | $7.17B       |
| 2024-08-22 | 2.06    | $6.78B       |

There appears to be an error in the data; the 2025-02-20 entry is duplicated.  Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains around $6.7B-$7.2B. EPS has decreased significantly in the most recent quarter (2025-02-20), indicating a potential concern. Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind this decline.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showcasing periods of strong growth and high alpha.  However, recent performance indicators, including negative CAGR, declining EPS, and price movement below moving averages, suggest a potential weakening trend. The high Beta highlights its sensitivity to market fluctuations. While the high expected return is intriguing, it needs further explanation and justification.  Before making any investment decision, a thorough investigation into the reasons behind the recent earnings decline and the basis for the high projected return is crucial.  The medium risk MRI rating also supports further caution.
