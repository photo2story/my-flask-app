This report analyzes Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), a leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMAT's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference in cumulative returns is 286.09% - 120.91% = **165.28%**.  The relative divergence of 45.8% indicates that AMAT's performance has been considerably stronger than the S&P 500 over the measured period, placing it in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the benchmark.  The provided data indicates substantial outperformance over various time periods, with a high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), although it should be noted that past performance is not indicative of future results.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $169.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $169.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $173.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $185.82

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (42.7):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 30), indicating potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.16):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-1.8):** Shows a recent short-term weakening in the stock's relative strength.
* **Expected Return (478.8%):** This extremely high figure needs further context.  Is this a projection based on a specific model?  Its plausibility should be carefully evaluated given the potential for significant risk and volatility in the market.

Given the current price of $169.35, which is relatively lower than the moving averages, and the technical indicators, it doesn't suggest a significant recent upward or downward surge.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **EPS:** Fluctuated between $1.86 and $2.43 over the last four quarters.  The most recent quarter (2024-08-22) shows a slight decrease in EPS compared to the previous quarter.

* **Revenue:** Relatively stable around $6.6-6.8B, with minor fluctuations.  No clear upward or downward trend is strongly apparent from this limited data set.

The data alone doesn't reveal whether these results beat or missed expectations without access to those expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:**  Relatively consistent over the past year, with some minor fluctuations.
* **Profit Margin:**  Maintains a strong and fairly consistent level around 47%, showing robust profitability.
* **Equity:**  Steady increase over time, indicating positive growth in shareholder equity.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** Shows fluctuations, possibly linked to changes in net income or equity levels.  There was a notable dip in ROE in the most recent quarter.  This requires further investigation to understand underlying factors.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent price action and some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downtrend.  Earnings show some volatility in EPS, but revenue remains relatively stable and profitability is high.   Further investigation is required to fully understand the recent performance dip relative to earlier highs. Key information missing from the analysis includes analyst expectations (for comparison to reported earnings), recent news impacting the stock, and a thorough explanation of the unusually high projected long-term return (478.8%). This report can only provide a limited analysis due to the insufficient data provided.  Accessing and including relevant news articles, analyst reports, and a more detailed breakdown of the expected return calculation is crucial for a complete and accurate assessment of AMAT's current investment prospects.
