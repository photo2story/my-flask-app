## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of manufacturing equipment for the semiconductor industry.

The cumulative return of AMAT is 287.19%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.47%.  The difference is 174.72%.  The relative divergence of 48.2% indicates that AMAT's performance is currently in the upper half of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to remember that this relative divergence is based on past data and doesn't guarantee future performance.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant variability in performance across different periods, highlighting the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. While some periods show extremely high growth, others show negative returns.  The high beta values (generally above 1) suggest AMAT is more volatile than the overall market.  The relatively consistent alpha of around 0.1 indicates a slightly positive outperformance compared to the market benchmark.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $168.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $176.28

The price is currently below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  However, it's above the 20-day moving average, indicating some short-term support.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 63.53 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 0.74 (Positive value indicates upward momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.4 (Indicates short-term upward momentum.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 175.4% (This represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, but this projection should be viewed with caution as it's based on historical data and market conditions can change significantly.)  The current price of $170.86 is not exceptionally high or low considering the other indicators and is not indicative of a sharp upward or downward movement.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, its performance is cyclical and highly volatile.  The current price suggests a potential short-term downtrend, but positive technical indicators and a strong long-term expected return (with the caveat that this is just a projection) might make it attractive for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is recommended.  The consistent high profit margins and increasing equity are positive signs. However, investors should carefully consider the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential for significant price fluctuations before making any investment decisions.
