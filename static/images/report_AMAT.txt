## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.  The cumulative return of AMAT (272.96%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (116.71%). The difference is 156.25%.  The relative outperformance of 43.7% indicates that AMAT's performance is in the higher percentile range compared to the S&P 500's performance over the observed period.  Note that the relative outperformance is based on the historical range of outperformance, not a measure of future potential.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility in AMAT's performance, reflected in varying CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different periods.  While Alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, indicating some degree of outperformance, the Beta fluctuates significantly, suggesting high sensitivity to market movements.  This sensitivity is especially apparent in the 2019-2021 period where both CAGR and MDD are exceptionally high, implying a large market impact. Capitalization (Cap(B)) also demonstrates consistent growth over the years.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 112.0% | 8.5% | 83.0% | 0.1 | 38.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 163.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 166.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 172.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 183.20

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (21.39):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound, but also vulnerability to further decline.
* **PPO (-0.38):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-2.1):**  Confirms a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (502.4%):** This exceptionally high expected return, likely over a long time horizon (2+ years), should be treated cautiously.  While the historical outperformance is strong,  projecting this far into the future carries substantial risk.  The 502.4% figure may reflect exceptionally high growth periods and doesn't represent a guaranteed outcome.  Consider this as a very high-risk, high-reward possibility.  A 163.59 price does not warrant mention of a rapid upswing or downswing, as the context for a sharp price movement is missing.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high growth potential but also significant volatility.  Recent price action indicates a short-term bearish trend, supported by negative PPO and low RSI.  Earnings show some instability, and without further context (analyst expectations, macroeconomic factors), it's difficult to fully interpret. The projected long-term return is extremely high and should be viewed with caution due to inherent market risks. Further information on recent news and analyst sentiment is needed for a more complete assessment.
