Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.  The cumulative return of AMAT is 294.46%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.19%. The difference is 172.27%, placing it at the 47.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates strong outperformance, although the relative percentile suggests periods of underperformance have also occurred.

However, Beta values also fluctuate significantly (between 25 and 143), demonstrating that the stock's price is highly sensitive to market movements. The high beta values in recent years suggest heightened market volatility impact.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the longer term.  However, the recent price action shows a short-term downward trend, below key moving averages. While the positive PPO suggests some bullish momentum, the negative relative divergence and lower EPS in the most recent quarter give cause for caution.  The financial information indicates a generally healthy financial position with high profitability.  The substantial expected return should be considered with significant skepticism due to its magnitude and inherent reliance on assumptions.  More recent news and analyst opinions are needed for a complete assessment. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry needs to be factored into any long-term investment decision.
