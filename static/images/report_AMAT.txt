## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and services.  The cumulative return of AMAT is 330.85%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.31%. The difference is 202.5%, placing it at the 51st percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (ranging from -28.9% to 424.9%).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistently high Alpha values (1.9 to 4.0), suggesting AMAT has significantly outperformed the market, though Beta values also indicate high volatility and market sensitivity.  Market capitalization has increased substantially over the period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $174.55 (Last Market: $172.01)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $172.84
* **20-day Moving Average:** $181.18
* **60-day Moving Average:** $187.92

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short term.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price suggests relatively stable trading on the day of the last closing price.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (38.61):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce.
* **PPO (-0.35):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Strength Divergence (-7.4%):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength against the benchmark.

The combination of a low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the negative relative strength divergence, points to a bearish short-term outlook. However, the RSI nearing oversold levels might signal a potential short-term reversal.  The fact that the last market price ($172.01) is not significantly different from the closing price suggests that no significant event leading to a sharp rebound or drop happened between closing and last market price.

The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return is 469.1% relative to the S&P 500, but this high figure must be considered alongside the high volatility implied in the Beta values.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue, with a slight downward trend in recent quarters. The most recent EPS of $2.06 and revenue of $6.78B are slightly lower than the previous quarter.  A comparison to analyst expectations for the most recent quarter is needed to determine whether these figures met, exceeded, or fell short of expectations.  This would significantly influence the market outlook.


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals consistent high profit margins (around 47%) and positive ROE (though fluctuating), demonstrating profitability and strong return on equity.  However, a deeper dive into the balance sheet and cash flow statements would provide a more comprehensive picture of the company's financial health.  The slight downward trend in some key metrics warrants further analysis.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires accessing real-time news sources such as Shacknews and Finbold to provide relevant information on earnings announcements, analyst opinions, and market outlook within the last two days.  Please provide that news for a complete analysis.)*

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, presenting a strong long-term growth story.  However, the recent short-term trend is bearish, indicated by the moving averages, PPO, and relative strength divergence.  The approaching oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the sustainability of this is uncertain. The recent earnings figures require comparison to analyst expectations to gauge their impact on the market.  Long-term investors might find the potential for significant outperformance attractive, but the high volatility and market sensitivity must be considered. The news and analyst opinions will be crucial in forming a final opinion.

**8. Recommendation:**

*(A concrete recommendation – buy, hold, or sell – cannot be given without the missing information from section 7. The analysis highlights both the long-term potential and the short-term risks, necessitating further research before making an investment decision.)*  A thorough review of the most recent earnings reports against analyst expectations, as well as recent news and analyst sentiment, is crucial for a comprehensive assessment. The high volatility and historical outperformance present both significant upside and downside risk.
