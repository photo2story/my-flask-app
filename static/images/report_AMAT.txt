## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Review

This report analyzes Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), a leading supplier of materials and equipment used in the semiconductor industry.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AMAT's cumulative return (308.69%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (119.91%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 188.8%, placing it at the 51.6th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (maximum difference: 388.7%, minimum: -24.2%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility in returns and substantial variation in Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and Beta (market sensitivity) across different periods.  The high Alpha values in some years (e.g., 2017-2019, 2019-2021) suggest periods of significant outperformance, while negative CAGR in 2022-2024 shows considerable market risk.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) also increased substantially over time, reflecting the company's growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $180.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $176.95
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $179.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $176.05

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum, but below the longer-term 60-day average indicating a potential trend reversal.  The recent price change (-$0.75) shows a minor daily decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.46 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.34 (Slightly bearish; indicating weakening momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 156.8% (significantly exceeding S&P 500 over 2+ years)


The negative change in price and the slightly bearish PPO, combined with the negative relative divergence, point towards a short-term bearish trend.  However, the high expected return suggests a potentially strong long-term outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and relatively stable revenue.  EPS dipped in the most recent quarter (Q4 2024).  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations (e.g., seasonality, market conditions).

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-08-22 | 2.06 | $6.78 B     |

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data indicates consistent and relatively high revenue and profit margins. Equity has shown steady growth, although ROE has fluctuated, showing a higher value in earlier quarters. This indicates a healthy financial position, though the slight decrease in ROE could be a point for monitoring.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $7.04B | 47.34% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. While recent price action suggests some short-term weakness, the company exhibits healthy financial fundamentals with consistently high revenue and profit margins.  The high projected long-term return suggests potential for substantial gains, but the historical volatility and market sensitivity (Beta) should be considered.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent EPS decline and the variation in Alpha and Beta across different periods is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for long-term growth against the inherent risks associated with this volatile stock.
