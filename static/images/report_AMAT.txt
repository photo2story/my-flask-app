* **20-Day Moving Average:** $172.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $176.34

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day averages indicates a recent acceleration in the upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (76.92):**  The Relative Strength Index is in overbought territory (generally above 70), suggesting the stock might be due for a short-term correction.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+10.1):** Shows a recent increase in relative strength, confirming the upward trend.
* **Expected Return (125%):**  This implies a significant expected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500. This should be viewed with caution as projected returns are not guarantees. The recent price change of $0.43, while positive, is not a significant jump, and doesn't necessarily signal a rapid upward trend.
