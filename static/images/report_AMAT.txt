* **Ticker:** AMAT
* **Company:** Applied Materials Inc. (a leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment)
* **Cumulative Return (AMAT):** 209.76%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 91.19%

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AMAT significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return more than double that of the benchmark.  The provided alpha and beta values show varying market sensitivity (beta) and excess return (alpha) across different periods. While beta fluctuates, suggesting changing market sensitivity, alpha generally indicates positive outperformance relative to the market, particularly in recent years.  High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values further support this observation.  However, the most recent period shows a negative CAGR, highlighting the volatility inherent in the semiconductor sector.

* **Last Market Price:** $143.81 (down $0.87 from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $151.81
* **20-day Moving Average:** $152.71
* **60-day Moving Average:** $168.53

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent negative change (-0.87) indicates a slight decrease.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.84 (Below 50, indicating bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.27 (Positive, but relatively low)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.7% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 323.4% (Long-term expectation significantly exceeding the S&P 500)

The indicators suggest a mixed picture. While the expected return is highly positive, the RSI and recent price movement indicate bearish momentum in the short term.  The relatively small price drop (-0.87) does not suggest a dramatic market event.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 2024-02-27 | 2.43  | $6.71B      |
| 2025-02-20 | 2.43  | $6.71B      |

There's a discrepancy in the data, showing two entries for 2025-02-20.  Excluding the duplicate, revenue has shown relatively consistent performance, though EPS has declined in recent quarters.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31  | $7.17B    | 48.79%        |
| 2024-10-31  | $7.04B    | 47.34%        |
| 2024-07-31  | $6.78B    | 47.29%        |
| 2024-04-30  | $6.65B    | 47.44%        |
| 2024-01-31  | $6.71B    | 47.77%        |

Revenue shows a slight upward trend, and profit margins remain relatively stable and healthy.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE       |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 2025-01-31  | $18.62B    | 6.36%     |
| 2024-10-31  | $19.00B    | 9.11%     |
| 2024-07-31  | $18.84B    | 9.05%     |
| 2024-04-30  | $18.20B    | 9.46%     |
| 2024-01-31  | $17.43B    | 11.58%    |

Equity has increased, but ROE (Return on Equity) has declined recently.  This could warrant further investigation.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

AMAT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong long-term growth potential.  However, recent short-term indicators suggest a possible bearish trend.  The high projected long-term return is enticing, but potential investors should carefully consider the current market conditions and the recent decline in EPS and ROE before making investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the declining EPS and the data discrepancy is recommended.  The long-term prospects remain positive based on the historical performance and market position, but short-term volatility needs to be managed.
