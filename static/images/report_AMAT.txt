## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Report

**0. Overview:**

Applied Materials Inc. is a leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and services.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMAT's cumulative return (104.26%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (76.08%).  The difference is 28.18 percentage points.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different periods.  While some periods show strong alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others show negative CAGR.  This highlights the volatility of AMAT and the influence of market conditions on its performance. The significant variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates significant volatility in returns over time.  Note that a high beta (above 1) suggests higher volatility compared to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $138.19
* **5-day Moving Average:** $142.27
* **20-day Moving Average:** $144.12
* **60-day Moving Average:** $160.46

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential bearish trend.  The recent price change (-4.99) shows a significant daily drop.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.31 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.59 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but needs further context)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.0 (Short-term bearish signal)

The combination of a relatively low RSI and a recent price drop suggests potential for further decline in the short term.  The positive PPO indicates potential upward momentum. However, given the negative recent price change, a short-term downward correction might still be possible.  The MRI suggests a moderate risk profile. The 484.8% expected return is high and needs further justification.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue. While there's a slight upward trend in revenue over the observed period, EPS shows some decline in recent quarters.  The duplicate entry for 2025-02-20 needs clarification.


| 날짜       | EPS | 매출       |
|------------|-----|------------|
| 2025-02-20 | 1.46 | $7.17 B    |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term. However, recent price action indicates a potential short-term bearish trend. The company's financial health appears relatively strong, but profitability metrics have shown some fluctuation.  The high projected long-term return should be viewed cautiously, given the volatility demonstrated in the historical data and the need for more detail in its calculation methodology.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price decline and a more detailed analysis of the provided data are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistencies within the provided data (duplicate earnings data, lack of context for the high expected return) need clarification.
