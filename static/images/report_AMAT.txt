* **20-Day Moving Average:** $176.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $176.70

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it sits above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential support levels.  The recent price drop of $2.07 (from $190.70) is notable but doesn't constitute a significant crash.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 185.1% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is anticipated over the long term.)

The high RSI suggests potential overbought conditions, which could lead to a short-term correction. However, the positive PPO and high expected return suggest a longer-term bullish outlook. The recent price drop is consistent with the short-term bearish signal from the relative divergence.
