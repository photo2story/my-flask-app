**6. Overall Conclusion:**

AMAT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance has been weaker, indicated by negative CAGRs and declining EPS. While the high expected return and some positive technical indicators suggest long-term potential, the recent downward trend requires careful consideration.  The company's strong profit margins and generally increasing revenue are positive signs.  However, further investigation into the reasons behind the declining EPS and ROE, as well as the clarification of the duplicate earnings data, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high projected long-term return should be considered alongside the medium-level market risk and recent underperformance.
