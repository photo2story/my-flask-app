## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

AMAT, Applied Materials Inc., is a leading supplier of equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.  The following analysis summarizes provided data.


**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **AMAT Cumulative Return:** 253.57%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 112.87%
* **Return Difference:** 140.7% (AMAT outperformed VOO significantly)
* **Relative Percentile (based on historical range):** 39.9%  This indicates that the current outperformance is relatively high compared to the historical range of outperformance, but not at its extreme.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows that AMAT has consistently displayed a positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) over several periods, ranging from 0.1 to 1.2.  Beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity.  The significantly higher CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for AMAT compared to implied VOO returns indicates substantial outperformance.  Note that the high beta values (particularly in some periods) suggest higher risk.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in some periods also highlights significant potential losses. The market capitalization (Cap) increased significantly over the years.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $156.64
* **Previous Close:** $168.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $166.25
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $175.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $174.45

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent significant drop (-$7.04) shows a recent downward movement.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 28.59  (Indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential for a rebound)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.21 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.4% (Short-term downward trend)

The low RSI suggests the stock may be oversold and due for a bounce, but the negative PPO and recent price action indicate bearish momentum. The significant price drop from the previous close should be considered a substantial short-term negative event.


**Expected Return:** 244.4%  This represents a significant projected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming consistent historical trends continue.  This projection must be treated with caution as it is based on past performance, which is not indicative of future results.



**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-02-20 | $1.46  | $7.17 B       |
| 2024-08-22 | $2.06  | $6.78 B       |

| 2024-02-27 | $2.43  | $6.71 B       |
| 2025-02-20 | $1.46 | $7.17 B |

There is a discrepancy in the data for 2025-02-20, with two entries and varying EPS figures.  This requires clarification.  Overall, revenue appears relatively stable, while EPS shows some volatility.  A more detailed analysis would require understanding the business's seasonal trends and the reasons for the fluctuations in EPS.

**6) Overall Summary:**

AMAT has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong CAGR and positive alpha. However,  the recent price drop, coupled with bearish technical indicators (PPO), suggests a short-term negative trend. The relatively low RSI suggests potential for a bounce.  Long-term prospects appear positive,  indicated by high profit margins and relatively stable revenue growth.  However,  the high beta and past MDD values reveal considerable risk.  Inconsistencies in the earnings data and variations in ROE require further investigation.  Before investing,  a thorough due diligence should be conducted considering both the potential for significant returns and the inherent volatility of the stock.  The long-term projection should be viewed with significant caution.
