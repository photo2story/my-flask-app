*   **60-day SMA:** 235.9113

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently above its 5-day and 60-day SMA, but below its 20-day SMA. The recent positive change and the 5-day SMA being below the 20-day SMA *might* indicate a potential slowing of upward momentum or a short-term pullback. However, the current price being significantly above the 60-day SMA suggests a stronger, longer-term upward trend.

*   **Expected Return:** 11.5% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment risk. The RSI is neutral, providing no strong buy or sell signal. The negative PPO and recent divergence change suggest some short-term downward pressure. However, the "Buy" hybrid signal and high expected return (11.5% over 2 years) present a bullish long-term outlook.
