There's a discrepancy in the data:  The February 2025 data appears duplicated from February 2024. This needs clarification.  However, the available data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  A declining EPS trend is apparent from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024, followed by a potential sharp drop in Q1 2025 (requiring clarification due to the data duplication.) Revenue remains relatively stable. Further analysis is required with accurate data.
