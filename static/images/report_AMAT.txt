**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|

There's a noticeable decline in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024. Revenue shows some fluctuations but no clear trend.  The repeated entry for 2024-02-27 suggests a data entry error.  Further investigation is needed to accurately assess the earnings trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 in the past, but recent performance (particularly in the last 2 years) indicates substantial volatility and a decline in certain key metrics. The high Market Risk Indicator suggests caution. While the long-term expected return is high, it's crucial to consider the risks associated with the high volatility and potentially inaccurate or incomplete data provided.   A more thorough analysis, including examination of industry trends, competitor analysis, and further validation of the provided financial data, is needed before forming a conclusive investment opinion.  The conflicting signals from different indicators (positive relative strength, negative PPO, high MRI) suggest a period of uncertainty for AMAT.
