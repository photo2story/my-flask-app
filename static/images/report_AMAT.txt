*   **Relative Spread Change:** The negative change in relative spread reinforces the recent downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:**  The very high expected return (156.7% over S&P 500) should be treated with caution. It represents a long-term projection based on historical data and may not be indicative of future performance. It is a positive signal for long-term investors, but needs careful consideration.
