## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Report

**0. Overview:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMAT's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **AMAT Cumulative Return:** 203.98%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** 114.54%  (This represents a substantial outperformance.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 34.2% (This indicates AMAT's performance is in the higher percentile range compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.)


The provided alpha and beta analysis shows varying performance relative to the market (beta) and excess return (alpha) over different periods.  While recent periods show high alpha, the most recent year exhibits negative performance (-67% CAGR).  This highlights the volatility inherent in the semiconductor sector and AMAT's susceptibility to market cycles.  High beta values also indicate a higher sensitivity to market fluctuations.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $151.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $167.64

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The small increase from the previous close ($0.67) is not significant enough to indicate a strong upward reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.296 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.0804 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 336.9% (This represents a substantial expected outperformance over the S&P 500; however, this is a projected value and should be treated with caution.  High expected returns usually indicate higher volatility and risk.)

The slight price increase does not significantly alter the overall bearish technical picture. The high expected return should be considered in the context of the high volatility of the sector and potential risks associated with such a prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
