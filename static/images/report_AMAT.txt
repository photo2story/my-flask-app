**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (31.69):** Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-1.32):**  Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (-7.1%):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance.  The negative change in 'Last Market' data reinforces this short-term negative trend. There is no evidence of a sharp rebound or decline based on the provided data, although the significant negative change in 'Last Market' suggests a potentially continuing decline is possible.
* **Expected Return (244.5%):**  This indicates a substantial potential for outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the investment strategy continues.  However, the recent price decline must be considered, as this is not reflected in the long term expected return.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-02-20 | 1.46   | $7.17B      |
| 2024-08-22 | 2.06   | $6.78B      |
| 2024-05-23 | 2.08   | $6.65B      |
| 2024-02-27 | 2.43   | $6.71B      |
| 2025-02-20 | 2.43   | $6.71B      | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*

Earnings show some volatility. The significant drop in EPS from 2024-02-27 to 2025-02-20 (assuming the duplicate entry is an error and should be discarded) needs further investigation. Revenue shows slight fluctuations around $6.7B-$7.2B.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has historically shown strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent data suggests a short-term decline. While the long-term outlook (supported by the high expected return) remains positive, the current price action, indicated by moving averages and negative PPO, and the recent earnings dip suggest caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent EPS drop and the decrease in ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions. The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the overall trend warrants careful monitoring.  The provided data has some inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings), so verifying the accuracy of the data is important.
