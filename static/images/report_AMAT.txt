## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Analysis

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

AMAT's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price action shows a slight downturn from recent highs, but still above its 20-day moving average.  Financial data indicates strong profitability, although recent earnings show some decline.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.  Its cumulative return of 103.11% substantially exceeds the S&P 500's return of 66.36%, resulting in a substantial positive divergence (36.8%).  The relative divergence of 22.4% indicates that AMAT's performance has been above the S&P 500’s for a significant portion of the observed period, relative to its historical range of performance differences (-24.0% to 247.5%).

The alpha/beta analysis reveals variable performance across different periods.  While some periods show high alpha (outperformance), indicating strong stock-specific performance, others demonstrate negative CAGR and negative alpha, highlighting susceptibility to market downturns (high beta periods).  Note that the significantly high Beta values in recent years (2021-2025) suggest a stronger correlation with overall market movements, implying increased market sensitivity compared to earlier years. The market capitalization (Cap) has generally increased over time, reflecting company growth.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $144.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $138.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $162.83

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, the recent price increase of $4.85 from the previous close could indicate a potential short-term reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk) suggesting caution.
* **RSI:** 43.91 (below 50, suggesting bearish momentum).
* **PPO:** 0.31 (positive, but relatively low)
* **Delta Relative Divergence:** +5.6 (Short-term upward movement).
* **Expected Return:** 369.1% (long-term, 2+ years, relative to S&P 500).  This extremely high expected return should be viewed with skepticism and requires further investigation into its calculation method. The large price increase from the previous day might be a factor contributing to this high number.

The recent price change of $4.85 does represent a significant jump (approximately 3.5%),  potentially indicating a short-term bounce, but it's too early to definitively call it a “sharp rebound”.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-02-20 | 1.46  | $7.17 B       |
| 2024-08-22 | 2.06  | $6.78 B       |
| 2024-05-23 | 2.08  | $6.65 B       |
| 2024-02-27 | 2.43  | $6.71 B       |
| 2025-02-20 | 2.43  | $6.71 B       |

Earnings per share (EPS) shows a recent decline, potentially signaling a slowdown in growth. Revenue is relatively stable, albeit with slight fluctuations.  The apparent duplication of the 2025-02-20 entry suggests a data error and needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|

| 2024-10-31 | $7.04B | 47.34% |
| 2024-07-31 | $6.78B | 47.29% |
| 2024-04-30 | $6.65B | 47.44% |
| 2024-01-31 | $6.71B | 47.77% |

Revenue shows some minor growth and is relatively stable. Profit margins are consistently high, around 47-49%.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-01-31 | $18.62B | 6.36% |
| 2024-10-31 | $19.00B | 9.11% |
| 2024-07-31 | $18.84B | 9.05% |
| 2024-04-30 | $18.20B | 9.46% |
| 2024-01-31 | $17.43B | 11.58% |


Equity has generally increased, although it shows a slight decrease in the most recent quarter. ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated, but overall remains strong.  The significant drop in ROE from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025 warrants further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but recent data suggests a potential slowdown.  While the company maintains high profitability and revenue, recent earnings data indicates a decline in EPS.  Technical indicators show a mixed picture: a high MRI suggests risk, while the relative divergence indicates short-term upward pressure. The current price action is below key moving averages, pointing to potential near-term bearish momentum.  The extremely high projected long-term return needs further justification.  Further investigation into the causes of the declining EPS and ROE, and a review of the methodology used to derive the long-term expected return, are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests that AMAT might be a volatile investment, exhibiting significant correlation with overall market fluctuations.
