## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading provider of materials engineering solutions used in the semiconductor industry.

The cumulative return of AMAT is 311.79%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.09%.  The difference in cumulative return is 190.7%. This places AMAT at the 52nd percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided range of maximum and minimum divergence.  While significantly outperforming the S&P 500, it's important to note that this is a relative measure and doesn't guarantee future performance.

The provided alpha consistently shows a positive value (around 0.1), indicating AMAT has generated returns exceeding the market benchmark. However, the beta values fluctuate significantly (24.9 to 132.2), indicating varying levels of sensitivity to market movements over different periods.  The high beta in recent years points to a higher risk profile.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $181.72
* **5-day Moving Average:** $178.23
* **20-day Moving Average:** $178.61
* **60-day Moving Average:** $176.09

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend in the short to medium term. However, this should be considered in the context of the overall market trends.  The recent price increase (3.67%) indicates a possible upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.8 –  Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO:** -0.34 – Negative value suggesting bearish momentum. This contradicts the recent price increase and needs further investigation.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -4.6 – Shows recent relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500. This may partially explain the negative PPO.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 154.6% – This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term. However, this is a projection and subject to considerable uncertainty.

The discrepancy between the recent price increase and the negative PPO and relative divergence warrants further analysis and consideration of other technical indicators.  The large increase in the last market day does suggest some volatility and market correction could be upcoming.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally remains steady around $6.7B, EPS has shown fluctuations.  The last report shows a drop, suggesting a potential area of concern.  A deeper dive into the factors influencing these fluctuations is recommended.  It's noteworthy that there's a duplicate entry for 2024-08-22.  This data needs clarification.

Equity has shown a steady increase, reflecting positive business performance. ROE, while fluctuating, generally remains positive with a recent dip (potential cause for concern).  This requires further investigation.


| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin | Equity   | ROE     |

| 2023-10-31 | $6.72B   | 47.14%        | $16.35B  | 12.26%  |


**7.  Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, driven by strong profitability and steady revenue. However, recent earnings and technical indicators show some mixed signals.  While the recent price surge is positive, the negative PPO and recent relative underperformance warrant careful consideration.  The high beta suggests higher risk exposure.  A long-term investment strategy, incorporating diversification, is recommended. Further research into the recent dip in EPS and ROE is essential. The conflicting signals require a more nuanced approach than solely relying on the high historical outperformance and long-term projected return.  It is critical to review the duplicated earnings data and clarify the potential causes for the discrepancy.
