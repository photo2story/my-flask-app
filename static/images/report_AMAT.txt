**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.  The cumulative return of AMAT (269.95%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (115.09%) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is 154.9%, placing it at the 43.4th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500 (relative to its maximum and minimum historical outperformance).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $169.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $179.98

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The relatively close proximity to the 5 and 20-day moving averages implies some near-term support but the significant gap with the 60-day MA signals a potential longer-term weakness. The difference between the last market price ($163.97) and the closing price is minimal and does not suggest any drastic recent price movement.

* **RSI:** 40.05 - Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO:** -0.0146 -  Slightly negative, suggesting a bearish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.8% - Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 208.5% - This implies a significantly higher return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, assuming consistent historical outperformance continues. This is a forecast and should be treated cautiously.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

While revenue has shown some fluctuation, there is no clear consistent upward or downward trend.  EPS also shows fluctuation, with peaks in earlier quarters (2024-02-27: $2.43).  There is insufficient data to assess whether these results beat or missed expectations.  The duplication of data for 2024-08-22 is noted and should be verified for accuracy.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT shows strong long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, supported by a high historical CAGR. However, recent price action indicates a potential short-term bearish trend.  Technical indicators suggest a possible oversold condition, which could lead to a short-term price rebound.  While the company maintains high profit margins, recent quarterly earnings show some slight declines in revenue and EPS.  The significant decrease in ROE over the past year needs further investigation. More information is needed regarding recent news and analyst opinions to complete a comprehensive analysis.  Long-term investors might find the high expected return attractive, but caution is warranted given the recent price movement and the declining ROE trend.  Further due diligence is necessary before making any investment decisions.
