## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of materials, equipment, and services to the semiconductor industry.  The cumulative return of AMAT is 322.88%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 128.86%.  The difference is 194.0%, placing it at the 49.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a strong historical outperformance but doesn't guarantee future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $171.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $173.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $179.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $187.58

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (25.79):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce.
* **PPO (-0.25):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-9.4%):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.

The combination of a low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative strength change points to a bearish short-term outlook.  The current price ($171.32) being below the moving averages supports this bearish sentiment. There is no evidence of a sharp recent price movement (either up or down) indicated by the data.  The expected return of 487.9% over the long term (2+ years) represents a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this is a projected figure and subject to market volatility.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue but overall stability.  Revenue consistently stays around $6.6-6.8B.  EPS also shows some variation but remains consistently above $1.80.  To assess the most recent earnings, we need the analyst estimates for the reported quarter (2024-08-22) to determine whether the actual results met or exceeded expectations.  Without this comparison, a definitive judgment on the recent earnings cannot be made.  The duplicated data point for 2024-08-22 needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, with a consistently high profit margin (around 47%).  This suggests strong profitability and operational efficiency.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has steadily increased, and ROE, while fluctuating, is generally high, indicating good returns on investment.

Both sections of the financial information demonstrate the company's healthy financial position and consistent performance.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

AMAT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong revenue and profit margins.  However, recent technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend. The stock price is currently below its moving averages.  The long-term outlook, as indicated by the projected 487.9% return, is positive but highly dependent on future market conditions and the company's sustained performance.  A thorough review of recent news and earnings reports (including analyst forecasts) is crucial to a more complete assessment.
