**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:**  The table shows a wide range of Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) and Maximum Drawdowns (MDD). Notice the very high CAGR in the 2019-2021 period but negative CAGRs more recently.  MDD has generally been high, indicating significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha, representing excess return over the benchmark, is also highly variable.  The negative Alpha values in recent periods are concerning.
*   **Beta:**  Beta fluctuates, generally remaining below 1, indicating that AMAT's volatility is typically less than the overall market (S&P 500). Beta nearing or exceeding 1.0 in the most recent periods (2023-2025) suggests increased sensitivity to market movements, potentially reflecting increased correlation during downturns.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization generally increases over time.

*   **20-day Moving Average:** $190.48
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $172.28

**Analysis:**

*   The stock is trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages but above its 60-day moving average. This suggests a short-term downtrend but a longer-term uptrend. The recent price decrease of -2.84% is notable.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3359 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 54.85 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.84 (Slightly Oversold)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** -3.6 (Indicates short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 277.2% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates low market risk.
*   The RSI is neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The negative PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, suggesting a slightly oversold condition.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending a significant cash position and a small reduction in holdings.
*   The negative change in relative deviation reinforces the short-term downward trend.
*   The extremely high expected return (277.2%) is a very optimistic long-term projection and should be viewed with caution. Such high projections are often based on specific growth assumptions that may not materialize.
