## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading provider of materials engineering solutions used in the semiconductor industry.  This report analyzes AMAT's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), examining its financial metrics, recent performance, and future prospects.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMAT's cumulative return of 121.95% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 82.57%.  The difference is 39.4%, placing it at the 22.6th percentile of its historical range (max: 256.9%, min: -24.2%). This suggests AMAT has outperformed the market over the measured period, though not exceptionally so compared to its historical range.

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta data show varying performance across different time periods.  While some periods exhibit high CAGR and significant Alpha (outperformance relative to the market, indicated by Beta), other periods show negative CAGR and high MDD (maximum drawdown). This highlights the volatility inherent in AMAT's stock. The increasing Beta suggests increasing market sensitivity over time.  The fluctuating market cap underscores the dynamic nature of the semiconductor industry.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $150.17
* **Last Market Price:** $155.1 (a 4.12% increase from the previous close of $148.96 - this suggests a recent rapid upswing)
* **5-day moving average:** $141.01
* **20-day moving average:** $141.08
* **60-day moving average:** $156.91

The price is above the short-term moving averages (5 and 20-day) but below the longer-term moving average (60-day), indicating potential short-term upward momentum but a possible downward correction in the medium term.  The recent rapid price increase warrants further investigation into potential catalysts.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 58.82 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.02 (Positive; suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 374.7% (This is a very high expected return and needs careful consideration. The source and methodology for this calculation need clarification.)

The combination of indicators suggests a moderately bullish outlook, though the extremely high expected return requires further validation.  The recent rapid price increase of 4.12% should be further analyzed for underlying causes.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-02-20 | $1.46  | $7.17B      |

| 2025-02-20 | $2.43  | $6.71B      |


There appears to be a discrepancy in the data as 2025-02-20 is listed twice with conflicting EPS and Revenue.  The data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  A more thorough analysis would require clarifying the discrepancy and examining trends over a longer period.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has demonstrated strong performance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, although its performance has been volatile.  Recent price action shows a potential short-term upward trend, supported by some technical indicators. However, the significant discrepancy in the earnings data and the exceptionally high projected return require further investigation and validation.  A comprehensive analysis should involve a deeper dive into the underlying factors driving the recent price movement and a clarification of the conflicting earnings data. The high volatility suggests careful risk management is crucial for any investment in AMAT.  Further analysis is needed to fully assess the long-term investment potential.
