## Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) is a leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and services.

The cumulative return of AMAT is 297.20%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 119.94%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 177.3%. This places AMAT at the 48.8th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, based on a range of -24.2% to 388.7%.  While significantly outperforming the benchmark, the relative performance is not at an extreme historical high.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance relative to the market (S&P 500) over different time periods.  While Alpha is consistently around 0.1, suggesting some outperformance, Beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.  It's crucial to note that past performance does not guarantee future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $175.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $180.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $177.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $176.08

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent price increase (+$1.41) from the previous close might be a temporary fluctuation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.76 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.40 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -10.7% (Short-term downward trend)

The recent price increase, while positive, doesn't significantly alter the overall bearish short-term technical outlook indicated by the PPO and relative divergence. The expected return of 172.7% is a long-term projection (2+ years) and represents the potential excess return compared to the S&P 500 under a consistent investment strategy.  This high expected return needs to be viewed in the context of higher risk associated with AMAT.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some variability in EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally trends upwards, EPS fluctuates. A more in-depth analysis including a comparison to analyst estimates and industry trends is needed to fully assess the performance.  The duplication of the 2024-08-22 data point should be investigated and corrected.
