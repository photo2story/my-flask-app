The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  More complete financial information (quarterly reports) would be needed to create a comprehensive analysis.  Note the duplication of the 2025-02-20 data.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-20 | 1.46 | 7.17 B$ |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a complete financial analysis. This data is crucial for assessing profitability and financial health.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMAT has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500. However, recent price action shows a short-term bearish trend.  While the long-term expected return is high, this requires further investigation into the basis of the projection.  The incomplete financial data hinders a thorough assessment of AMAT's financial health.  More comprehensive financial statements and clarification on the expected return calculation are needed for a complete and robust analysis.  The relatively high beta suggests that AMAT is a more volatile investment compared to the overall market.  Investors should be aware of this volatility.
