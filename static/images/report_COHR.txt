## Coherent Corp (COHR) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Overview & Key Figures:**

Coherent Corp (COHR) is a leading provider of lasers and photonics technologies.  Key figures show a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (COHR):** 145.88%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** 24.04% (COHR outperformed VOO by 24.04%)
* **Relative Outperformance:** 39.8% (This means COHR's outperformance relative to VOO is in the 39.8th percentile of historical outperformance ranges, considering a minimum difference of -78.4% and maximum difference of 178.9%.)

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals significant volatility in performance and beta (market sensitivity). While periods of high Alpha (outperformance) exist, there are also periods of substantial underperformance (negative Alpha) and high Beta, indicating high sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Note the exceptionally high negative CAGR in 2021-2023 and high Beta values across several periods signify substantial risk.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $86.46
* **Last Market Price:** $86.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $90.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $98.10

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent slight increase from the previous close might be a temporary bounce.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 38.07 (Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.)
* **PPO:** -0.28 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -16.0 (Short-term bearish trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -28.3% (This represents a projected underperformance against the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) holding period, assuming a continued trend.)  This significantly contradicts the cumulative return data provided.  Further clarification on the calculation of the expected return is needed.  The small price increase from the previous close does not suggest a significant price reversal.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-02-05 | $0.46  | $1.43B       |
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.04 | $1.35B       |
| 2024-05-07 | -$0.29 | $1.21B       |
| 2024-02-06 | -$0.38 | $1.13B       |
| 2023-12-31  | -$0.38  | $1.13B       |


Earnings show significant volatility. While the most recent quarter shows positive EPS, previous quarters show negative EPS, indicating inconsistent profitability. Revenue is generally increasing, but the profitability is questionable.  Duplicate data exists for 2025-02-05 and requires correction.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.43B | 35.50%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.35B | 34.13%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.31B | 32.86%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.21B | 30.32%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.13B | 30.99%       |

Revenue shows a clear upward trend. Profit margins are also generally increasing, suggesting improved profitability.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $7.60B | 1.36% |
| 2024-09-30 | $5.50B | 0.47% |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.57B | -0.64% |
| 2024-03-31 | $7.67B | -0.17% |
| 2023-12-31 | $7.77B | -0.35% |

Equity fluctuates, and ROE shows periods of both positive and negative returns.  Inconsistency in equity figures needs to be addressed.

**6.  Overall Analysis:**

COHR has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative returns, but this is accompanied by high volatility and risk as shown by the highly fluctuating CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta.  Recent price action suggests a downtrend, supported by technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages).  While revenue is growing and profit margins are improving, earnings show inconsistency, and the expected return is significantly negative.  The discrepancies between the historical cumulative return and the predicted long-term return need further investigation and clarification.  Thorough due diligence is necessary before making any investment decisions, considering the high risk associated with the stock's volatility and the conflicting information provided.  The inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings data, equity fluctuation) must be resolved for a more accurate and reliable analysis.
