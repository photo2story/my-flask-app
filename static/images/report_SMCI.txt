| 2023-2025  | 170.0% | 79.1%  | 105.0% | 0.6    | 18.4   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows a volatile past, with significant negative periods in the early years, followed by explosive growth in recent years, especially from 2020 onwards. The recent CAGR from 2023-2025 is still very high, but lower than previous years.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant price volatility and risk. It shows that SMCI can experience large drops from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is very positive in recent periods, meaning SMCI has been generating excess returns compared to its risk-adjusted expected return, a trend that has sharply increased since 2020.
*   **Beta:**  The Beta values have been low historically, even negative, implying that SMCI's price movement was not strongly correlated with the overall market. More recently, however, Beta has turned positive, indicating some increased market correlation.
*   **Cap(B):** The Market Capitalization (Cap(B)) has increased substantially in recent years, reflecting the company's growth and investor interest.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 31.11
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 30.76, Previous Close: 31.07, Change: -1.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 30.67
*   **20-day SMA:** 32.9272
*   **60-day SMA:** 42.6017

**Analysis:** SMCI's current price is below its 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), and significantly below its 60-day SMA. This suggests a recent downtrend in the stock price.  The negative change in the last market data supports this.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.56
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.0175
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.9 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 2463.5% (Long-term, compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A rating of 0.8 indicates medium investment risk, based on the indicators.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 50, suggesting that the stock is not overbought, but not yet oversold. A value of 40.56 indicates some downward price pressure.
*   **PPO:** The PPO value is close to zero, suggesting relatively neutral price momentum in the short term.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a "Buy" recommendation, but with a small position size due to the medium risk.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** This confirms the recent price weakness.
*   **Expected Return:** The extraordinarily high expected return indicates significant potential upside if held long-term, relative to the S&P 500. However, this high expectation should be viewed with caution due to the stock's volatility. The expected return could be an algorithm error due to small capitalization in the past.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

The news headlines paint a mixed picture:

*   Several articles discuss the possibility of SMCI's stock recovering after a recent sell-off, and one even addresses whether the stock can recover if it falls another 30%. This confirms the recent price weakness suggested by the technical indicators.
*   Articles compare SMCI to other companies in the AI space, suggesting intense competition.
*   One headline mentions a large sale of SMCI shares by the Texas Permanent School Fund Corp, which could be contributing to the recent price decline.
*   Another headline mentions concerns about SMCI's financial performance.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Mixed, and appears to have missing or incomplete data. No clear consensus.
*   **Target Price:** Wide range, from \$15.00 to \$93.00, indicating significant uncertainty among analysts.

**Analysis:**

The lack of a strong analyst consensus and the wide range in target prices suggest considerable uncertainty surrounding SMCI's future prospects.

*   The financial data shows fluctuating revenue and declining profit margins and ROE, which could be contributing to investor concerns.
*   Analyst opinions are mixed, reflecting uncertainty about the company's future prospects. The extremely high expected return should be taken with caution given the volatility and risk profile of SMCI.
*   While the MRI suggests a medium investment, the high MDD, recent price weakness, and uncertain analyst outlook warrant caution.
*   SMCI remains a potentially high-reward investment, particularly given the expected return but it also carries a substantial level of risk. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions.
