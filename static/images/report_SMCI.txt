**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** SMCI's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has varied widely.  The recent periods (2019-2025) show extremely high growth, reflecting the company's success in the AI server market.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant volatility, consistently high across all periods. This suggests SMCI is a high-risk, high-reward stock.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the stock's performance above the benchmark (market).  The consistently positive and high Alpha values indicate SMCI has generated significant excess returns.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. SMCI's Beta has been increasing (1.2 to 2.4), indicating that it has become more volatile than the S&P 500.
*   **Market Cap:** The market capitalization has grown significantly, especially in recent years, indicating investor confidence and market recognition.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close Price:** $29.27
*   **Last Market:** The price decreased by $1.28
*   **Moving Averages:** The 5-day SMA ($30.04) is below the 20-day SMA ($31.98), which is below the 60-day SMA ($40.39). This suggests a downtrend in the short to medium term.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended). This indicates the model suggests a high likelihood of profitable investment, but this recommendation should be considered cautiously given the other indicators.
*   **RSI:** 21.48.  This is significantly below 30, indicating that the stock is oversold and *may* be due for a rebound. However, oversold conditions can persist.
*   **PPO:** 0.2794. PPO value is greater than 0, it means that the recent close price is greater than the old average price. (Positive, upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80).  This signal is suggesting a strong buy with almost all available cash.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -1.1 (Negative), indicating a short-term decrease in relative divergence. This aligns with the recent price decline.
*   **Expected Return:** 4521.93%. This exceptionally high expected return should be viewed with skepticism. It likely reflects the model's extrapolation of recent high growth rates, which may not be sustainable.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Focus on AI Servers:** Several articles highlight SMCI's focus on AI servers and expansion in this area, particularly related to xAI. This aligns with the company's recent performance and suggests continued growth potential.
*   **Liquid Cooling Innovation:** The new liquid-cooled SuperBlade launch is a positive development, demonstrating innovation and addressing the increasing power demands of AI applications.
*   **Executive Change & Price Drop:** The 8-K filing regarding an executive change coincides with a stock price drop. This suggests the market reacted negatively to the news, potentially due to uncertainty about the transition.
*   **Seeking Alpha Article:** The "Most Mispriced Phase" article suggests that the market may be undervaluing SMCI, implying potential upside.
*   **Analyst Concerns:** The headline "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Suffers a Larger Drop Than the General Market" indicates the company is facing some headwinds.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   The analyst consensus is neutral (no clear buy/sell recommendation).
*   The average target price is $48.53, significantly higher than the current price of $29.27. However, there's a wide range between the high ($93.00) and low ($15.00) target prices, indicating a lack of strong consensus.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-11-07 | 0.28 | 5.02 B$     |
| 2025-05-12 | 0.18 | 4.60 B$     |

| 2025-11-07 | 0.72 | 5.94 B$     |

**Analysis:**

*   The table shows earnings (EPS) and revenue figures for recent quarters. There appear to be repeated dates, which is highly suspicious and suggests potential data errors. The EPS and revenue are fluctuating, not trending strongly in either direction.  Assuming the repeated dates indicate missing quarterly data, further investigation and a reliable data source are crucial.

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has fluctuated over the past five quarters but has generally remained high.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have declined, from a high of 13.06% to a low of 9.31%. This trend should be monitored closely.
*   **Equity:** Equity has been growing steadily, indicating financial stability.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) has also declined, reflecting the declining profit margins.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

SMCI has experienced tremendous growth and outperformed the market significantly, fueled by its focus on AI servers. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) signals "High Investment Recommended." However, a more cautious approach is warranted due to several factors:

*   **Recent Price Decline:** The stock is in a short-term downtrend, with the price below its moving averages, and the recent divergence change is negative.
*   **Executive Departure:** An executive change has unsettled the market.
*   **Declining Profitability:** Profit margins and ROE have been decreasing.
*   **High Volatility:** The MDD and increasing Beta indicate high volatility, making it a high-risk investment.
*   **Unreliable Earnings Data:** The duplicated dates in the earnings data raise significant concerns about data accuracy.
*   **High Expected Return:** The extremely high "Expected Return" is likely an overestimation based on recent growth rates and should not be relied upon.
*   **RSI Oversold:** The stock is currently oversold according to the RSI, suggesting a potential short-term rebound, but oversold conditions can persist.

**Conclusion:**

SMCI presents a mixed picture. The company is undoubtedly benefiting from the AI boom, and its focus on innovation is positive. However, the recent price decline, executive change, declining profitability, and data concerns warrant caution. While the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, a more conservative approach is advisable.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Exercise Caution:** Given the mixed signals, investors should exercise caution.
*   **Monitor Data Accuracy:** Verify the accuracy of the earnings data.
*   **Observe Price Action:** Monitor the stock's price action for signs of stabilization or further decline.
*   **Consider a Smaller Position:** If considering an investment, start with a smaller position to manage risk.
*   **Diversify:** Ensure a well-diversified portfolio to mitigate the risks associated with SMCI's high volatility.
*   **Stay Informed:** Keep abreast of news and developments regarding SMCI and the broader AI server market.
