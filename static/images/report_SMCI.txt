**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-11-07 | 0.28 | 5.02 B$    |
| 2025-05-12 | 0.18 | 4.60 B$    |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The earnings data is a bit confusing due to duplicate dates. Assuming the more recent entries are most accurate, we see a mixed picture. The EPS has fluctuated, and the most recent EPS figure of 0.28 is lower compared to the previous 0.72, but the revenue of 5.94B is maintained at the previous period. It's important to investigate why EPS is down.
    *   Overall, while revenue has been strong, recent EPS figures suggest a potential slowing of profitability growth or increased costs.
