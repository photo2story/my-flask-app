**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR shows strong growth in recent periods (2020-2025), indicating significant performance. But looking back from 2015 to 2019, it shows weakness in the market.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently high, suggesting the stock experiences significant price drops from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is largely positive in recent years, particularly from 2020 onwards, indicating that the stock has generated excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its beta. Before 2020, it was largely negative.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates, and is showing a sign of increasing in recent years.
*   **Cap(B) Market Capitalization in Billions:** This clearly indicates the growing scale of the company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 30.64
*   **Last-market:**  {'price': 30.64, 'previousClose': 30.55, 'change': 0.29}
*   **5-day SMA:** 30.83
*   **20-day SMA:** 32.54
*   **60-day SMA:** 41.44

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This suggests a potential short-term downward trend. The small change between the 'previousClose' and 'price' may indicate the market stability but still be mindful of the downward trend due to the figures of SMA.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 29.02
*   **PPO:** 0.43

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.9 (-): Short-term Decline
*   **Expected Return (%):** 2463.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  The MRI of 1.0 suggests a favorable market environment for investment.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 29.02 indicates that the stock is approaching oversold conditions, which could suggest a potential buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:**  The PPO of 0.43 (relatively low) doesn't give enough information.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  This signal advises for full investment, suggesting confidence in the stock, but the low MRI of 0.8 raises questions.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms the recent downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return suggests significant potential upside if held long-term.
