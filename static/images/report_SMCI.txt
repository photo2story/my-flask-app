2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the SMCI data you provided, followed by analysis.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** SMCI (Super Micro Computer Inc)
*   **Company Overview:** Super Micro Computer Inc. is a company that develops and manufactures high-performance server and storage solutions based on modular and open architecture.
*   **SMCI Cumulative Return:** 338.22%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** 225.5 (Relative Divergence: 15.6)

**Analysis:**

SMCI has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The cumulative return is vastly greater, indicating substantial growth compared to the overall market. The divergence of 225.5 shows the magnitude of this outperformance. A relative divergence of 15.6 suggests that the current divergence, while substantial, isn't at the very extreme of its historical range (it's 15.6% up from the lowest divergence). This indicates there might be potential for further divergence, but also a risk of mean reversion.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 141.0% | 82.6% | 79.0%   | 2.4  | 17.5   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over each period. CAGR has dramatically increased in recent periods, reflecting strong growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. MDD is relatively high, especially in the most recent period (82.6%), indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the excess return compared to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). Positive and high Alpha values (especially in recent years) confirm the significant outperformance of SMCI.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta above 1 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the market. Beta has steadily increased, especially in the last period, indicating it has become very volatile in comparison to the S&P500.
*   **Cap(B):** Represents market capitalization in billions.  Market cap has increased dramatically, reflecting the company's growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 30.96
*   **Previous Close:** 29.27
*   **Change:** 5.77
*   **5-day SMA:** 30.12
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.84
*   **60-day SMA:** 39.99

**Analysis:**

The current price is above the 5-day SMA but below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a short-term upward trend (price recently increased over the 5-day average), but it is still below longer-term averages. The current price increase has a large change from previous close which suggests a potential sharp rebound. This could indicate some potential consolidation around the current price level. The significant gap between the 60-day SMA and the current price could signal a potential resistance level.

**3) Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 35.67
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.61
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (29 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 3047.1% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term from this point)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, indicating moderate risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 35.67 is near the oversold territory (below 30), potentially signaling a buying opportunity. However, it's crucial to consider this in conjunction with other indicators.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, generally indicating an upward trend, albeit a weaker one since the value is close to zero.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends to buy 90% of cash (29 shares) and indicates a safe investment.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence suggests a short-term decline in performance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return suggests significant potential for long-term growth, but should be viewed with caution. Such a high number may reflect the volatile nature of the stock and past growth rates that may not be sustainable.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive News:** Recent news focuses on new AI server launches ("Super Micro Computer Just Launched a New AI Server," "Super Micro (SMCI) stock dips after-hours after liquid‑cooled SuperBlade launch"), analyst optimism ("Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Offers ‘Multi-Dimensional Opportunity,’ Says Analyst"), and reasons for stock gains ("Why Is Super Micro Stock Gaining Friday?").
*   **Negative News:** There is also news about a larger drop than the general market and executive changes ("Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Suffers a Larger Drop Than the General Market," "Why Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock is down today: 8-K exec change").

**Analysis:**

The news is a mixed bag. The positive news surrounding new product launches and analyst outlooks are bullish. However, the news about a recent price drop and executive changes introduces some uncertainty. It's important to evaluate the nature and impact of the executive change. Was it a planned departure or something more concerning?

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** No explicit consensus rating provided (Key: None, Mean: -).

*   **Target Price:** Average: $48.53, High: $93.00, Low: $15.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No specific rating changes are provided ( → ()).

**Analysis:**

The wide range in target prices ($15 to $93) indicates significant disagreement among analysts regarding SMCI's future value. The average target price of $48.53 is significantly higher than the current price of $30.96 suggesting an upside potential if the average analyst consensus is to be believed.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue   |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-11-07 | 0.28 | 5.02 B$   |

| 2025-11-07 | 0.72 | 5.94 B$   |

**Analysis:**

It appears there are duplicated values. There is a general trend of growth in revenue which likely coincides with the company's growth in capitalization and price. EPS is generally growing with a fluctuation in EPS between 0.18 and 0.72 which might signal volatility.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

SMCI has demonstrated remarkable growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by its exposure to the growing AI server market. However, there are factors indicating increased risk:

*   **High Volatility:**  The high Beta and MDD figures confirm this is a volatile stock.
*   **Valuation Concerns:** The enormous growth in market capitalization and the high expected return might reflect a potentially stretched valuation. The wide range of analyst price targets reflects differing opinions on valuation.
*   **Recent Weakness:**  Recent news of a price drop and the negative short-term divergence change suggest a possible cooling-off period or a correction. Profit margins and ROE is also decreasing, potentially signaling cost management issues.
*   **Executive Change:** Executive changes introduce uncertainty.

**Overall:**

SMCI presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. Its future growth is highly dependent on the continued expansion of the AI server market and the company's ability to maintain its competitive edge and manage its costs effectively. The stock could be considered for a risky, high-growth portion of a diversified portfolio, but caution is warranted. Further investigation into the reasons for the recent weakness, the executive change, and a careful evaluation of the company's long-term growth prospects are crucial before making an investment decision.
