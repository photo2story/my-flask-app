The hybrid signal's recommendation to buy a partial position with a cash allocation seems appropriate. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in AMT, and closely monitor the company's performance and any further news or developments. The significant deviation from the S&P 500 warrants further investigation into the underlying causes and potential for recovery.
