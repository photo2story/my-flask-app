*   **Return Divergence:** AMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a divergence of -111.5. Its relative divergence is 0.5, indicating it is currently positioned at the very bottom of past performance fluctuations. This shows extreme recent underperformance relative to the market.

*   **Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Table:**

    *   **Past Performance Volatility:**  AMT's historical performance is highly variable. Some periods show very strong CAGR (2017-2019), while others demonstrate negative returns (2020-2025).
    *   **High Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** Consistently high MDD figures (around 70-80%) suggest significant downside risk during the analyzed periods. This means that if you invested, your returns could have been cut up to that amount.
    *   **Alpha & Beta Changes:** Alpha, measuring excess return relative to a benchmark, shifted from positive values in earlier periods to negative values more recently, mirroring the performance divergence. Beta, measuring volatility relative to the market, has generally been low but recently increased towards 1. This indicates increased correlation with market volatility.
    *   **Capitalization:** Cap(B) has decreased in recent years. This suggests that the company's market capitalization has decreased in recent years, indicating a decline in its overall value.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 suggests that according to this specific indicator, AMT is considered a medium-to-high-risk investment, but an investment is recommended.
*   **RSI:** 34.26 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, but in the context of the other information, doesn't necessarily mean a quick rebound.

*   **Institutional Investment:** SWS Partners holding a significant stake ($16.69 million) indicates institutional confidence.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

AMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently.  The technical indicators paint a mixed picture.  The RSI is approaching oversold, suggesting a potential bounce, but the negative expected return and recent trend of underperformance are major concerns.

The analyst consensus is positive, with a "Buy" rating and significantly higher target prices.  Recent news is a mixture of positive (institutional ownership, dividend focus, articles suggesting upside) and negative (rating downgrade).

**Overall Assessment:**

Investing in AMT at this point appears risky, with potential for reward. The negative expected return is a major red flag, and the negative divergence relative to the market indicates continued recent underperformance. While analysts are generally bullish, the technical indicators and recent price action suggest caution. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before investing in AMT. The analyst's opinion that there is upside potential and the market risk indicator of 0.9 might indicate that the market considers the stock more attractive.
