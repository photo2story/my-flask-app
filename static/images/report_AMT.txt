## American Tower Corp (AMT) Investment Report

This report analyzes American Tower Corp (AMT), a global real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast infrastructure.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

AMT's cumulative return of 48.21% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 122.18% over the analyzed period.  The provided data shows a substantial divergence of -74.0%, placing it at the 3.6th percentile of its historical range of divergence (min -80.2%, max 90.9%).  This indicates AMT's underperformance relative to the broader market.  The alpha consistently shows near zero, suggesting its returns are largely explained by market movements (beta).  While past CAGR is high in some periods, the recent negative CAGR and high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures raise concerns.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $207.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $207.78
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $202.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $216.95

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting recent downward pressure.  It's above the 20-day moving average, indicating a relatively short-term bullish trend. However, it sits below the 60-day moving average, showing a longer-term bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (76.85):**  Indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (0.66):** Suggests bullish momentum, although the RSI counteracts this.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-1.7):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data shows a zero expected return relative to the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment. This is crucial and requires further investigation considering the historical data.  A 0% expected return suggests that the investment might not outperform the market.  The current price of $207.10 is not significantly different from the moving averages, indicating no sharp recent price movement (neither a significant jump nor a drop).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility:

* **EPS:** Fluctuates widely, with a recent quarterly loss (-$1.7) following positive results in previous quarters.  This negative EPS is a major concern.
* **Revenue:** Remains relatively stable around $0.19-$0.20 billion, though some fluctuation is present.  There's no clear consistent revenue growth trend.
* **Notable Beats or Misses:**  The provided data doesn't include expected EPS or revenue figures, preventing a precise evaluation of beats or misses. However, the negative EPS in the most recent quarter is a significant miss.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuations but generally remains around $2.5B-$2.9B.
* **Profit Margin:** Generally high (70-74%), indicating strong profitability.
* **Equity:** Shows a downward trend, from $4.53B in 2023 Q3 to $3.64B in 2024 Q3.
* **ROE:** Highly volatile, ranging from -21.76% to 23.35%, indicating significant fluctuations in profitability relative to shareholder equity.  The negative ROE in the most recent quarter is especially concerning.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMT shows mixed signals. While it historically exhibited strong growth in some periods, recent performance has been weak.  The negative EPS, declining equity, volatile ROE, and significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raise serious concerns.  The high RSI suggests potential near-term downward correction. Although the profit margins are high, the negative recent EPS and the overall recent negative CAGR are worrying signs.  The 0% expected return also implies that an investment in AMT might not outperform passive investing in the S&P 500.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons for the recent decline in EPS, the market outlook, and analyst opinions to make a well-informed investment decision.  Consideration of additional factors (debt, future growth projections, competitive landscape) beyond this report's scope are crucial.
