**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

American Tower Corp. (AMT) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting negative CAGR and Alpha in recent years, coupled with high MDD. While the MRI suggests a favorable investment environment, the RSI approaching oversold, and a small short-term uptick in relative divergence may present a possible buying opportunity, these are overshadowed by the sustained underperformance and an expected return of 0.0% compared to the S&P 500.

Analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus with a target price well above the current level, indicating potential upside. However, this contrasts with the company's recent struggles.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Despite the analyst "Buy" ratings, **caution is advised.** The data points to a struggling stock, and the potential short-term gains indicated by the RSI and divergence changes may not outweigh the long-term underperformance. Further due diligence is crucial to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the basis for the optimistic analyst outlook. It's also important to examine insider buying trends to understand management's confidence in the company. If you are risk-averse, AMT is not a stock for you.
