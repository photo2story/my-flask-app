Understanding the specific reasons behind the underperformance and volatility is crucial before making an investment decision. The very high expected return is tempting, but must be weighed against the risks. The Hybrid Signal suggesting a partial buy could be considered by investors with a high risk tolerance willing to dollar cost average, but thorough due diligence is absolutely necessary.
