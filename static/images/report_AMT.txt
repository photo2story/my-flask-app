## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

American Tower Corp (AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure.

The provided data shows AMT's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between AMT and VOO at the last date in the data is approximately -88.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -88.4 places AMT at the 0.3 percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500. This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data also shows periods of strong growth and significant negative returns in recent years (2022-2024), highlighting volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $186.39
* **5-day Moving Average:** $188.41
* **20-day Moving Average:** $182.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** $194.84

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  However, it's above its 20-day moving average, indicating some short-term support. The recent price change of $0.59 (0.32% increase) is not significant enough to denote a significant upward or downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.71 (slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.94 (positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -1.0 (indicates short-term bearish momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -1176.8% (This extremely negative value needs further clarification. It's likely an error or requires additional context regarding the calculation methodology.  It's unrealistic for an investment to have such a significant negative expected return.)

The relatively low RSI and negative short-term relative divergence suggest caution despite the positive PPO. The extremely negative expected return requires further investigation and clarification.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There was a substantial drop in EPS in the most recent quarter (2024-10-29), which contrasts with the preceding quarters' positive results.  Revenue has remained relatively stable around $0.19 Billion, but profit margins are declining.  There's a potential data error with the duplicate entry of 2024-10-29. This inconsistency necessitates a review of the data source's reliability.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-29 | -1.7  | $0.19B        |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.93  | $0.20B        |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.97  | $0.18B        |
| 2023-10-26 | 1.26  | $0.19B        |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.26  | $0.19B        |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data exhibits a mixed picture.  Revenue remains relatively stable and high, with consistently high profit margins. However, equity has been decreasing, and ROE shows significant volatility, including a negative ROE in the latest quarter.  This suggests potential concerns about the company's profitability and financial health.

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin | Equity   | ROE       |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30  | $2.52B      | 74.16%        | $3.64B  | -21.76%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $2.90B      | 71.66%        | $3.86B  | 23.35%    |
| 2024-03-31  | $2.83B      | 72.19%        | $4.05B  | 22.66%    |
| 2023-12-31  | $2.79B      | 70.88%        | $4.20B  | 2.02%     |
| 2023-09-30  | $2.52B      | 74.69%        | $4.53B  | 12.95%    |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMT has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with considerable volatility in both price and earnings. While revenue and profit margins remain relatively strong, the recent decline in EPS, decreasing equity, and volatile ROE raise concerns about the company's financial health.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal, with some suggesting a potential downward trend. The extremely negative expected return figure requires urgent clarification and verification.  Further investigation into the source of the -1176.8% expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entries) also necessitate a review of data accuracy.  Given the current information, caution is advised.
