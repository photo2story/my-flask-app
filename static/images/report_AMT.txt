**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.81 - Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.49 - A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -4.26 - Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  This indicates that at current levels and given historical data, no significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is anticipated over a long-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold strategy. The 0% expected return should be interpreted cautiously, as it is a relative measure against the S&P 500 and may not reflect absolute returns.  The low expected return further reinforces the negative relative performance.


**4. Recent Financial Performance & Outlook:**

The recent earnings show some volatility. While Q2 and Q3 2024 showed positive EPS, Q4 2024 showed a significant decline.  Revenue has remained relatively stable, but declining EPS warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.  A comparison with analyst estimates for Q4 2024 would provide additional context.  The provided data lacks the crucial element of analyst estimates.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively consistent, while profit margins have fluctuated but generally stayed high. This suggests strong revenue generation but variable profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Return on Equity (ROE) has shown significant volatility, ranging from a high of 23.35% to a low of -21.76%. This signals fluctuating profitability and financial health which requires a more thorough analysis of the underlying drivers.
