## American Tower Corp (AMT) Analysis

**Company Overview:** American Tower Corp is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops multitenant communications real estate.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **AMT Cumulative Return:** -4.83%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 96.68%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** -102.5 (AMT significantly underperforming VOO)
*   **Relative Divergence:** 0.4 (AMT's underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range)

**Analysis of Alpha/Beta and CAGR/MDD:**

The table presents a mixed picture. The earlier years (2015-2019) show strong CAGR and positive Alpha. However, recent years (2020-2025) show negative CAGR and significantly negative Alpha, indicating substantial underperformance relative to the market. The Beta values are generally low, indicating that AMT's price does not move directionally with the S&P500.
*   **CAGR and MDD**: High MDD across all periods indicates high volatility. More recently, negative CAGR demonstrates poor returns on investment.
*   **Alpha and Beta**: Negative Alpha in recent years reflects underperformance relative to the S&P 500. Low Beta values suggest AMT's returns are relatively independent of broader market movements.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** \$183.20
*   **Previous Close:** \$186.68
*   **Change:** -\$1.86
*   **5-day Moving Average:** \$185.69
*   **20-day Moving Average:** \$190.96
*   **60-day Moving Average:** \$202.22

**Analysis:** The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The recent drop indicates negative momentum.

**3. Indicators and Signals**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI:** 25.07 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.173
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_1.70
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.4 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3486.2% (Significant underperformance vs S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which *could* signal a potential for a rebound.  The negative PPO reinforces the bearish trend. The large negative Expected Return is a significant concern. Recent divergence change hints at a slight positive shift in relative performance, but not enough to offset the overall negative outlook. The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a Buy recommendation based on safety and dividend, but this contrasts sharply with other negative indicators. The recent price change {price': 183.2, 'previousClose': 186.68, 'change': -1.86} shows the price is still falling.

**4. Recent News & Events**

*   **Jefferies Adjusts Price Target:** Lowered to \$226 from \$281, but maintains a Buy rating.
*   **CoreSite Expansion:**  Positive news regarding data center development and expansion.
*   **Verizon Lease Uncertainty:** Concerns about potential impact on American Tower's growth.
*   **Dividend Stock Mention:** Listed as a potentially solid dividend stock.

**Analysis:** The news presents a mixed picture. The lowered price target from Jefferies is concerning, despite the maintained Buy rating.  The CoreSite expansion is positive for long-term growth. The Verizon lease uncertainty is a significant risk factor.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.73)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** \$246.32 / \$281.00 / \$217.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes are given.

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus remains positive, with a "Buy" recommendation and a significant upside potential based on the average target price. However, it's crucial to consider the lowered price target from Jefferies and the potential risks highlighted in the news.

**5. Overall Assessment**

American Tower (AMT) presents a complex investment picture.

**Bearish Signals:**

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, further research and due diligence are strongly recommended. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon.
