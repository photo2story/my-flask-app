The provided earnings data shows inconsistent performance:

* **EPS:** Fluctuates significantly, with a recent loss (-$1.7). This indicates a downturn in profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information not provided in the prompt.  Specifically, it requires recent news articles covering AMT's earnings announcements, market outlooks, and analyst opinions to provide a full analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) shows signs of significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, marked by a considerable negative divergence. Recent price movements indicate a downward trend, supported by bearish technical indicators (RSI, PPO). The reported earnings show inconsistent performance, with a concerning drop in EPS and a recent net loss. The high volatility in ROE and the dramatic drop in Equity are major red flags.  The extremely negative expected return is likely erroneous and needs clarification.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the declining EPS, revenue stagnation, and negative ROE are crucial before forming a strong opinion.  The lack of information on recent news and analyst opinions hinders a complete assessment.  Overall, the current situation appears bearish.

Given the significant underperformance, bearish technical indicators, and concerning financial results, a cautious approach is recommended.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the recent negative performance, including an examination of recent news and analyst reports, is absolutely necessary before making any investment decisions.  The provided extremely negative expected return should be disregarded without further clarification and verification.  Currently, the data suggests AMT is a high-risk investment.
