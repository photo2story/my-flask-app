## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

American Tower Corp (AMT), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure, has shown significantly lower cumulative returns (46.8%) compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 112.9% over an unspecified period. While exhibiting high growth periods (CAGR exceeding 80% in some years), recent years have seen negative returns, marked by substantial maximum drawdowns (MDD).  Technical indicators suggest near overbought conditions (RSI > 70) and a positive divergence (Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence).  However, the projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is significantly negative.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

American Tower Corp's cumulative return lags behind the S&P 500 by a substantial margin (-66.0%). This places its relative performance at the 12.7th percentile compared to the historical range of its performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high growth potential in certain periods (CAGR up to 89%), punctuated by significant drawdowns (MDD up to -87%).  The positive alpha values suggest outperformance in some periods, but this is inconsistent and overshadowed by recent negative returns. The high beta (ranging from 0.0 to 0.9) indicates substantial sensitivity to market movements. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) reveals significant growth over the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $203.97
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $198.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $191.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $189.56

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price increase of $1.61 (from $200.73) reflects a modest, positive change.  

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 70.47 – approaching overbought territory (generally considered >70).
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.81 – suggests potential upward momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +9.8 – indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength.


The significant price change of $1.61, while not a dramatic jump, is noteworthy in the context of the other indicators.  It does not suggest a *rapid* surge.

The projected expected return of -97.1% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a crucial concern, suggesting a significant underperformance is anticipated.

**Conclusion:**

While AMT has demonstrated periods of strong growth, its recent performance and projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 are concerning. The high beta highlights its market sensitivity.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for future growth against the substantial risk indicated by the negative expected return and volatile historical performance before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the factors driving the recent negative performance and the basis of the significantly negative long-term expected return is warranted.
