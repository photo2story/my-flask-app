**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

AMT's cumulative return of 48.68% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 108.99% over the analyzed period.  This results in a divergence of -60.3%, placing it at the 15.9th percentile of the historical divergence range (-88.9% to 91.0%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta), with high CAGR periods interspersed with substantial drawdowns (MDD).  While Alpha is generally positive, indicating some degree of outperformance in certain periods, it is not consistently strong.  The high beta values suggest significant market sensitivity.  The significant negative CAGR from 2020-2024 indicates a period of considerable underperformance.   The increase in Beta in the later years suggests increased volatility and correlation with the broader market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

AMT's closing price is $207.12.  The price decreased by $1.19 (-0.57%) compared to the previous close.  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($205.41), 20-day ($194.36), and 60-day ($189.63) moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (68.33):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.92):** Positive value indicates upward momentum, but needs further context with price action.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+5.1):** Shows short-term upward momentum in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-75.8%):**  This extremely negative figure indicates a substantial projected underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This  requires careful consideration and may warrant further investigation into the underlying assumptions of this calculation.  A -75.8% projected return is unusually negative and needs to be examined critically to determine its validity.


**Conclusion:**

AMT has demonstrated significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some periods show positive alpha and upward momentum,  consistent negative performance in recent years raises concerns. The high Beta and recent price action below moving averages suggest a bearish trend. The extremely negative long-term expected return requires additional scrutiny before making any investment decisions.  Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in AMT.  Further fundamental analysis and a review of the methodology used to generate the expected return (-75.8%) are crucial.
