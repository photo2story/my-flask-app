Long-term investments are always subject to risk and market fluctuations.

**Conclusion:**

AMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but this outperformance is not consistent across all periods.  The high MDD values highlight considerable risk. While recent price action and indicators suggest a short-term positive trend, the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the risk profile warrants careful consideration before investment.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and future prospects, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
