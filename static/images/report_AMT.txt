## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communication infrastructure.  The provided data shows a significantly lower cumulative return for AMT compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over a certain period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this underperformance.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **AMT Cumulative Return:** 36.32%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** -85.5%
* **Relative Divergence:** 1.9% (Indicates AMT's performance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500).

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR was high in some periods, recent years (2020-2025) have shown significant negative returns, highlighting a potential issue with the company's performance.  The high Beta values suggest that AMT's price is highly sensitive to overall market movements.  The large cap size indicates it is a relatively large company.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $189.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $190.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $187.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $190.50

The price is slightly below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend, but above the 20-day moving average suggesting some support.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.45  (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, indicating a slightly bearish sentiment).
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.32 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum but relatively weak).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.6% (Indicates a recent short-term decline relative to the S&P 500).
* **Expected Return:** -709.6% (This extremely negative figure requires further investigation and clarification.  It likely reflects a significant downside risk relative to the S&P 500 based on current analysis).

The extremely negative expected return is a significant red flag and needs further explanation as to how it was calculated.
