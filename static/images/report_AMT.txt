## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Report

**Executive Summary:** American Tower Corp (AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure globally.  This report analyzes AMT's performance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), incorporating recent price movements and technical indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AMT's cumulative return of 87.61% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's 76.08% return (a difference of 11.5 percentage points).  The relative divergence of 38.7% indicates that AMT's outperformance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. However, this is based on historical data and doesn't guarantee future performance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals varying performance across different periods:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                  |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| 2015-2017  | 42.0% | 66.4% | 9.0%  | 0.1   | 55.9   | Relatively low beta, high alpha           |
| 2016-2018  | 42.0% | 67.8% | 21.0% | 0.3   | 63.3   | Higher beta than 2015-2017, high alpha    |
| 2017-2019  | 86.0% | 67.8% | 52.0% | 0.2   | 93.6   | Strong performance, moderate beta         |
| 2018-2020  | 34.0% | 67.8% | 4.0%  | 0.2   | 93.2   | Lower CAGR, moderate beta                  |
| 2019-2021  | 63.0% | 64.2% | 3.0%  | 0.2   | 123.8  | Solid performance, moderate beta         |
| 2020-2022  | -19.0%| 70.6% | -28.0%| 0.3   | 92.0   | Negative return, higher beta, low alpha |
| 2021-2023  | -4.0% | 70.6% | -24.0%| 0.7   | 97.0   | Negative return, high beta, low alpha     |
| 2022-2024  | -12.0%| 70.6% | -32.0%| 0.7   | 85.2   | Negative return, high beta, low alpha     |
| 2023-2025  | 14.0% | 68.2% | 0.0%  | 0.4   | 102.0  | Positive return, moderate beta             |


The high alpha values in some periods suggest AMT outperformed the market. However, the recent negative CAGR and the high beta in the later periods highlight the increased market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $218.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $214.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $213.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $201.41

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the moving averages indicates a recent period of relative stability.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)  Suggests a moderate level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 55.15 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold).
* **PPO:** -0.099 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum, though relatively close to zero).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.1 (Positive, indicating short-term upward momentum).
* **Expected Return:** -1.6%  This indicates a negative expected return in the very short term. However, the long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not provided, making a conclusion about long-term outperformance impossible. The price change from the previous close is negligible (-$0.01), so no significant event is evident.


**Conclusion:**

AMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting periods of high alpha. However, recent performance has been weaker, and the increased beta suggests greater market sensitivity.  While current indicators point to a relatively neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, further analysis is needed before making strong recommendations. The lack of information on long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 prevents a definitive conclusion on long-term investment prospects.
