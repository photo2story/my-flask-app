## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

American Tower Corp (AMT), a global real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period.  The cumulative return for AMT is 28.98%, while the S&P 500's is 112.74%. This represents a difference of -83.8%, placing it at the 2.8th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (based on the provided -88.9% to +91.0% range).  The consistently low or negative Alpha values in the provided data suggest underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The Beta values near 0 are unusual and likely inaccurate, potentially indicating an issue with the calculation or data used.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $178.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $177.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $182.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $198.36

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates a recent period of consolidation or slight decline.  The larger gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving average further emphasizes a longer term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.66 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.05 (Slightly positive, suggesting weak bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Divergence (20-day):** +2.1 (Short-term upward trend, but weak)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -378.9% (This extremely negative figure is highly unusual and likely reflects an error in the calculation or input data.  It should be investigated and verified.)

The current price of $178.80, being below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, does not indicate any significant rapid upward or downward movement. The low RSI suggests a potentially oversold condition, which could signal a price rebound. However, the weak PPO and the negative expected return (assuming it's accurate) cast doubt on the sustainability of any potential rally.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-29 | -1.7   | $0.19 B      |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.93   | $0.20 B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.97   | $0.18 B      |
| 2023-10-26 | 1.26   | $0.19 B      |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.26   | $0.19 B      | *(Note: Duplicate entry - potential data error)*


There's a significant drop in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024, raising concerns about profitability.  The duplicate entry for October 29th, 2024, indicates potential data inconsistencies that need to be addressed. Revenue remains relatively stable, but the sharp decline in EPS needs further investigation.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $2.52B      | 74.16%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.90B      | 71.66%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.83B      | 72.19%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.79B      | 70.88%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.52B      | 74.69%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%)      |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $3.64       | -21.76%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.86       | 23.35%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.05       | 22.66%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.20       | 2.02%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $4.53       | 12.95%       |

Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains consistent. Profit margins are high and relatively stable, but the negative ROE in Q3 2024 is alarming and requires further investigation. The overall financial picture is mixed, showing strong profit margins but concerning negative ROE.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMT's recent performance has been disappointing, significantly lagging the S&P 500. While the company maintains high profit margins, the sharp decline in EPS and the negative ROE in the most recent quarter raise serious concerns.  The technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition but lack strong bullish momentum. The provided -378.9% long-term expected return is highly improbable and likely erroneous.  Further investigation into the discrepancies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entries, unusual Beta values, extremely negative expected return) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current situation warrants caution.  A thorough review of the company's filings and a deeper dive into the cause of the Q3 2024 losses is necessary.
