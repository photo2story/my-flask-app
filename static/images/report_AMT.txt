**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMT's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly. While the company shows strong revenue and profit margins, recent earnings and ROE figures exhibit volatility and raise concerns. The significantly negative expected return requires further clarification. The negative EPS in Q4 2024 and the fluctuating ROE are red flags.  Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence, including examining the underlying causes for the negative EPS and volatile ROE, understanding the methodology behind the -197.2% expected return, and analyzing the company's future outlook.  A deep dive into the company's strategic initiatives and competitive landscape is recommended.  The high beta suggests that the market's direction will heavily impact AMT, therefore a broader market outlook must be considered.
