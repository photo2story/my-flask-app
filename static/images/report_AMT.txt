**2. Recent Price Movement:**

AMT's closing price is $219.44.  The last market price was $218.26, a decrease of $0.54 from the previous close. This represents a small, recent dip. Moving averages suggest a downward trend:

* 5-day MA: $215.33
* 20-day MA: $212.35
* 60-day MA: $196.81

The price is currently above all three moving averages, indicating potential short-term support.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Medium Risk) suggests moderate market risk associated with AMT.
* **RSI:** 72.42 indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO:** -0.0816, a negative value suggesting bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength:** The 5.5% increase in the 20-day relative strength indicates recent short-term upward momentum.  This contrasts with the negative PPO, suggesting some conflict in signals.
* **Expected Return:** -66.4% represents a substantial negative expected return. This is likely a significant deviation from standard expectations, warranting further investigation into how this figure was calculated.  Given the current data, a negative expected return versus the S&P 500 over a 2+ year period is highly likely. The large negative value highlights the substantial risk associated with this investment relative to the S&P 500.  The recent price decline of $0.54 does not seem to directly explain this exceptionally low expected return, requiring further clarification on its calculation and assumptions.


**Conclusion:**

AMT's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. While past periods showed impressive growth, the current indicators (negative PPO, high RSI, negative expected return) suggest caution. The high MDDs in the historical data highlight significant risk.  Before investing, further due diligence is crucial, including a thorough review of the methodology behind the -66.4% expected return and a deeper analysis of the underlying fundamentals of the company to determine if the current price reflects a buying opportunity despite the risks.
