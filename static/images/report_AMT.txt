## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Overview:**

American Tower Corporation (AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure globally.

* **Cumulative Return (AMT):** 85.48%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 72.42%
* **Return Difference (AMT - VOO):** 13.06%
* **Relative Divergence:** 40% (indicates AMT's performance is in the higher range relative to its historical performance against VOO)


**1. Performance Analysis (vs. S&P 500):**

AMT has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, exhibiting a 13.06% higher cumulative return.  The relative divergence of 40% suggests that this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical fluctuations against the S&P 500.  However,  the provided data doesn't specify the time period for the cumulative return calculation.  A longer timeframe would provide a more robust assessment.

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods. While some periods show significant alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others demonstrate negative returns or lower alpha, highlighting the volatility inherent in the stock. Noteworthy is the consistent high maximum drawdown (MDD) across periods. High MDD indicates significant risk.  The increasing beta in recent years (2021-2024) suggests increasing market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $217.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $218.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $214.11
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $202.61

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating a recent short-term price decrease. However, it remains above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a longer-term upward trend. The recent price change of -2.1 indicates a small decrease compared to the previous closing price.  This is not a significant drop and does not signal a "sharp decline".


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk) -  Suggests moderate risk associated with the investment.
* **RSI:** 51.77 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.07 (Positive, indicating a potential bullish trend)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +4.2 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -1.7% (Short-term expectation)  This negative short-term expectation might be a reflection of the recent price decline.

The combination of indicators suggests a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook. The recent price drop is minimal and doesn't drastically alter the overall picture.  The positive PPO and upward momentum (relative divergence change) counteract the negative short-term expected return. The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not explicitly provided and would require a more comprehensive analysis incorporating future market projections and AMT's growth prospects.


**Conclusion:**

AMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, although the recent performance shows some volatility and risk. The current indicators suggest a relatively neutral outlook, with potential for future growth. However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with AMT, especially considering its high maximum drawdowns in historical periods.  A thorough assessment of future market conditions and AMT's specific growth strategies is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data is insufficient for a definitive long-term outlook.
