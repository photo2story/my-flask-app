## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

American Tower Corp (AMT), a global real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure, has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly over the measured period.  While showing periods of strong growth, recent performance has been negative, and its current valuation relative to the S&P 500 suggests a potential undervaluation based on relative strength historical data.  However, this needs further investigation.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** AMT showed a cumulative return of 41.95%, while VOO achieved 91.19%.  This represents a significant underperformance of -49.2% relative to the S&P 500. The relative divergence of -49.2% places AMT at the 18.4th percentile of its historical range against VOO (-80.7 to +90.2).

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows varying Alpha and Beta values across different time periods.  While Alpha is mostly positive (indicating outperformance relative to the benchmark), it's inconsistent, often low, and recently turned significantly positive (1.1-1.4).  The Beta (a measure of volatility relative to the market) fluctuates around 1, suggesting a correlation with the overall market but increased risk. The high and inconsistent MDD (Maximum Drawdown) percentages across the periods highlight considerable risk associated with AMT.  The significant negative CAGR (-43% to -60%) between 2020 and 2024 is a particularly concerning trend.  The recent slight improvement in CAGR (-4%) is not yet conclusive. The market cap also fluctuates in the 87B to 127B range.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $214.04
* **Last Market:** $217.57 (a $2 increase from the previous close)
* **Moving Averages:** 5-day: $212.52, 20-day: $210.83, 60-day: $195.04.  The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. The recent price increase of $2 shows a sign of possible short term positive changes.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283, falls within the "Medium Risk" category.

* **RSI:** 52.9, slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.

* **PPO:** -0.36, indicates a bearish momentum.

* **Relative Strength Divergence:** A -0.4 change in the 20-day relative strength suggests a recent short-term weakening in momentum relative to the market.

* **Expected Return:** -78.7%  This indicates a significant negative projected return, potentially reflecting the recent negative trends and the significant underperformance versus the S&P 500.  The forecast of -78.7% is exceptionally pessimistic and requires further investigation of its basis.  The projection considers a long-term (2+ years) time horizon.


**Overall Assessment:**

AMT's recent performance has been poor relative to the S&P 500. While the company's long-term prospects may remain positive considering its position in the growing communication infrastructure sector, the high risk, volatility, and negative short-to-medium term outlook based on recent trends and the presented projected return raise concerns.  The positive alpha in more recent periods hints at a potential recovery. The increase in the closing price shows a chance of better results.  However, further investigation into the drivers behind the -78.7% expected return and a thorough fundamental analysis of the company's financials and future growth prospects are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests caution.
