**1. Performance Analysis:**

| Metric                  | AMT           | VOO (S&P 500) | Difference | Relative Difference |
|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Cumulative Return (%)   | 70.11          | 66.27          | 3.84        | 33.6%                |


AMT has outperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  While the absolute difference is 3.84%, the relative difference places AMT's performance in the 33.6th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500, indicating a relatively strong performance compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent Alpha and Beta values across different time periods.  While Alpha is generally positive (indicating outperformance relative to the market), it fluctuates significantly. Beta also varies, suggesting fluctuating sensitivity to overall market movements. The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values across multiple periods highlight the potential for significant losses during market downturns.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) illustrates growth over the observed period.  A more consistent and longer-term analysis would be needed to draw more robust conclusions.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $218.01
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $212.29
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $213.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $200.91

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  It's also significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a stronger longer-term upward trend.  The recent price change of $0.1 is minimal and doesn't indicate any significant price movement (neither a rapid increase nor a rapid decrease).


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk) - Suggests a moderate level of risk.
* **RSI:** 58.16 -  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in a neutral territory.
* **PPO:** -0.21 -  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum, indicating that the price is likely to decrease in the near future.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.4% -  Shows a recent weakening relative to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** -6.0% - This suggests that over a long-term horizon (2+ years), the stock is projected to underperform the S&P 500 by 6 percentage points.


**Overall:**

AMT has shown periods of strong outperformance against the S&P 500, but its performance is volatile, evidenced by high MDD values and fluctuating alpha and beta. Current indicators present a mixed picture, with the price showing a short-term upward trend, but technical indicators like PPO and the relative divergence pointing to potential bearish momentum. The negative expected return further suggests caution. A more thorough analysis, including fundamental factors and a longer time horizon, is recommended before making investment decisions.  The provided data alone does not provide a conclusive recommendation for investment.
