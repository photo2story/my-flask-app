**Analysis of Alpha, Beta Table:**

*   **Historical Outperformance:**  The data shows significant outperformance (high Alpha) in earlier periods (2015-2019). The Beta of 1.0 during those periods indicates the stock moved roughly in line with the market during those periods of outperformance.
*   **Recent Underperformance:**  More recently (2020-2025), the Alpha values have turned negative, showing significant underperformance relative to the market. The Beta values are near 0.0, suggesting that the stock's performance is decoupled from the broader market during these periods.
*   **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** The MDD values are high, indicating significant potential losses during downturns.  This suggests higher risk.
*   **Capitalization:** The Capitalization (Cap) indicates the market cap in Billions of dollars.
*   **CAGR:** CAGR represents the Compound Annual Growth Rate

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $211.88
*   **Previous Close:** $209.73
*   **Change:** 1.03 (A small positive change)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 208.178
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 209.096
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 216.237

The stock price is currently above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, which is a short-term bullish signal.  However, it is below the 60-day moving average, suggesting potential resistance at that level. The positive change from the previous close indicates upward momentum. The change of 1.03 isn't drastic enough to immediately flag a " 급반등 (sudden rebound)" or "급하락 (sudden drop)" issue, but it warrants monitoring, especially given recent volatility news.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3377 (Low Risk - within 0.45~0.35 range)
*   **RSI:** 47.89 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.3141 (Positive, indicating a slight upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_3%_Buy 80% of cash (97 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** 2.5% (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -14.4% (Long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500 if investing from the current point)

The MRI suggests a Low-Risk environment. The RSI is neutral. The PPO indicates a slight upward trend. However, the "Hybrid Signal" suggests *caution*, advising a limited purchase with a significant cash reserve. The recent increase in relative deviation is a positive sign, but the overall expected return is negative, suggesting potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. The positive change from the previous close indicates upward momentum.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **[2025-08-21]:** Major business developments, regulatory changes, or market events impacting AMT.
*   **[2025-08-24]:** Analyst discussion of AMT performance in the context of industry and global economics.

The news snippets indicate recent events causing volatility and requiring careful monitoring of the stock.

**5. Overall Analysis & Recommendation**

AMT presents a mixed picture. Historically, it has demonstrated strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but recent performance has lagged significantly, shown by the negative Alpha values in recent periods and the unfavorable relative deviation position. The technical indicators are inconclusive – while the short-term moving averages suggest upward momentum, the stock remains below its 60-day moving average. Furthermore, the significant price movement from the previous closing price underscores the importance of remaining vigilant amidst market fluctuations.

The negative expected return is concerning. The recent news snippets suggesting volatility warrant caution. The "cash_3%_Buy" hybrid signal further reinforces the need for a conservative approach.

**Recommendation:** Due to the negative expected return, recent underperformance, and signs of volatility, a **cautious approach is warranted.** While the recent price action is positive, it's not enough to outweigh the other concerns. Consider carefully monitoring news and market developments before making any significant investment decisions. A small position might be considered, but a significant cash reserve is advisable, as suggested by the Hybrid Signal.
