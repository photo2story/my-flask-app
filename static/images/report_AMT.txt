## American Tower Corporation (AMT) Stock Analysis

**0. Summary Statistics:**

American Tower Corporation (AMT) is a global real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure.  The provided data shows a cumulative return slightly below the S&P 500 over the analyzed period,  with indicators suggesting a potentially undervalued asset, but with some short-term risk.  However, long-term prospects remain relatively positive.

**1. Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (AMT):** 79.85%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** -2.72%  (AMT underperformed VOO by 2.72 percentage points)
* **Relative Divergence:** 26.9% (Indicates AMT's current underperformance is in the lower-middle range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500).


The Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance relative to the market (Beta) and outperformance (Alpha) over different periods.  Noteworthy is the negative return and relatively high beta in recent years (2020-2024), indicating higher market sensitivity during that period.  The market cap has generally increased over time.  More context on the specific time periods covered by the Alpha/Beta data would be helpful for a more thorough interpretation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 210.91
* **Last Market Price:** 223.6 (a slight decrease of 0.19 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 217.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 214.98
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 204.03

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term support, but below the last market price and shows a recent slight downward trend.  The 60-day moving average is significantly below the current price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.31 (Approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential upward movement)
* **PPO:** -0.31 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -11.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.4% (Expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term).

The discrepancy between the last market price and the closing price (-0.19 change) is not significant enough to indicate a dramatic sudden shift (e.g., rapid surge or plunge). The combination of a relatively low RSI, a negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests a bearish short-term outlook. However, the medium risk MRI and the long-term expected return, despite being negative, suggest that a long-term investment might still yield reasonable returns considering the market risk.  The negative expected return simply indicates underperformance relative to the S&P 500, not necessarily a loss.


**Overall:**

While AMT has shown some recent underperformance against the S&P 500, several factors suggest potential future growth.  The lower RSI and approaching oversold territory signal potential for a short-term upward trend. The long-term outlook, although showing a slightly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500,  should be considered in the context of risk tolerance and diversification.  A more comprehensive analysis would require examining additional factors like financial statements, future growth projections, and industry trends.
