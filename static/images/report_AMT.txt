**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMT's cumulative return of 42.86% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.07% over the analyzed period. The difference is -79.2%, placing it at the 6th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR data shows significant variability in performance year-over-year, with periods of strong growth followed by substantial declines.  The consistently low or zero alpha suggests the stock's performance has largely tracked the market, with little outperformance.  The high beta (ranging from 57 to 95) indicates a higher sensitivity to market fluctuations than the overall market.

The current price of $199.62, being below the moving averages, doesn't suggest a dramatic recent surge or crash. The modest positive PPO, and the RSI near neutral, indicate a neutral to mildly bullish short-term bias, but the longer-term underperformance relative to the market must be considered.
