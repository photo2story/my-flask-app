## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Analysis

**0. Summary Statistics:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) is a global real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure.  The provided data shows AMT has outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, although recent performance has lagged.  Further analysis is required to determine future prospects.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** AMT (81.33%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (78.93%) over the entire period considered.  The difference is 2.4%, placing it at the 31.1 percentile of historical performance relative to its maximum and minimum divergence from the S&P 500.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The table shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  While alpha is generally positive, indicating outperformance, it's inconsistent and relatively small. Beta values fluctuate, mostly around 0.3, suggesting moderately lower volatility than the S&P 500 but with higher periods (0.7) in recent years.  Cap (market capitalization) shows considerable growth over the period.  The negative CAGR in recent years requires further investigation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $212.60
* **Day Change:** -$3.79 (a decrease of 1.71%) which is significant enough to note a potential short-term downward trend.
* **5-day Moving Average:** $218.44
* **20-day Moving Average:** $214.85
* **60-day Moving Average:** $203.60

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish short-term trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates some short-term price instability.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174. This falls within the "Medium Risk" category.

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 47.46.  This is approaching the oversold territory (below 30), suggesting potential for a price rebound, but not a strong signal.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.11.  A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.5%. A negative value signifies a recent decrease in relative performance compared to the benchmark.

* **Expected Return:** -2.7%. This indicates a potential short-term loss but does not account for long-term growth potential.

* **Long-term (2+ years) Expected Return vs. S&P 500:**  The provided data does not give a specific figure for long-term outperformance.  Given the historical outperformance and medium risk assessment, further fundamental and technical analysis is needed to determine this. The negative CAGR over the past few years cautions against assuming continued historical outperformance.



**Overall Assessment:**

While AMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, recent performance is weaker. The negative day change, position below moving averages, and negative PPO indicate a bearish short-term trend.  However, the relatively low RSI and medium risk assessment suggest potential for a price rebound.  A thorough evaluation of fundamental factors, such as earnings reports, industry trends, and overall economic outlook, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The historical data suggests long-term potential, but recent performance warrants closer examination.  The long-term outlook against the S&P 500 remains uncertain based on the provided data alone.
