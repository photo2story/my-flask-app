## American Tower Corporation (AMT) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Summary:**

American Tower Corporation (AMT) is a global real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communication infrastructure.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. However, recent performance indicates a potential downward trend, requiring further investigation.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **AMT Cumulative Return:** 67.81%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 66.94%
* **Return Difference:** 0.87%  (AMT outperformed VOO by 0.87 percentage points at the end of the period).
* **Relative Divergence:** 31.1% (This indicates that AMT's performance relative to VOO is above average based on historical data).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values over different time periods.  Generally, the alpha is positive (though not always significant) indicating outperformance against the benchmark. Beta is mostly around 1, suggesting a level of market sensitivity similar to the S&P 500.  However, the relatively high beta value in the last two years (2021-2023 & 2022-2024) signals higher volatility than the market average. The significant negative CAGR in the 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 periods highlights periods of underperformance, potentially due to market-specific factors. Market cap has increased over time.  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) remain consistently high, pointing to the potential for significant price drops.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $207.48
* **5-day Moving Average:** $214.78
* **20-day Moving Average:** $214.06
* **60-day Moving Average:** $200.52

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short-to-medium term.  The recent price increase of $1.38 (from $204.66) is not significant enough to overcome this downward trend indicated by moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.53 (High Risk)  This indicates a higher level of market uncertainty.
* **RSI:** 44.02 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.79 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -6.1% (This is the expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term).

The combination of a high MRI, negative PPO, and below-average moving averages signals caution.  Although the RSI is nearing oversold territory, itâ€™s not a definitive buy signal on its own.  The relatively small recent price change does not indicate any significant price volatility (neither a sharp rise nor fall). The projected negative expected return further strengthens the cautious outlook.  


**Conclusion:**

While AMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, current indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  The negative expected return and high market risk warrant caution. Investors should carefully consider the high MDDs evident in the past and the potentially high volatility before making investment decisions.  Further research into the specific factors affecting AMT's recent performance is crucial before taking any action.
