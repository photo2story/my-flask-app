**Company Overview:** American Tower Corporation is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communication infrastructure globally.


**Performance Analysis:**

AMT significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of 48.01% compared to VOO's 116.17%.  The -68.2% difference highlights this substantial underperformance. While the relative divergence of 11.5% suggests this underperformance isn't an extreme outlier compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500, it still indicates a significant lag.

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance across different periods. While several years show strong growth (e.g., 89% CAGR from 2017-2019), recent years (2022-2025) demonstrate significant negative returns.  The Alpha values generally hover around 0.2, suggesting minimal outperformance relative to the market (Beta), with a slight increase in more recent periods.  The consistently high Beta values (mostly above 0.5) indicate AMT's price movements are highly correlated with the overall market, thus being significantly impacted by market fluctuations.  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) are considerable in recent years, highlighting significant price drops during market corrections.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) over time reflects the company's growth before the recent decline.

**Recent Price Movements:**

* **Current Price:** $209.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $201.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $192.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $189.54

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The jump from the previous close ($205.62) to the current price ($209.13) indicates a short-term upward price movement.

**Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (73.65):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally above 70), suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.88):**  Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (6.8, +):** Short-term upward trend, consistent with the moving average data.


**Expected Return and Conclusion:**

The provided expected return of -110.1% is extremely negative and requires further clarification.  This value likely represents a projection relative to the S&P 500 over a longer timeframe, and  the negative sign suggests that the model expects AMT to underperform the S&P500 significantly over the next two years.  The large magnitude warrants a careful review of the underlying assumptions and methodology used to generate this estimate.

In summary, while AMT has shown periods of strong growth, its recent performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500.  High beta, recent negative CAGR, and an RSI nearing overbought levels suggest caution. The dramatically negative expected return needs further investigation before making investment decisions.  Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with AMT's high volatility and market correlation before making any long-term investment decisions.
