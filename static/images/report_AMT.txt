* Last Price: 196.88 (Last Market: 197.35)
* 5-Day Moving Average: 197.27

* RSI: 21.21
* PPO: -0.9
* Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence: -6.65 
* Expected Return: 0.0% (over a 2+ year horizon)

The low RSI value and negative PPO suggest oversold conditions, potentially indicating a near-term rebound. The recent negative relative divergence (-6.65) indicates a short-term downward trend.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMT currently faces significant challenges. The recent earnings miss has cast a shadow over the company's future performance, and the stock price is lagging behind the market.
