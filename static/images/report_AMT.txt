**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) is a global real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communication infrastructure.  The following analysis uses provided data to assess AMT's performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **AMT Cumulative Return:** 76.45%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 87.98%
* **Return Difference:** -11.53%  (AMT underperformed VOO by 11.53 percentage points at the end of the period).

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $209.75

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term pullback within a longer-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.09 (Approaching oversold territory; below 50)

* **Recent Relative Strength Divergence:** -5.9% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -7.6% over the long term (2+ years). *This implies that AMT is expected to underperform the S&P 500 by 7.6% over a long investment period*.


**Conclusion:**

AMT's performance has been inconsistent relative to the S&P 500. While showing periods of strong outperformance, recent performance has lagged.  Technical indicators suggest a relatively weak short-term outlook, but the long-term outlook is less clear.  The -7.6% expected return compared to the S&P 500 should be interpreted carefully considering the considerable risk, as indicated by the volatile beta and negative long-term alpha in the provided data. A more comprehensive analysis, including fundamental factors and broader market conditions, is needed before making any investment decision.  The provided data span is insufficient to assess long-term performance reliably.
