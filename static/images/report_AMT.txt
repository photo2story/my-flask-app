**Conclusion:**

AMT currently shows signs of a short-term downtrend. While historical data suggests periods of outperformance relative to the S&P 500,  recent performance has been weaker.  The high maximum drawdown highlights the inherent risk.  The RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, but further analysis is needed before making any investment decisions. The negative expected return in the short term warrants caution.  A long-term perspective (2+ years) should consider careful risk management due to the observed volatility.
