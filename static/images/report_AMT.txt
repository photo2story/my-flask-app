## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure.  While recent performance has lagged,  long-term projections suggest potential outperformance relative to the S&P 500.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** AMT's cumulative return is 80.47%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) 71.02% return. The difference is 9.45%, placing it in the 43.9th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range (-47.2% to 82.0%).


* **Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows mixed results. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been strong in some periods (e.g., 2017-2019 at 79%), other periods show negative returns (-10% in 2020-2022 and -8% in 2021-2023). Alpha, which measures excess return over the market, is generally positive, indicating that AMT has historically outperformed the benchmark. However, Beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, has increased recently suggesting higher risk.  Market capitalization has generally increased over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $220.17
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $220.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $214.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $198.92

The stock price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential longer-term upward trend.  The recent price change of -$3.51 (-1.54%) from the previous close shows a minor downward movement.  This movement doesn't qualify as a sharp drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693, suggesting a high-risk level.
* **RSI:** 58.85, indicating the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO:** 0.12, a positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** 12.1%, indicating a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -12.7%. This negative expected return is likely short-term based on recent market actions.  The long-term (2+ years) potential for outperformance of the S&P 500 remains, although the degree of outperformance depends on several factors not included in this analysis (market conditions, company-specific news, etc.).


**Conclusion:**

AMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, as evidenced by its higher cumulative return and generally positive alpha values. However, recent performance has been weak, and several indicators suggest high risk.  The short-term outlook appears mixed, while the long-term potential for outperformance remains, though the magnitude is uncertain.  Investors should consider the current market risk and carefully weigh the potential for long-term gains against the associated volatility.  Further analysis is needed to form a fully-informed investment decision.
