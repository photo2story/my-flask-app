## American Tower Corporation (AMT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure.

The provided data shows AMT's cumulative return at 37.34%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 118.37%.  The difference is -81.0%, placing it at the 4.4th percentile of the historical range of divergence between AMT and the S&P 500. This indicates AMT has substantially underperformed the market benchmark.  The provided CAGR data, however, shows significant variability year-over-year, with several years demonstrating substantial outperformance.  The most recent years, however, show considerable underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $190.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $183.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $181.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $196.60

The closing price is above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium term.  The recent price increase of $0.17 (0.09%) is relatively small and does not signal a significant change.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 61.15 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.98 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -243.4% (This indicates a significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  The magnitude of this number requires scrutiny and may warrant further investigation into the methodology used for calculation.)

The positive PPO and relatively small recent price change, alongside the positive 20-day relative divergence change suggest a modestly positive short-term outlook. However, the significantly negative expected return raises serious concerns about the long-term viability of AMT compared to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in EPS.  There's a notable decline in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024. While revenue generally remains relatively consistent, the fluctuating EPS warrants further investigation into the underlying causes. The repetition of the 2024-10-29 data point suggests an error in the data provided.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals generally stable revenue, albeit with some minor fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high, ranging from 70.88% to 74.69%, which is a positive sign. However, the ROE shows significant variability, with negative ROE in Q3 2024, indicating potential challenges in profitability.  Further investigation into the causes of this negative ROE is warranted.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMT's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 recently, despite historically showing periods of outperformance.  While short-term technical indicators suggest some positive momentum, the long-term expected return is extremely negative compared to the benchmark.  The financial statements show strong profit margins but fluctuating ROE, and the earnings data exhibits volatility in EPS.  The inconsistent performance, along with the negative long-term expected return, raise significant concerns about the investment prospects of AMT relative to broader market indices.  Further investigation into the drivers of the negative expected return, the inconsistent ROE, and the volatility in EPS is essential before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistencies and potential errors in the data provided also necessitate verifying the accuracy of the source data.
