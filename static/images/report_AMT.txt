    *   **CAGR:**  Shows strong historical growth in some periods (2015-2019), but significant negative growth recently.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses from peak to trough. MDD has remained high in recent years (around 80%), indicating increased volatility.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the performance of an investment compared to a benchmark index. From 2015 to 2019, AMT generated positive alpha, indicating it outperformed its benchmark. More recently, however, Alpha has been significantly negative, implying underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Beta indicates the volatility of a stock relative to the market. AMT's Beta has increased over time. The recent Betas (0.7 to 1.3) suggest that AMT's price movements are increasingly correlated with, and even more volatile than, the market.
    *   **Cap (B):** This represents the company's market capitalization in billions. It shows growth in earlier periods, but some decline in recent years, reflecting the negative returns.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   Close: 176.41
*   Last-market: Price: 176.41, Previous Close: 174.8, Change: 0.92
*   5-day SMA: 174.13
*   20-day SMA: 177.79
*   60-day SMA: 182.29

*   **Analysis:** The current price (176.41) is above the 5-day SMA (174.13), suggesting a recent short-term upward trend. However, it's below both the 20-day SMA (177.79) and the 60-day SMA (182.29), indicating that the medium- and longer-term trends are still downward. The last market change shows a positive change, indicating a slight rebound.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   MRI (Market Risk Indicator): 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   RSI (Relative Strength Index): 44.85
*   PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator): -0.11
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -1.4 (Indicates a short-term decline)
*   Expected Return (%): -3955.8%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A value of 1.0 suggests a high investment recommendation, although this should be considered cautiously in light of other indicators.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 44.85 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A PPO of -0.11 suggests a slightly bearish trend, as the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The 'Buy 100% of cash' signal suggests a bullish outlook based on the model's calculations, but the low MRI score indicates that it is a 'Very Safe' investment decision.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:**  The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent short-term decline.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-3955.8%) is a major red flag. It strongly suggests that, based on the model, the stock is significantly overvalued or faces major headwinds that are expected to negatively impact its future performance over the long term.

The extremely negative expected return is a particularly concerning signal that warrants further investigation. Weigh the potential upside from the dividend and analyst target prices against the downside risks highlighted by the other indicators and recent news. It's possible the analyst opinions haven't fully factored in the risks flagged by the model's calculations and negative news.
