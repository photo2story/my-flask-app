**Analysis of the Table:**  The data shows significant variation in AMT's performance over time.  While the CAGR has been generally positive, there are periods of significant negative returns (MDD). Alpha is highly variable, indicating periods of both significant outperformance and underperformance compared to the market.  Beta is generally low, suggesting that AMT's price movements are less volatile than the overall market.  Market capitalization has increased substantially over the period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $220.17
* **Previous Close:** $228.19
* **Change:** -$3.51 (a decrease of ~1.54%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $220.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $214.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $198.92

The price is currently below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it is above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a longer-term uptrend.  The recent price drop is notable.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)  This indicates a relatively high level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 58.85 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.12 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +12.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -12.7% (This is likely a short-term projection given the recent price drop. Long-term expected return needs a different analytical framework)

The recent price drop of $3.51 suggests a potential short-term negative trend.  The high MRI value supports this, indicating elevated market risk. However, the positive PPO and slightly above-neutral RSI values suggest that the downtrend might be temporary.

The -12.7% expected return likely reflects the recent price decline.  A long-term (2+ years) investment outlook requires a more sophisticated analysis incorporating factors beyond short-term price movements and considering the historical Alpha values to assess the potential for exceeding S&P 500 returns.  The historical data suggests that while AMT can significantly outperform the market in certain periods, it is also prone to substantial drawdowns.
