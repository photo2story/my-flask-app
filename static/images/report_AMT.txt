## American Tower Corporation (AMT) Stock Report

**0. Overview:**

American Tower Corporation is a global real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMT's cumulative return is 38.21%, significantly lower than the S&P 500's cumulative return of 117.28%.  The difference is -79.1%, placing it at the 5.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range. This indicates AMT has underperformed the S&P 500 considerably over the measured period.


The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Alpha/Beta data show inconsistent performance over different time periods. While periods like 2017-2019 exhibit strong growth and positive alpha (outperformance), recent periods (2022-2025) show significant negative returns and high negative CAGR, suggesting considerable volatility and underperformance against the market (reflected in the negative alpha).  The beta consistently above 1 indicates higher volatility than the overall market. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has fluctuated in the $85B - $125B range during this period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $192.0
* **5-day moving average:** $190.81
* **20-day moving average:** $188.76
* **60-day moving average:** $189.75

The price is slightly above all three moving averages, suggesting a mildly bullish short-term trend.  The recent price change of +0.23% from the previous close indicates minimal daily movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 64.05 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in a neutral territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.22 – A positive value indicates a bullish signal.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 3.5 (+) – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend in relative strength.


The provided expected return of -248% is extremely negative and highly improbable. This value needs further clarification or verification as it's unrealistic for a long-term investment.  The provided data does not support such a prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-29 | -1.7 | $0.19 B       |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.93 | $0.20 B       |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.97 | $0.18 B       |
| 2023-10-26 | 1.26 | $0.19 B       |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.26 | $0.19 B       |

There's a discrepancy in the October 29th data.  Earnings show significant volatility, with a large negative EPS in the most recent quarter.  Revenue remains relatively stable but low.  This volatile earnings performance contributes to the overall negative outlook.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $2.52B    | 74.16%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.90B    | 71.66%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.83B    | 72.19%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.79B    | 70.88%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.52B    | 74.69%        |

Revenue is relatively stable, with minor fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high, which is positive.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity    | ROE          |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $3.64B    | -21.76%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.86B    | 23.35%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.05B    | 22.66%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.20B    | 2.02%         |
| 2023-09-30 | $4.53B    | 12.95%        |

Equity is decreasing, and ROE (Return on Equity) is highly volatile, showing both strongly positive and strongly negative values. This volatility is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While high profit margins are a positive indicator, recent negative EPS, declining equity, volatile ROE, and a significantly negative (and likely erroneous) projected long-term return raise significant concerns.  The high beta indicates substantial market risk.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the recent poor performance and the highly negative expected return figure.  The provided data suggests a bearish outlook, though a deeper dive into the fundamental drivers of the negative EPS and the reasons for the dramatic swings in ROE is necessary before making a conclusive assessment.
