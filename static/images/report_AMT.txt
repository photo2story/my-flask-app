*   **Beta:** Beta measures volatility relative to the market.  The beta has increased in recent years.  A beta above 1 indicates the stock is more volatile than the S&P 500. This, combined with negative alpha, is a concerning trend.

*   **60-day SMA:** 186.9518

**Analysis:** AMT is trading below all its Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This suggests a downtrend, as the short-term averages are below the longer-term averages.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - This is contradictory to other indicators and should be interpreted with extreme caution. It's essential to understand the MRI methodology.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.28 (Below 50, slightly bearish, not yet oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.0847 (close to zero, not much volatility)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash, but very safe (MRI: 0.9). Contradictory with Expected Return of -2067.0
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -4.7 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2067.0 (Extremely negative – significant underperformance expected compared to S&P 500 over the long term)

**Analysis:** The indicators present a mixed picture. The RSI is slightly bearish.  The high MRI contrasts sharply with the extremely negative expected return, the high beta, the negative alpha, and the negative divergence, suggesting the MRI is potentially flawed or that other significant negative factors are at play. The Hybrid signal of "Buy" despite very high market risk should be investigated carefully.
