**1) Performance Analysis:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure.  Over the analyzed period, AMT significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return of 45.16% compared to VOO's 89.44%. This represents a difference of -44.3%.  While the relative divergence of 21.3% suggests that this underperformance is not entirely unprecedented within the historical context of AMT's performance relative to VOO, it still represents a considerable shortfall.

The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta data reveal inconsistent performance over time. While periods of strong growth (e.g., 2017-2019 with 77% CAGR) are evident, more recent years (2022-2024) show significant negative returns and high negative alpha, suggesting underperformance relative to the market during those periods.  The high Beta values in recent years indicate increased sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The market cap fluctuates in a broad range of 85.7B to 124.6B.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of AMT is $219.44.  The price shows a recent upward trend, trading above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages. This suggests some short-term buying pressure. However, the relatively small increase of $0.85 (from $217.60)  does not indicate a dramatic price jump.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 72.42 suggests that AMT is approaching overbought territory, potentially indicating a short-term price correction may be due.  The negative PPO (-0.08) confirms bearish momentum.  The recent positive relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend; however, this is contrasted by the negative long-term expected return (-66.4%).  The medium risk level (MRI = 0.4382) should be considered in investment decisions.  The negative long-term expected return (-66.4%) relative to the S&P 500 warrants careful consideration before initiating a long-term investment strategy.  A more detailed analysis of the underlying factors contributing to this negative outlook is necessary for a complete assessment.
