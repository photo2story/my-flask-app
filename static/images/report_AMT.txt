No specific news or market outlook within the past two days relating to earnings is provided.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.

**7) Overall Analysis:**

AMT's recent performance is concerning.  While historical profitability has been strong, the significant drop in EPS and negative ROE in the latest quarter raise significant questions about the company's current financial health. The lack of consistent revenue growth and the volatility in key financial metrics (ROE) highlight potential risks.  Further investigation is needed to understand the causes behind the latest quarterly results, including a comparison with market expectations and analysis of any external factors impacting performance. The sustained underperformance against the S&P 500 further underscores the need for a more thorough analysis.  The provided data alone is insufficient for a comprehensive investment decision. More information is needed regarding the reasons for the recent drop in EPS and whether this is a temporary setback or a more significant trend.

**8) Note:**  This analysis is limited by the scope of the provided data.  A complete investment decision should include broader research, considering factors such as market conditions, competitive landscape, and long-term growth prospects.  The absence of information regarding earnings expectations and recent news limits the depth of this analysis.
