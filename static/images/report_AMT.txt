**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large divergence in returns. Recent stock performance indicates a downward trend, with negative values in recent periods. The RSI suggests the stock is oversold, presenting a potential short-term buying opportunity, though this is contradicted by a large, very negative, expected return.

The news headlines are mixed. Downgrades and institutional selling are negative signals, but some analysis suggests potential upside. Analyst opinions are also mixed. The consensus is a "Buy" and the target price is above current market price. The lack of recent data for analyst ratings changes makes it difficult to assess.

**Overall, the analysis paints a complex picture. The company has struggled recently, and the negative expected return is a major red flag. However, the oversold condition, the "Buy" rating from analysts, and the potential upside mentioned in some news articles suggest that a turnaround might be possible. However, a decision to invest requires further extensive research due to the amount of negative factors currently displayed.**
