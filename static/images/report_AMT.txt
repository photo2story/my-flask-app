*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    *   **Trend:** Alpha has generally been negative in recent years, indicating underperformance compared to the market. Beta fluctuates, generally below 1, suggesting lower volatility than the market, but potentially lower participation in market gains. The sharp shifts in alpha indicate substantial period-specific performance changes.

**3. Technical and Sentiment Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** An MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium investment recommendation based on market risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 29.30 indicates that AMT is currently in oversold territory, which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity as it might be due for a bounce.
*   **PPO:** The PPO of 0.0305 is a positive value, suggesting the shorter-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal suggests allocating 100% of cash to buy 6 shares, based on an "Oversold Boost" signal and a medium MRI. It also suggests a small monthly investment.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** A recent (20-day) relative divergence change of 2.1 (+) indicates a short-term increase, suggesting a possible short-term rebound.
