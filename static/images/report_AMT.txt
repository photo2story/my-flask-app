**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is a significant limitation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, showing a large negative return difference. While some historical periods showed strong growth, recent performance has been weak, indicated by negative CAGR and high MDD. Technical indicators suggest a weak, potentially bearish trend.  The recent earnings show volatility and a concerning drop in Q4 2024 EPS. The lack of complete financial data hinders a thorough evaluation. The extremely negative expected return figure needs clarification.  Before making any investment decisions,  more comprehensive financial information, clarification on the expected return calculation, and a longer-term analysis are strongly recommended. The high beta indicates considerable risk.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider this risk profile and the potential for continued underperformance relative to the broader market.
