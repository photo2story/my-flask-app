American Tower Corporation is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure globally.

The cumulative return of AMT (33.41%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) (119.91%) over the period considered.  The -86.5% difference highlights substantial underperformance.

The fluctuating alpha values suggest inconsistent outperformance relative to the market. The negative CAGR values in recent years (2022-2025) are particularly concerning.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 39.0% | 9.4% | 10.0% | -0.0 | 56.2 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. It is slightly above its 20-day moving average, indicating some short-term support.  The recent price drop (-$0.47) shows a slight negative movement.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (63.40):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning towards the upper neutral zone.
* **PPO (0.41):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+1.2):** Indicates short-term upward momentum.

The -949.3% expected return is implausibly low and needs clarification or correction.  The data source for this figure should be reviewed.

The earnings data shows volatility, with a recent loss in the October 2024 quarter.  Further analysis is needed to determine the cause of this loss. There appears to be a duplicate entry for October 29, 2024.  Consistent and reliable data is crucial for accurate analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years.  The high beta indicates substantial market sensitivity.  While some technical indicators suggest short-term bullishness, the recent earnings volatility and highly fluctuating ROE are significant concerns.  The extremely negative long-term expected return (-949.3%) needs to be verified.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence is crucial, including investigating the source and validity of the -949.3% expected return figure and carefully examining the reasons for the significant recent losses and volatility in both earnings and ROE.  This analysis suggests AMT is a high-risk investment at the current time.
