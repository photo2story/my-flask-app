**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** -0.68 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -13.6% (Short-term downtrend).

**Conclusion:**

AMT has shown periods of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in earlier years, but more recently has underperformed with higher market sensitivity (beta). Current technical indicators present a mixed picture: although the price has shown a recent sharp increase, other metrics (PPO, expected return) point toward bearishness. The high MRI score suggests caution.  A long-term investment requires careful consideration of the market risk and recent underperformance relative to the market. Further fundamental analysis is advised to complement this technical analysis.
