Given the recent underperformance, negative trends, and cautious Hybrid Signal, a **neutral to slightly negative** outlook is warranted. Investors should exercise caution and conduct further due diligence, paying close attention to the company's upcoming news and announcements, before making investment decisions. The long-term expected return is attractive, but the current risks and challenges are significant. It's important to understand what's driving the difference between the recent performance and the projected long-term outperformance. A deeper dive into the underlying reasons for the negative alpha is crucial.
