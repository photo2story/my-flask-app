Here's an analysis of American Tower Corp (AMT) based on the provided data, presented as a report.

**American Tower Corp (AMT) Investment Report**

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

American Tower Corp (AMT) is a global real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast infrastructure.  Over the given period, AMT's cumulative return is 37.00%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 120.36%. The provided data shows a significant divergence of -83.4%, placing it at the 3.1 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided Alpha of 0.0 across all periods suggests that AMT's returns are largely explained by its market beta (high Beta of 89.0 suggests high market sensitivity).  The CAGR fluctuates significantly, highlighting the volatility in returns and the risk associated with this stock.  The Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) shown indicate substantial periods of losses, particularly in recent years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $189.93
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $185.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $181.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $196.11

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The price is relatively close to the 5 and 20-day moving averages, indicating potential short-term support, but the distance from the 60-day moving average points to a longer-term bearish trend.  The recent daily price change (-$0.24) suggests a minor downward move.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 61.20. This indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.12.  A positive PPO suggests upward momentum, though the magnitude is modest.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8.  This shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -356.2%. This extremely negative figure suggests a significant underperformance expectation compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. This result should be treated with extreme caution, as the model predicting this outcome is not specified and this projection is exceptionally low.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals significant volatility.  EPS has fluctuated significantly, showing both positive and negative results across reported quarters. Revenue has remained relatively stable in the $0.18B-$0.20B range, but consistent profit is not evident. The significant drop in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 is particularly concerning, warranting further investigation. Duplicated data for Q3 2024 should be rectified.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue is relatively stable and robust, consistently above $2.5B. Profit margins are high, consistently above 70%, demonstrating strong operational efficiency.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally decreased, showing a declining trend.  Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates considerably, with both positive and very negative figures, demonstrating considerable volatility in profitability and potentially indicating unsustainable levels of profit generation. The significant negative ROE in Q3 2024 raises serious concern.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the specified period. While revenue and profit margins are consistently high, recent earnings show erratic EPS and a worrying downward trend in ROE.  The predicted long-term underperformance of -356.2% relative to the S&P 500 is extremely negative and needs critical re-evaluation of the model used.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture.  The high beta highlights significant market sensitivity, meaning any market downturn will heavily impact AMT's price.  Investors should proceed with caution, conducting thorough due diligence before considering an investment, particularly given the alarming recent financial performance.  The high volatility of both earnings and returns makes this a very risky investment.
