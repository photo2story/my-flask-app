## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Performance Review

**Executive Summary:** American Tower Corp (AMT), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period. While showing periods of strong growth, recent performance has been negative, leading to a substantial lag behind the market benchmark.  Technical indicators suggest overbought conditions, warranting caution.  Long-term prospects are uncertain given the predicted negative alpha.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Returns:** AMT's cumulative return is 52.39%, significantly lower than the S&P 500's 108.62%. This represents a difference of -56.2%, placing it at the 18.2nd percentile of historical relative performance against the S&P 500 (based on provided min/max range).

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided table shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different time periods. While some periods demonstrate positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), suggesting periods of strong stock-specific performance, the recent years (2022-2025) display negative returns and high beta, indicating high volatility and market sensitivity, despite positive alpha values.  The negative CAGR of -54% (2022-2024) and -9% (2023-2025) are deeply concerning, particularly in light of the predicted long-term negative expected return.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 39.0% | 9.4% | 10.0% | 56.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 45.0% | 9.4% | 27.0% | 63.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 89.0% | 5.3% | 59.0% | 94.2 |
| 2018-2020  | 36.0% | 4.2% | 9.0% | 93.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 62.0% | 8.3% | -9.0% | 124.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -41.0% | 15.0% | -50.0% | 92.6 |
| 2021-2023  | -22.0% | 15.0% | -45.0% | 97.6 |
| 2022-2024  | -54.0% | 15.0% | -87.0% | 85.7 |
| 2023-2025  | -9.0% | 11.9% | -58.0% | 99.2 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $212.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $208.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $197.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $189.79

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, the relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day averages suggests the upward momentum might be weakening.  The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a recent sharp price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (77.88):**  Indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (0.71):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but the high RSI value suggests this might be unsustainable.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+6.7):** Shows a recent increase in relative strength, aligning with the short-term uptrend.
* **Expected Return (-65.7%):** This signifies a projected significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This dramatically contradicts the alpha figures presented and raises concerns about the accuracy or relevance of the expected return calculation. Further investigation into its methodology is needed.
* **Price Change:** The recent price increase of $2.59 (1.25% from the previous close) suggests a potential short-term upward swing, although not exceptionally dramatic.


**Conclusion:**

AMT has underperformed the S&P 500 over the reviewed period. While past periods showed strong growth, the recent negative performance, coupled with overbought technical indicators and a predicted long-term negative expected return relative to the S&P 500, raises significant concerns.  The discrepancy between the historical alpha and predicted negative expected return requires further scrutiny.  Investors should exercise caution and carefully consider the risks before making any investment decisions.  The high beta further emphasizes the volatility of this investment, which could benefit significantly during periods of rapid growth but be deeply affected during market corrections.
