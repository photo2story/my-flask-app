## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Summary:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period. However, recent performance has been lagging, indicated by negative CAGR and negative expected returns.  Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying causes.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **AMT Cumulative Return:** 70.21%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 66.69%
* **Return Difference:** 3.52% (AMT outperformed VOO by 3.52 percentage points)
* **Relative Divergence:** 33.2% (Indicates AMT's performance is in the upper 33.2% percentile relative to its historical performance against the VOO, based on a range of -35.3% to 81.5%.)

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values over different time periods.  While positive alpha values (particularly 9.0%, 20.0%, and 50.0% in 2015-2017, 2016-2018, and 2017-2019 respectively) indicate outperformance relative to the market, recent years (2022-2024) show negative CAGR and high beta (0.7), suggesting higher volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The increase in beta also points to an increase in market risk. The Market Cap (Cap(B)) shows a generally increasing trend, indicating growth in company size.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, suggesting significant potential for short-term losses.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $217.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $209.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $212.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $200.43

The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  However, the relatively small difference between the current price and the 20-day and 5-day moving averages suggests caution. The significant gap between the 60-day moving average and current price indicates a notable price increase in the past month.  The recent price change of +2.14 reflects a small upward jump. While not necessarily "rapid", it is noteworthy given the context of recent negative trends.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High risk category)  This indicator signals that the overall market conditions are considered high risk.
* **RSI:** 58.37 (Neither overbought nor oversold) The RSI indicates a relatively neutral market sentiment.
* **PPO:** -0.40 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum) The negative PPO suggests a downward momentum in the stock.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -10.9% (Short-term downward trend) This reflects a recent decrease in the stock's relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** -5.6% (Negative, suggesting potential for losses)  This negative expected return suggests potential for losses over the long term, relative to the S&P 500.

**Overall Assessment:**

While AMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, recent performance indicators paint a less optimistic picture. The high market risk indicator, negative PPO, negative expected return, and increasing beta suggest caution. The recent price increase, although small, should be viewed within the context of these negative indicators.  A comprehensive analysis that includes other fundamental and qualitative factors is recommended before making investment decisions. The high MDD throughout the observed periods further emphasizes the substantial risk inherent in investing in AMT.
