## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes American Tower Corp (AMT), a global owner and operator of communications real estate, focusing on its recent performance and financial health.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AMT's cumulative return (37.88%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.31%. The provided divergence analysis shows AMT is currently 80.4% below the S&P 500, placing it at the 4.7th percentile of its historical range (relative to the S&P 500).  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the market.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a complex picture. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been high in some periods (reaching 89% between 2017-2019), recent years (2022-2025) show significant negative returns.  The Beta fluctuates, generally indicating a high sensitivity to market movements, but with a notable spike in the most recent period (2021-2023 and 2022-2024). This suggests high market volatility is a significant factor.  The fluctuating alpha values imply that, while the company sometimes outperforms the market, the outperformance is not consistent.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $191.55
* **Previous Close:** $192.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $190.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $188.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $189.92

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting some recent downward pressure.  The price is above the 20-day moving average, however. The recent price movement suggests a relatively stable trend, but the recent close indicates a minor downward correction (-$0.83).

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 64.01 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.22 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -285.4% (This extremely negative value requires further investigation and clarification of the calculation method. It is likely an error or using a highly pessimistic scenario.)

The technical indicators suggest a moderately bullish sentiment, although the recent price decline warrants caution. The extremely negative expected return requires further analysis and context.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While there were positive EPS figures in Q1 2024 and Q2 2024, Q3 2024 shows a significant drop to -$1.7.  Revenue has remained relatively consistent, fluctuating around $0.19-$0.20B.  Note the duplication of the 2024-10-29 entry in the table. This inconsistency needs clarification.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-29 | -1.7 | 0.19 B$ |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.93 | 0.20 B$ |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.97 | 0.18 B$ |
| 2023-10-26 | 1.26 | 0.19 B$ |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.26 | 0.19 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals high revenue but significant volatility in profitability. Profit margins are consistently high (70-74%), indicating strong operational efficiency. However, Return on Equity (ROE) is highly volatile, showing periods of strong positive returns and significant negative returns, potentially reflecting the cyclical nature of the telecom infrastructure market. The negative ROE in Q3 2024 is particularly concerning and needs further investigation.

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $2.52B | 74.16% |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.90B | 71.66% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.83B | 72.19% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.79B | 70.88% |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.52B | 74.69% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $3.64B | -21.76% |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.86B | 23.35% |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.05B | 22.66% |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.20B | 2.02% |
| 2023-09-30 | $4.53B | 12.95% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMT's performance has been highly volatile, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 in recent years. While the company exhibits high revenue and profit margins, the recent negative EPS, fluctuating ROE, and inconsistent alpha suggest a need for caution.  The highly negative projected long-term return is likely erroneous and needs clarification.  Further investigation into the Q3 2024 earnings results and the reasons for the large negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high Beta suggests significant market sensitivity; therefore, a thorough analysis of macroeconomic factors influencing the telecom sector is warranted.  Before investing, a detailed review of the company's strategic direction and future growth prospects is recommended.
