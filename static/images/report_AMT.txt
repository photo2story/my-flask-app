The cumulative return of AMT (57.63%) lags behind VOO (130.06%) by -72.4 percentage points.

* **PPO:** 0.9992 – A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (-) – Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided data does not offer a reliable projection of future outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a 2-year period.  Further analysis is needed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows considerable volatility in EPS:

* **EPS Trends:** EPS has fluctuated significantly, with a notable drop to -1.7 in the latest quarter (2024-10-29).  This is a substantial decline from previous quarters, which mostly ranged from 1.26 to 1.97.

* **Revenue Trends:** Revenue remains relatively stable, fluctuating around $0.19B-$0.20B in recent quarters, showcasing a consistent revenue stream. However, a clearer trend cannot be established without further historical data.

* **Notable Beats or Misses:**  There's no information about earnings expectations to assess whether the results beat or missed them.  We can only evaluate the reported figures themselves.  The significant negative EPS in the last quarter is noteworthy and warrants further investigation.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains relatively high. Profit margins are consistently high, exceeding 70% in most quarters.  The slight dip to 74.16% in Q3 2024 compared to the previous quarter deserves attention, but needs a longer time series for proper analysis.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally been decreasing over the past year. ROE has been highly variable, even showing a negative return in the most recent quarter. This negative ROE (-21.76% in Q3 2024) is concerning and needs further investigation into the underlying causes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook information was provided.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing from the input data.  Information from reliable financial news sources would be crucial for a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. While the recent price action shows some short-term upward momentum, the long-term trend appears negative.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture. Recent earnings show a concerning drop in EPS, despite relatively stable revenue.  The negative ROE in the latest quarter is also a major red flag.  The lack of information regarding market outlook and analyst opinions significantly limits the depth of this analysis.   **Further investigation is needed to understand the causes behind the declining EPS and negative ROE, and to gain a better understanding of the overall market sentiment and future outlook for AMT.**  The currently available data is insufficient to confidently recommend a long-term investment.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the volatile earnings, and the concerning negative ROE, a deeper dive into the company's financials, industry trends, and competitive landscape is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  Specifically, investigate the reasons behind the significant drop in EPS and negative ROE in the latest quarter.  Consult reputable financial news sources and analyst reports for a more complete picture.
