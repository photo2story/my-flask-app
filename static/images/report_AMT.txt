## American Tower Corp (AMT) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Summary:**

American Tower Corp (AMT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure.  The provided data shows AMT's cumulative return significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered, although recent performance has lagged.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition, but further analysis is needed.


**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **AMT Cumulative Return:** 68.74%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 56.37%
* **Return Difference:** 12.37% (AMT outperformed VOO by 12.37%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 40.9% (This indicates AMT's outperformance relative to its historical range of outperformance versus VOO).  This means that currently, AMT's outperformance is at the 40.9th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against VOO.

The alpha values in the provided table generally show positive excess returns over the benchmark (presumably the market), though the magnitude varies over time.  The beta values, however, suggest increasing sensitivity to market movements in recent years (increasing from ~0.1 to 0.7).  This implies increased risk relative to the market over the past years.  The company's market capitalization (Cap(B)) has grown significantly over the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $207.97
* **Last Market Price:** $207.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $218.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $214.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $199.40

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, suggesting a longer-term upward trend might still be intact.  The recent price drop of $2.55 (from $213.39 to $207.94) represents a relatively significant negative shift.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)  The MRI suggests a high risk level for the stock.
* **RSI:** 43.40 (Approaching oversold territory; RSI values below 30 are generally considered oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.32 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +6.7 (Short-term upward trend in relative strength)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.9% (This indicates an expected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon, considering current conditions). The negative expected return, in combination with other indicators like MRI and PPO, suggests caution.

The recent price drop of -2.55 reflects a notable short-term decline. While the 20-day relative divergence shows a short-term upward trend,  the other indicators (negative PPO, high MRI, and negative expected return) warrant caution.  The long-term outlook, while previously positive based on cumulative returns, now displays significant uncertainty, particularly given the substantial recent price decline and negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.

**Conclusion:**

While AMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, current indicators suggest a high-risk environment. The recent price drop and negative expected return should be carefully considered before making any investment decisions.  Further research into the underlying business fundamentals and market conditions is crucial to assess the long-term investment viability of AMT.
