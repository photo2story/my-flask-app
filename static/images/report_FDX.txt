## FedEx Corp. (FDX) Stock Analysis:

**Company Overview:** FedEx Corp. is a global courier delivery services company. 

**Performance Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (FDX):** 40.17%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 137.88%
* **Performance Gap:** -97.71% (Relative Gap: 3.12%)

FDX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, lagging behind by nearly 98%. Although its relative gap suggests it's in the bottom 3.12% of its historical performance against the S&P 500, this underperformance highlights the need for closer scrutiny of its current situation.

* **Closing Price:** $274.4
* **5-day Moving Average:** $270.77
* **20-day Moving Average:** $266.23
* **60-day Moving Average:** $281.72

The stock price is currently trading above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below its 60-day moving average. This suggests some recent weakness and potential for further consolidation before any significant upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 51.11 (Neutral)
* **PPO:** 0.72 (Slightly Bullish)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -3.12 (Short-term Downward Trend)

The RSI indicates neutral momentum, while the PPO suggests a slightly bullish bias. However, the recent relative divergence shows a short-term downward trend, contradicting the bullish signal from the PPO. The expected return of 0% over the long term indicates that FDX might struggle to outperform the S&P 500 in the foreseeable future.

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

**Recent Market Outlook:** The recent market outlook for FedEx is mixed. While the company is facing some challenges, such as rising competition and slowing global economic growth, there are also some potential growth opportunities, such as the continued growth of e-commerce.

**Analyst Opinions:**  Analysts have mixed opinions on FedEx's future performance. Some analysts believe that the company is well-positioned to benefit from long-term trends in e-commerce, while others are concerned about the company's profitability and its ability to compete in a challenging market.

**Performance Highlights:**  FedEx has been facing operational challenges and market headwinds in recent quarters. This has led to some concerns about the company's future growth prospects. However, FedEx has a strong brand and a long history of success, and it is possible that the company will be able to overcome these challenges and continue to grow in the long term.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

FDX faces a challenging environment characterized by underperformance relative to the S&P 500, fluctuating price action, and recent weakness in its earnings. While its current technical indicators present a mixed signal, the overall trend suggests that investors should proceed with caution. The company is likely to face headwinds in the foreseeable future, and its long-term expected return mirroring that of the S&P 500 doesn't present a compelling reason for outperformance. 

**7. Recommendation:**

Considering the mixed signals, investors looking for significant growth opportunities might want to explore other investment options.  It's recommended to keep a close eye on the company's performance and wait for more concrete signs of a turnaround before considering FDX for investment.
