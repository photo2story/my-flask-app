The latest earnings report for Q1 2024 showed EPS of $3.55, beating analysts' estimates of $3.07. Revenue came in at $21.74 billion, also exceeding expectations. However, the company's guidance for the full year suggests a slowdown in revenue growth.

**Overall Analysis:**

FDX's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. While the stock has shown strong momentum in recent months, it is currently trading in overbought territory according to RSI and is experiencing a short-term bearish divergence. Despite exceeding earnings expectations in Q1 2024, the company's outlook suggests slowing revenue growth, which may impact the stock's future performance.  The high expected return of 30.5% is based on current investment, but it's important to consider the potential risks and factors that could influence this return. 

**Recommendation:** 

While FDX has shown resilience and strength in recent months, its overbought condition and short-term bearish divergence suggest potential for a near-term correction. Investors should carefully consider the company's outlook and the overall market conditions before making any investment decisions.
