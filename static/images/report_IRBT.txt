*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values show significant risk and volatility over each period.
*   **Alpha:** Negative alpha consistently signifies underperformance compared to the benchmark (S&P 500), even when adjusted for risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta values generally around 1 suggest the stock's volatility is similar to the market, although it has fluctuated.
*   **Cap(B):** Declining capitalization.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 0.1199
*   **Last Market Data:** price=0.1199, previousClose=0.0, change=0.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.1257
*   **20-day SMA:** 1.6489
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.538

*   **Analysis:** The current price is significantly below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, confirming a strong downtrend. The 5-day SMA is also declining, suggesting continued short-term weakness. The fact that the previous close was zero suggests an incredibly sharp price drop.

**3) RSI, PPO Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 0.269 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -15.96 (Significantly oversold)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-15)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.6 (+), indicating a short-term rise.
*   **Expected Return:** -11612.3%
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The RSI suggests the stock is oversold and *could* be due for a bounce, but given the fundamentals, this might be a "dead cat bounce."
    *   The large negative PPO confirms the strong downward momentum.
    *   The hybrid signal is giving a cautious buy signal, but with no cash allocation.
    *   The short-term rise in relative divergence contradicts the current negative information.
    *   The *extremely* negative expected return highlights the high risk of long-term investment.
    *   The zero value of previousClose highlights the fluctuation issue.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Summary:** All headlines point to iRobot filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and being acquired by a Chinese company (likely a failed acquisition now). Short-sellers are vindicated.

*   **Impact:** This news is overwhelmingly negative and explains the stock's precipitous decline. The bankruptcy filing means existing shareholders are likely to lose most, if not all, of their investment.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:**
    *   Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell): N/A
    *   Opinions: 1
    *   Target Price (avg/high/low): 11.94 / 11.94 / 11.94

*   **Recent Rating Changes:**
    *   None

*   **Analysis:** The lack of consensus and only one analyst opinion, coupled with the bankruptcy news, suggests analysts are likely dropping coverage. The existing target price of $11.94 is now completely irrelevant.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜        | EPS   | 매출         |
| :---------- | :---- | :----------- |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.62 | 0.15 B$ |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.68 | 0.13 B$ |
| 2025-05-06 | -2.84 | 0.10 B$ |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$ |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$ |

*   **Analysis:** Earnings per share (EPS) has been consistently negative and declining. Revenue has also been inconsistent. This poor financial performance contributed to the bankruptcy.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
| :----------- | :-------- | :------------ |
| 2025-09-30 | $0.15B   | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.13B   | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.10B   | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B   | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.19B   | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE        |
| :----------- | :-------- | :--------- |
| 2025-09-30 | $-0.03B   | 80.07%     |
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.01B   | 296.52%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B    | -125.91%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B    | -4.24%     |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   While revenue was present, the negative equity and wildly fluctuating ROE values, particularly the astronomical ROE values despite negative equity, are red flags. The increasing negative equity ultimately led to the bankruptcy filing. The profit margin does not include the all the costs.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

iRobot (IRBT) is facing severe financial distress, culminating in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The stock has dramatically underperformed the market, with a massive negative divergence compared to the S&P 500. Recent news is overwhelmingly negative, and analyst coverage is likely dwindling.  The stock is deeply oversold, but this is likely a reflection of the company's fundamental issues rather than an opportunity for a significant rebound. The company's equity is negative, and the extremely high ROE in recent periods suggests accounting issues, not profitability.

**In conclusion, based on the provided information, investing in IRBT is extremely risky and not recommended.**
