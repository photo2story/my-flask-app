2026-01-10 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive report on IRBT (iRobot Corp), incorporating all the provided data points.

**Report on IRBT (iRobot Corp)**

**0) Executive Summary:**

iRobot Corp, a company known for its home robots like the Roomba, has recently filed for bankruptcy.  Its stock (IRBT) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), facing a substantial divergence. Recent financial data reveals consistently negative EPS, declining revenues, negative equity, and high volatility in ROE.  Technical indicators and analyst opinions paint a bleak picture.  The news flow is dominated by bankruptcy announcements. Investing in IRBT at this point is considered very risky.

**1) Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **Company Overview:** iRobot Corp designs, builds, and sells robots for the home, most notably the Roomba vacuum.
*   **IRBT Cumulative Return:** -97.31%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** +92.74%
*   **Divergence:** -189.1 (Relative Divergence: 1.1)

**Analysis:** The massive negative return of IRBT compared to the positive return of VOO highlights a severe underperformance.  The divergence of -189.1 indicates a significant difference in investment outcomes.  The relative divergence of 1.1 suggests that IRBT's current position is not within the range of the minimum to maximum, indicating an unpredictable situation.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | 44.0% | 38.8% | 41.0%   | 1.8  | 6.2    |
| 2017-2019  | -72.0%| 63.4% | -89.0%  | 1.9  | 3.8    |
| 2018-2020  | -53.0%| 65.1% | -74.0%  | 1.1  | 6.0    |
| 2019-2021  | -75.0%| 65.1% | -118.0% | 0.9  | 4.9    |
| 2020-2022  | -22.0%| 78.9% | -21.0%  | 0.9  | 3.6    |
| 2021-2023  | -125.0%| 72.6% | -126.0% | 0.8  | 2.9    |
| 2022-2024  | -60.0%| 84.2% | -80.0%  | 0.8  | 0.6    |
| 2023-2025  | -48.0%| 97.9% | -110.0% | 1.6  | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**  The table shows a concerning trend.  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is negative across all periods, indicating consistent losses.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is high, reflecting significant price declines. Alpha is largely negative, suggesting the stock is underperforming relative to its benchmark.  Beta generally indicates higher volatility compared to the market.  The decreasing market capitalization (Cap) towards zero signals severe financial distress.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 0.20
*   **Last-market:** None
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.1874
*   **20-day SMA:** 1.0188
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.2853

**Analysis:** The stock price is extremely low. The declining Simple Moving Averages (SMA) indicate a strong downward trend in the stock price over the short, medium, and long term. The "Last-market: None" likely reflects trading halts or suspension due to bankruptcy proceedings.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 16.51
*   **PPO:** -9.82
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-15)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10489.9%

**Analysis:** The MRI of 0.7 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, but *this is highly misleading* given the bankruptcy news.  The Extremely low RSI (below 30) typically indicates an oversold condition, but in this case, it is more likely reflecting extreme distress and potential worthlessness. The negative PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) confirms the downtrend. The hybrid signal suggests buying 80% of cash with caution, but this recommendation should be disregarded given the circumstances. The "Short-term rise" in relative divergence may be a dead cat bounce. The Expected Return of -10489.9% is catastrophic, indicating a complete loss of investment.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   Multiple news articles all report iRobot's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
*   Articles discuss the reasons for bankruptcy, including debt, competition, and the failed acquisition by Amazon.
*   One article mentions a short-seller who profited from betting against iRobot.
*   Headlines are overwhelmingly negative and focused on the implications of the bankruptcy for investors.

**Analysis:** The news flow is entirely focused on the bankruptcy filing. This is a critical piece of information that overrides any positive technical indicators or historical data. The negative news flow strongly reinforces a "sell" or "avoid" recommendation.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Mean Recommendation:** No meaningful consensus due to the situation.
*   **Target Price:** $11.94 (Irrelevant now).

**Analysis:** Analyst opinions and target prices are irrelevant at this point given the bankruptcy.  Previous targets are meaningless.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.62 | 0.15 B$      |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.68 | 0.13 B$      |
| 2025-05-06 | -2.84 | 0.10 B$      |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$      |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$      |

**Analysis:** The table reveals consistently negative Earnings Per Share (EPS) and a general downtrend in quarterly revenue. This demonstrates declining profitability and worsening financial health. The repeated date "2025-11-06" seems like a data duplication.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.15B  | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.13B  | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.10B  | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B  | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.19B  | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE          |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $-0.03B | 80.07%       |
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.01B | 296.52%      |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B | 11005.42%    |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B  | -125.91%     |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B  | -4.24%       |

**Analysis:** Revenue has generally been declining.  While the profit margins are positive for most quarters, the more critical issue is the *negative equity* in the recent quarters. Negative equity means the company's liabilities exceed its assets.  The extremely high (and volatile) Return on Equity (ROE) figures are misleading due to the negative equity base; small changes in profit result in huge percentage swings in ROE when equity is close to zero or negative.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

The overall picture for IRBT is extremely negative. The company has filed for bankruptcy, its stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, and its financial health is deteriorating rapidly.  Negative EPS, declining revenue, negative equity, and the torrent of negative news surrounding the bankruptcy all point to a very high-risk, likely value-destroying investment.  Technical indicators, while sometimes suggesting oversold conditions, should be interpreted with extreme caution in light of the fundamental issues. **Investing in IRBT at this point is highly speculative and carries a very significant risk of total loss.**
