**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Shows a dramatic shift from strong growth in the 2015-2018 period to significant negative returns in recent years.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.  MDD increases in more recent years.
*   **Alpha:** Largely negative, implying that iRobot has underperformed its benchmark (the market) on a risk-adjusted basis.  The negative Alpha has worsened considerably in recent periods.
*   **Beta:** Low Beta values (close to 0) suggesting the price of this stock is independent to market risk and/or index performance.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):**  A drastic decrease in market capitalization, reflecting the declining stock value.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 0.14
*   **Last-market:** None
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.23
*   **20-day SMA:** 2.15
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.84

    **Analysis:** The stock price is extremely low, at $0.14. The 5-day SMA is significantly lower than both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a recent and sharp downward trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - *This is highly questionable given the other data.*
*   **RSI:** 26.93 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -18.04 (Significantly Below Zero, suggesting a strong downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1000 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)" *This is a flawed recommendation*
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -7.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -12247.3%

    **Analysis:**

    *   The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which *could* suggest a potential for a bounce, but in the context of bankruptcy, it's more likely a sign of continued distress.
    *   The PPO confirms a strong and persistent downtrend.
    *   **The MRI recommending "High Investment" is highly misleading and likely based on flawed logic. This is a very risky investment.**
    *   The extremely negative expected return (-12247.3%) confirms the severe challenges the company faces.
    *   The Hybrid Signal is inconsistent with the company's bankruptcy and poor performance. It should not be considered reliable.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   iRobot Bankruptcy:
    *   Files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
    *   Stock price collapses.
    *   Delisting from Nasdaq expected.
    *   Debt and competition cited as causes.
*   Valuation after White House Robotics Order Hype: Suggests earlier positive news failed to sustain the company.

    **Analysis:** The news is overwhelmingly negative, focused on the company's bankruptcy filing. This confirms the financial distress indicated by the other data points.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:**  Negative (no strong buy/sell consensus, likely due to uncertainty).
*   **Target Price:** $11.94 (Significantly higher than the current price, but likely outdated).
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not Available.

    **Analysis:**  The analyst target price is almost meaningless at this point given the bankruptcy filing. Analyst coverage is likely to be suspended or significantly reduced.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

|------------|-------|-----------|

| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$   |

**Analysis:**
*   Consistently negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) values indicate that the company has been losing money. The EPS worsened dramatically in 2025-05-06.
*   Revenue has been inconsistent and generally trending downwards.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B    | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B    | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B    | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B    | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B    | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE          |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B   | 80.07%       |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B   | 296.52%      |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%    |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B    | -125.91%      |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B    | -4.24%        |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Declining revenue in recent quarters indicates weakening sales.
*   **Profit Margin:** Fluctuating, but generally positive, before the bankruptcy. However, higher profit margin with declining revenue could indicate cost-cutting measures, or decrease in material costs.
*   **Equity:** Has turned sharply negative, indicating that the company's liabilities exceed its assets. This is a major sign of financial distress.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is erratic but the later values are high due to the calculation of ROE. ROE = Net Income/Total Equity, since total equity is negative, this causes a high number.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

iRobot (IRBT) is in severe financial distress and has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  The stock has dramatically underperformed the market, with a massive negative divergence from the S&P 500. Recent news is overwhelmingly negative, focusing on the bankruptcy filing and potential delisting. The company's equity has turned negative, and the expectation is a high chance of losses in the future. While the RSI indicates the stock is oversold, it is likely a sign of continued decline rather than a buying opportunity.
