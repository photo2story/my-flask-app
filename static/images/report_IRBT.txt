**1) Comparative Return Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** iRobot Corp designs, manufactures, and sells robots, primarily for the home cleaning market (e.g., Roomba).
*   **Return Comparison:** IRBT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). IRBT's cumulative return is -85.92% compared to VOO's 101.92%.
*   **Divergence Analysis:** The divergence of -181.2 suggests a substantial gap between IRBT's performance and the S&P 500.  A relative divergence of 0.6 places the current divergence near the minimum end of its historical range. This means the underperformance is currently at its worst (based on historical data), but it also means it has the potential to increase its divergence from the S&P 500 (a negative direction).
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 77.0%    | 67.0%  | 48.0%   | 0.1   | 2.4   |
| 2016-2018  | 69.0%    | 74.9%  | 54.0%   | 0.1   | 2.7   |
| 2017-2019  | -68.0%   | 74.9%  | -90.0%  | 0.2   | 1.6   |
| 2018-2020  | -62.0%   | 75.9%  | -86.0%  | 0.1   | 2.6   |
| 2019-2021  | -90.0%   | 75.9%  | -136.0% | 0.1   | 2.1   |
| 2020-2022  | -29.0%   | 75.9%  | -28.0%  | -0.3  | 1.5   |
| 2021-2023  | -142.0%  | 75.5%  | -143.0% | -0.2  | 1.2   |
| 2022-2024  | -69.0%   | 85.8%  | -89.0%  | -0.3  | 0.2   |
| 2023-2025  | -38.0%   | 85.8%  | -105.0% | -0.1  | 0.1   |

*   **CAGR:** CAGR(Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been negative in recent periods, indicating significant losses.
*   **MDD:** MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, showing substantial risk (large percentage losses) for investors.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is significantly negative in recent periods, indicating the stock is underperforming relative to its benchmark *after* accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta is low, meaning that iRobot stock price had small correlation to the overall market's movement, regardless of which direction.
*   **Cap(B):** Company Market Cap is declining drastically.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Price:** The current price is significantly below both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This suggests a recent downtrend.
*   **Last-market:** Negative price change compared to the previous close.
*   **SMA Trend:**  The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, confirming a short-term downtrend and suggesting continued downward momentum.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.9 suggests the model considers iRobot to be in the *High Investment Recommended* zone, which is *highly contradictory* considering all the other information. This likely means the MRI model relies on different variables or weights them in a way that's not reflective of the stock's recent performance.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 28.17 indicates the stock is approaching *oversold* conditions.  This *could* signal a potential for a short-term bounce, but it's not a guaranteed indicator of a reversal.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -1.48 suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, further confirming the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is indicating 100% of cash should be used to buy (250 shares). Although it is flagged as very safe with a MRI of 0.90, there is a serious contradiction in this recommendation compared to the other data.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The short-term decline in relative divergence aligns with the recent negative price action.
*   **Expected Return:**  An *extremely* negative expected return of -11852.9% is a major red flag.  This suggests the model anticipates significant continued underperformance.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** The news headlines are overwhelmingly negative:
    *   **Bankruptcy Fears:** "IRobot Stock Hits Fresh Lows, Reigniting Bankruptcy Fears" points to serious financial concerns.
    *   **Acquisition Troubles:** "iRobot stock falls after revealing lowball acquisition offer" and "iRobot stock tumbles 33% after Roomba maker warns the search for a buyer has stalled" suggest problems with potential acquisitions, adding to investor uncertainty.
    *   **Confidence Lacking:** "Some Confidence Is Lacking In iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) As Shares Slide 32%" highlights the lack of investor faith.
*   **One Positive Note:** "iRobot in 'really interesting' growth phase, says marketing chief; shares soar" This might be a temporary bounce, but there are some positive prospects in the news.
*   **Valuation Review:** "A Fresh Look at iRobot (IRBT) Valuation Following Short Squeeze and AI-Powered Product Launch" - this points to an attempt to re-evaluate the company's worth, potentially triggered by a short squeeze (which is often temporary).

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Limited Coverage:** Only one analyst opinion is available.
*   **Target Price:** The average target price of $11.94 is significantly higher than the current price. This means analysts believe this stock is going to rebound by a large margin, or that their data is inaccurate.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B  | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B  | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B  | 20.00%        |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B  | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE        |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B   | 80.07%     |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B   | 296.52%    |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B    | -4.24%     |

*   **Declining Revenue:** As seen in the earnings data, revenue is trending downwards.
*   **Negative Equity:**  The most concerning aspect is the *negative* equity in recent quarters. This means the company's liabilities exceed its assets, a very serious financial situation.
*   **ROE Volatility:** The ROE (Return on Equity) is wildly volatile and extremely high (in a nonsensical way) when equity is negative, making it an unreliable metric. This further highlights the severity of the negative equity situation.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Distressed Company:** iRobot appears to be a company in significant financial distress. The negative equity, declining revenue, consistent losses, and negative news headlines paint a bleak picture.
*   **High Risk:** Investing in IRBT is currently extremely risky. The negative divergence from the S&P 500, negative expected return, and troubling financial metrics all point to a high probability of continued underperformance and potential bankruptcy.
*   **Contradictory MRI:**  The MRI suggesting "High Investment Recommended" is an outlier and should be viewed with extreme skepticism in light of all the other data.
*   **Acquisition Hopes Dashed:** Hopes for a buyout have diminished, further eroding investor confidence.
*   **Oversold, But...** The RSI indicates the stock is approaching oversold conditions, which *could* lead to a temporary bounce. However, this is not a reason to invest given the fundamental problems the company faces.
*   **Analyst Targets:** Analyst target prices are significantly higher than the current price, suggesting a potential upside if the company can turn things around. However, given the current financial situation, those targets seem overly optimistic.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data provided, iRobot (IRBT) is a high-risk investment with significant challenges. The company's financial health is deteriorating, and negative news and market sentiment are exacerbating the situation. While a short-term bounce is possible, the long-term outlook appears grim. Investment is *not* recommended at this time.
