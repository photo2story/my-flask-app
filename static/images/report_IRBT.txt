2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of iRobot (IRBT) based on the provided data.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Company Overview:** iRobot Corp designs, manufactures, and sells robots, including the Roomba vacuum.
*   **IRBT Cumulative Return:** -98.96%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 91.40%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -204.0
    *   Range: Max: 112.2, Min: -206.2
    *   Relative Divergence: 0.7
*   **Analysis:** IRBT has drastically underperformed the S&P 500. The divergence of -204.0 highlights the severe difference in returns. The relative divergence of 0.7 suggests that the current level of underperformance is near the low end of its historical range, but this is hardly a positive given the massive negative divergence.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | 44.0%    | 100.0%  | 41.0%    | 1.8   | 11.3   |
| 2017-2019  | -72.0%   | 99.8%  | -89.0%   | 1.9   | 6.8    |
| 2018-2020  | -53.0%   | 99.9%  | -74.0%   | 1.1   | 10.8   |
| 2019-2021  | -75.0%   | 99.9%  | -118.0%  | 0.9   | 8.9    |
| 2020-2022  | -22.0%   | 99.9%  | -21.0%   | 0.9   | 6.5    |
| 2021-2023  | -125.0%  | 99.7%  | -126.0%  | 0.8   | 5.2    |
| 2022-2024  | -60.0%   | 0.0%    | -80.0%   | 0.8   | 1.1    |
| 2023-2025  | -48.0%   | 0.0%    | -110.0%  | 1.6   | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:**  Consistently negative in recent periods, indicating significant value destruction.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is near 100% for most periods, illustrating catastrophic losses for investors who held the stock during those times.  The 0% MDD for the last two periods likely reflects the already near-zero price, so further drawdown wasn't possible.
*   **Alpha:**  Large negative alpha values confirm significant underperformance relative to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta values generally range from 0.8 to 1.9, suggesting that IRBT stock price has been more volatile than the overall market (S&P 500), amplifying both gains and losses.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization has shrunk drastically, indicative of the company's declining value.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 0.11
*   **Last Market:** Price: 0.11, Previous Close: 0.0, Change: 0.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.13
*   **20-day SMA:** 1.81
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.61

*   **Analysis:** The current price is extremely low.  The SMA values show a steep decline. The 5-day SMA is below the 20 and 60-day, confirming the recent downward trend. The "previousClose" of 0.0 indicates potential data issues, but it doesn't invalidate the conclusion that the stock price has collapsed.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) *This contradicts all other data and is likely an error given the bankruptcy filing. DO NOT USE THIS.*
*   **RSI:** 0.06 (Extremely Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -16.81 (Significantly Below Zero, indicating a strong downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash\_0%\_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-15) *Again, the recommendation is questionable given the bankruptcy.*
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.7 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase) *While there may have been a short-term bounce, this is likely irrelevant in the context of the bankruptcy.*
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 (No expected excess return)

*   **Analysis:** The RSI indicates an extremely oversold condition, which *could* suggest a potential for a rebound, *but* in the context of bankruptcy, this is far from a reliable signal.  The PPO confirms a strong and sustained downtrend. The MRI is unreliable in this situation. The recent divergence change is likely a minor blip in a larger collapse. The expected return is 0.0, indicating no anticipated gains relative to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines are dominated by the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Articles highlight the reasons for the bankruptcy, the impact on the stock, and what happens next for the company. The article on investors chasing shares higher despite the bankruptcy is particularly concerning, suggesting speculative trading rather than fundamental investment.
*   **Concrete Impact:** The news confirms the dire financial situation and explains the stock's collapse. The bankruptcy filing is a critical event that fundamentally alters the investment outlook for IRBT.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Negative (No specific rating)
*   **Opinions:** 1
*   **Target Price:** $11.94 (This target price is outdated and irrelevant given the current circumstances)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent changes reported.

*   **Analysis:** The single analyst opinion and target price are likely outdated and should not be considered reliable given the recent bankruptcy.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.62 | 0.15 B$   |

| 2024-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$   |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$   |

*   **Analysis:**  The company has consistently reported negative EPS (Earnings Per Share), indicating losses. Revenue has generally been declining, particularly noticeable in 2025. The most recent EPS of -$0.62 is better than -$2.84 of the previous quarter.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B    | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B    | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B    | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B    | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B    | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE         |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B   | 80.07%      |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B   | 296.52%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B    | -125.91%     |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B    | -4.24%      |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Revenue has fluctuated and generally declined.
    *   Profit margins have been positive, which is somewhat surprising given the overall financial situation, but may not be sustainable.
    *   **Most critically, equity has turned negative, indicating that liabilities exceed assets. This is a major red flag and a key indicator of the company's financial distress.**
    *   ROE (Return on Equity) is extremely volatile and positive in recent quarters *only because equity is negative*. This creates a misleading picture of profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **IRBT has experienced catastrophic underperformance compared to the S&P 500.** Its cumulative return is far below that of the index.
*   **The company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, indicating severe financial distress.** This is the single most important factor.
*   **Financial metrics such as negative equity and declining revenue and profits confirm the company's precarious position.**
*   **The stock price has collapsed.** Technical indicators such as the RSI are oversold but unreliable in the context of bankruptcy.
*   **Analyst opinions and target prices are outdated and should not be used.**
*   **The MRI indicator is likely incorrect and should be disregarded.**

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, investing in IRBT is exceptionally risky. The company's bankruptcy filing should be the primary consideration. While some speculative traders might attempt to profit from short-term price movements, a fundamental investment in IRBT is highly discouraged. It is vital to carefully consider the risks associated with bankruptcy and the potential for significant losses.
