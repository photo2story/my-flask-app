**Analysis:** The table paints a dire picture.  CAGR has been consistently negative in recent periods. Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is high, indicating significant peak-to-trough declines. Alpha is also strongly negative, suggesting the stock has significantly underperformed its expected return based on its risk (Beta). Beta is low, but that hasn't helped given the negative Alpha. The Market Cap has declined drastically.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Last Close:** 0.1351
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.1621
*   **20-day SMA:** 2.0732
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.7761

**Analysis:** The stock price is extremely low, suggesting it is essentially trading as a penny stock. The 5-day SMA is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMA, indicating a recent downward trend. All moving averages are declining.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 28.86
*   **PPO:** -17.90
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1000 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -12306.4%

**Analysis:** The RSI of 28.86 suggests the stock is nearing oversold conditions. The PPO is deeply negative, indicating a strong downward trend. The "Hybrid Signal" is strangely contradictory, recommending to "Buy 100% of cash", and is likely an automated output that doesn't adequately account for the company's bankruptcy filing. The large negative Expected Return suggests significant risks and potential further declines. The MRI shows that the program calculates the stock to be a "High Investment Recommended," which is not recommended as this indicator does not reflect the recent news of bankruptcy.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Bankruptcy Filing:** Multiple news articles confirm that iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
*   **Impact on Stock:** The news reports that the stock price has collapsed as a result of the bankruptcy filing.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** Show average target price of 11.94 which likely doesn't represent current conditions.

**Analysis:** The news is overwhelmingly negative. The bankruptcy filing is a critical event that dramatically alters the investment outlook for IRBT. This news overrides any previous analysis or recommendations. The stock is likely to be highly volatile and extremely risky.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Not Available
*   **Target Price:** $11.94 (likely outdated)

**Analysis:** The analyst target price is likely outdated and doesn't reflect the bankruptcy news. Analyst opinions should be viewed with extreme skepticism in light of the recent events.

|------------|--------|---------|

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2025-09-30 | $0.15B   | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.13B   | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.10B   | 20.00%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE        |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $-0.03B  | 80.07%     |
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.01B  | 296.52%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B  | 11005.42%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B   | -125.91%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B   | -4.24%     |

**Analysis:** While profit margins appear positive, the Equity turning negative is a very concerning sign. The extremely high ROE values are meaningless given the negative equity. This indicates the company is financially distressed, contributing to the bankruptcy filing.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

iRobot (IRBT) is in severe financial distress, culminating in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500.  Recent price action is negative, and the technical indicators do not accurately reflect the company's situation. News headlines are overwhelmingly negative. Recent earnings show consistent losses. Analyst opinions are outdated and should not be relied upon. The financial data shows negative equity and unsustainable financial metrics. **Investing in IRBT is extremely risky and not recommended.** The high MRI value appears to be a miscalculation based on stale data and should be disregarded. Any positive signals from automated systems should be ignored given the bankruptcy news.
