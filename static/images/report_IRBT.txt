| 2023-2025  | -34.0% | 85.8%  | -99.0%  | -0.1   | 0.1    |

*   **CAGR:** Consistently negative CAGR in recent periods indicates sustained losses.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values reflect significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha values indicate that iRobot is underperforming its benchmark (risk-adjusted return).
*   **Beta:** Low Beta values around 0 indicate that the stock price is less sensitive to general market moves (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** Decreasing capitalization over time suggests the company's market value is shrinking.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 1.9899
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 2.0, Previous Close: 1.69, Change: 18.34%
*   **5-day SMA:** 1.662
*   **20-day SMA:** 1.9842
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.3031

**Analysis:** The stock is trading below its 60-day moving average but near its 20-day moving average. The recent price increase of 18.34% is a significant jump, but caution should be exercised. The moving averages suggest a downtrend over the longer term.

**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators and Divergence**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended - However, consider this *in conjunction* with all the other negative indicators).
*   **RSI:** 39.99 (Slightly oversold, but not extremely so).
*   **PPO:** 0.542 (Slightly bullish).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash 0% / Buy 100% (This is presented as very safe, but with the numerous other red flags, this is highly questionable).
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.0 (Short-term decline).
*   **Expected Return (%):** -12026.0 (Extremely negative - suggests very high risk and potential for substantial losses).

**Analysis:** While the MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" position, this seems contradictory given the negative expected return and other warning signs. The RSI being near 40 might suggest a slight oversold condition, but it's not a strong buy signal. The very negative expected return is a major cause for concern.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **iRobot Faces Financial Turning Point As Earnings Beat Expectations:** This sounds positive, but needs careful examination.

**Analysis:** The news is overwhelmingly negative. Bankruptcy fears are a significant red flag. The failed acquisition attempts and lowball offers suggest that potential buyers see significant risk. While some articles mention earnings "beating expectations", consider this in the context of already very low expectations.

*   **Mean:** -
*   **Opinions:** 1
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 11.94

**6) Financial Information**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B    | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B    | 30.02%        |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE         |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B   | 80.07%      |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B   | 296.52%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%   |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B    | -4.24%      |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profit Margin:** While profit margins seem decent, the decreasing revenue trend is a cause for concern. The profit margin percentages need to be carefully examined against the company's overall expenses.
*   **Equity and ROE:** Negative equity is an extremely serious indicator of financial distress. Extremely high ROE values when equity is negative are mathematically meaningless and do *not* indicate strong performance. This further highlights the company's financial instability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

iRobot Corp. is facing a multitude of problems:

*   **Severe Underperformance:** The stock is significantly underperforming the market.
*   **Financial Distress:** Negative equity, consistent losses, and decreasing revenue paint a grim picture.
*   **Bankruptcy Risk:** Recent news and failed acquisition attempts suggest a real possibility of bankruptcy.
*   **Low Analyst Confidence:** Limited analyst coverage and low target prices reflect a lack of optimism.
*   **Contradictory Indicators:** The MRI suggesting "High Investment Recommended" contradicts the overwhelming evidence of high risk and potential losses.

**Recommendation:** Based on the data provided, investing in iRobot Corp. at this time appears to be **extremely risky**. The negative trends across financial metrics, combined with negative news and analyst sentiment, suggest that the company is facing significant challenges. A very thorough and cautious approach is warranted.
