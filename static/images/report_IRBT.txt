2025-12-22 - Analysis Report
Here's a breakdown of iRobot Corp (IRBT) based on the provided data:

**0) Overview**

Here's a summary of the analysis presented below. iRobot Corp. (IRBT) is a consumer robot company known for its Roomba vacuum cleaner.  However, the data indicates severe financial distress culminating in a recent bankruptcy filing.  The stock has performed poorly, drastically underperforming the S&P 500. All indicators and news point to a very high-risk situation with significant potential for further losses.

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** iRobot Corp. is a consumer robot company known for its Roomba vacuum cleaner.
*   **Cumulative Return (IRBT):** -95.75%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -196.6 (Relative Divergence: 0.0)

**Analysis:**

IRBT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). The large negative divergence and near-zero relative divergence indicate that IRBT's performance is at the extreme low end of its historical fluctuation range compared to the market. This signifies a very poor investment performance and a substantial deviation from the overall market trend.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows some concerning trends:

*   **Declining CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has deteriorated significantly over the periods, turning negative and deeply negative in recent years.
*   **High MDD:** Maximum Drawdown (MDD) remains high, indicating significant potential for capital loss.
*   **Negative Alpha:**  Alpha, which measures performance relative to the benchmark, is consistently negative and worsening, indicating underperformance even when accounting for market risk.
*   **Beta Fluctuations:** Beta, representing the stock's volatility compared to the market, fluctuates but remains relatively high in some periods, suggesting higher sensitivity to market movements but failing to capitalize on positive market trends.
*   **Declining Market Cap:** Market capitalization has plummeted, reflecting the company's declining value.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** $0.4664
*   **Previous Close:** $0.6668
*   **Change:** -30.05%
*   **5-day SMA:** $0.7666
*   **20-day SMA:** $2.4237
*   **60-day SMA:** $3.0678

**Analysis:**

The stock is experiencing a sharp decline. The current price is far below all moving averages, indicating strong downward momentum. The significant negative change from the previous close reinforces this bearish trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment - borderline Low Investment)
*   **RSI:** 41.60 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -12.96 (Significantly Negative)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (Based on algorithm/model with a Very Safe profile with high MRI)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -7.8 (Negative, indicating a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -12247.3%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates a medium level of risk. However, this indicator might not fully capture the current situation given the recent news.
*   The RSI is approaching oversold territory, suggesting the stock *may* be due for a bounce, but this could be a "dead cat bounce" given the fundamental problems.
*   The PPO is strongly negative, confirming a downtrend in the stock's momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal, suggesting a complete investment despite the MRI, should be interpreted with extreme caution given the recent news and other indicators. The "Very Safe" profile may be based on outdated data.
*   The large negative expected return suggests significant potential for continued losses.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Takeaway:** The news is overwhelmingly negative, dominated by reports of iRobot's bankruptcy filing and related analyses.

**Analysis:**

The news flow paints a dire picture. The bankruptcy filing is a critical event that will likely have a significant negative impact on the stock price. Articles discussing short-sellers betting against the company and the implications of the bankruptcy for investors further highlight the high-risk nature of the investment.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Lack of a defined consensus.
*   **Target Price:** $11.94 (However, this target price is likely outdated and irrelevant given the bankruptcy filing.)

**Analysis:**

The analyst target price is essentially meaningless at this point due to the bankruptcy.

| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$        |

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B     | 31.03%         |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B     | 30.02%         |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B     | 20.00%         |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B     | 9.54%          |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B     | 32.25%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE         |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B    | 80.07%      |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B    | 296.52%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B    | 11005.42%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B     | -125.91%    |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B     | -4.24%      |

**Analysis:**

The financial information reinforces the negative picture. While profit margins appear high on some quarters, they are misleading since revenues are lower, and equity is negative. Of most concern is the trend of negative equity. With consistently negative Equity, Return on Equity (ROE) is meaningless, since ROE = Net Income / Equity, making the fraction have a negative denominator.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

All the provided data points to a company in severe financial distress. The stock has drastically underperformed the market. Recent news of bankruptcy confirms these struggles. Key indicators like CAGR, Alpha, and Expected Return are all deeply negative. Technical indicators show strong downward momentum. Financial metrics highlight declining revenue, consistent losses, and troubling trends like plummeting Equity.

**Conclusion:**
Investment in iRobot (IRBT) is currently extremely high-risk. Given the bankruptcy filing, investors should proceed with extreme caution.
