*   The negative change in relative divergence suggests short-term downward pressure.
*   The extremely negative expected return is a significant red flag, indicating a very pessimistic outlook for long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
| :----------- | :---------- | :-------------- |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.13B     | 30.02%          |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.10B     | 20.00%          |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B     | 9.54%           |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.19B     | 32.25%          |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.17B     | 16.51%          |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity      | ROE        |
| :----------- | :---------- | :--------- |
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.01B    | 296.52%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B    | 11005.42%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B     | -125.91%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B     | -4.24%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.15B     | -47.39%    |

**Analysis:** While revenue figures show some variability, the profit margins appear relatively stable, although this doesn't translate to overall profitability. The negative equity in the most recent quarters is concerning, and the extremely high ROE figures are likely distorted due to the negative equity.

**7. Overall Assessment**

Based on the provided data, iRobot (IRBT) presents a high-risk investment opportunity. Key concerns include:

*   **Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.**
*   **Consistent negative EPS and ROE.**
*   **Negative equity in recent quarters.**
*   **Highly negative expected return.**
*   **Negative Alpha values demonstrating underperformance compared to the market.**

While there are some potentially positive signals such as recent earnings beating expectations and a positive, but very small, change from the last market data, these are outweighed by the numerous negative factors. The analyst target price suggests potential upside, but this is only one data point and should be considered with caution.

**Recommendation:** Given the substantial risks, a cautious approach is warranted. Thorough due diligence, including a deeper dive into the company's financials, competitive landscape, and growth strategy, is strongly recommended before considering an investment in IRBT. The recent news regarding humanoid robots also warrants consideration as it could impact the broader robotics sector and iRobot's future prospects.
