    *   **Hybrid Signal:** Is contradictory given the current situation
    *   **Divergence Change:** The recent drop in relative divergence indicates the downward trend is accelerating.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   iRobot (IRBT) Valuation After White House Robotics Order Hype and Recent Share Price Surge
    *   iRobot Bankruptcy: How Debt and Competition Crushed Its Stock
    *   A short-seller who bet against now-bankrupt iRobot for a decade unpacks how he identifies his bearish targets

    *   iRobot Just Filed for Bankruptcy. What Does That Mean for IRBT Stock? And Why Have Investors Been Chasing Shares Higher?
*   **Analysis:** The news is overwhelmingly negative. The company filing for bankruptcy dominates the headlines. The "Strategic Transaction" news item is likely a restructuring effort related to the bankruptcy.  The mentions of "investors chasing shares higher" *despite* bankruptcy likely indicate speculative trading, not genuine investment.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:**  None.
*   **Target Price:** $11.94 (This target price is likely outdated given the recent bankruptcy filing and is no longer relevant.)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent changes are listed.
*   **Analysis:** The lack of a consensus and the outdated target price further illustrate the uncertainty surrounding the stock. Any previous positive outlooks are invalidated by the bankruptcy.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
| :----------- | :---------- | :------------ |
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B      | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B      | 30.02%        |

| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B      | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B      | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity      | ROE          |
| :----------- | :---------- | :----------- |
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B     | 80.07%       |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B     | 296.52%      |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B     | 11005.42%    |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B      | -125.91%     |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B      | -4.24%       |

*   **Revenue:** Revenue is trending downwards, which mirrors the 매출 data from the earnings section.
*   **Profit Margin:** While the profit margins appear high on the surface, they should be viewed with extreme skepticism given the context of the bankruptcy. These might reflect accounting adjustments or one-time events.
*   **Equity:** *Negative* equity is a very serious warning sign. It means the company's liabilities exceed its assets.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** The ROE is extremely high due to the negative equity. This does not indicate strong performance. It is a distortion caused by the severe financial distress.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Financial Distress:**  iRobot is in severe financial distress and has filed for bankruptcy. This is the most important factor in the analysis.
*   **Underperformance:** The stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 and its historical performance.
*   **Negative Financials:** Revenue is declining, EPS is consistently negative, and the company has negative equity.
*   **Contradictory Indicators:** While some indicators (like MRI) might suggest medium risk, they are contradicted by the overwhelming evidence of bankruptcy and financial distress.
*   **Speculative Trading:** The fact that the stock is being chased higher despite bankruptcy suggests that any current price movement is driven by speculation, not fundamentals.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, **investing in iRobot (IRBT) is exceptionally risky**. The company has filed for bankruptcy, is experiencing severe financial distress, and has dramatically underperformed the market. Any investment at this point would be purely speculative.  The negative expected return of -12247.3% is a clear indicator of the potential for catastrophic losses.
