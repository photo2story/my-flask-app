*   **RSI:** 45.08
*   **PPO:** -10.40

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -5.6 (negative trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -12203.0%

    *   The negative PPO indicates a downtrend.
    *   The Hybrid Signal provides a counterintuitive recommendation considering the bankruptcy.  This highlights the limitations of automated systems without incorporating fundamental news.
    *   The large negative expected return indicates a very pessimistic outlook.

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   iRobot files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
    *   Analyst discussion on short-selling iRobot.

*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 11.94 / 11.94 / 11.94

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

iRobot is in severe financial distress, culminating in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. This is supported by consistently negative earnings, declining revenue, negative equity, and a massive underperformance compared to the S&P 500. Recent stock price movements reflect this crisis, and traditional technical indicators are unlikely to provide meaningful insight in this situation. Analyst ratings and target prices are outdated and should be disregarded.

**In summary, based on the information provided, an investment in iRobot is currently considered extremely risky and not recommended.**
