    **Analysis:** The news is overwhelmingly negative. The company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which explains the stock price collapse. The previous "hype" around a robotics order now appears irrelevant in light of the financial distress.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue    |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.62 | 0.15 B$    |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.68 | 0.13 B$    |
| 2025-05-06 | -2.84 | 0.10 B$    |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$    |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$    |

    **Analysis:**  Earnings per share (EPS) have been consistently negative, and have recently declined. Revenue is also decreasing, which is a major red flag.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B  | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B  | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B  | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B  | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B  | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE         |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B   | 80.07%      |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B   | 296.52%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B    | -125.91%    |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B    | -4.24%      |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been declining over the recent quarters. Most concerning is the negative equity in the most recent quarters. While the Return on Equity (ROE) figures are very high for the most recent quarters, this is likely due to the negative equity (ROE is calculated as Net Income / Equity; dividing by a negative number can result in very large positive or negative values, which are not meaningful in this context).

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Financial Distress:** iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, indicating severe financial problems.
*   **Poor Performance:** The stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, with a massive negative divergence.
*   **Negative Trends:** Revenue, EPS, and equity are all declining.
*   **Oversold Condition:** RSI indicates the stock is oversold, but this is likely due to the bankruptcy news.
*   **High Risk:** The expected return is extremely negative, indicating a very high-risk investment.
*   **Outdated Analyst Views:** Existing analyst target prices are likely irrelevant.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, iRobot (IRBT) appears to be in a very precarious situation. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is a significant event that suggests a high probability of further losses for investors. **Investing in IRBT at this point is highly speculative and carries extreme risk.**
