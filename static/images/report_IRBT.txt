**Analysis of Table Data:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows significant negative returns in recent periods, highlighting a consistent decline in the company's performance.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial risk, with drawdowns exceeding 70% in most periods, suggesting high volatility and potential for significant losses.
*   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha values from 2017 onwards suggest that IRBT has consistently underperformed its benchmark, indicating poor stock selection relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values close to 0 indicate that the stock has little correlation to the overall market, making it less influenced by market trends.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 1.5
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 1.5, 'previousClose': 1.42, 'change': 5.63}
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 1.62
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 2.3895
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 3.4344

**Analysis of Price Action:** The stock is trading below all its key moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a downtrend. The recent price increase of 5.63% from the previous close could signal a potential short-term rebound, but it needs to be sustained to reverse the overall bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 13.42 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -4.50
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (250 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-02)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** 0.6 (+) Short-term rise
*   **Expected Return:** -11780.5%

**Analysis of Indicators:** The extremely low RSI value (13.42) indicates that the stock is heavily oversold, which *could* lead to a bounce.  The PPO is negative, confirming the downtrend. MRI suggests medium investment risk, but the other indicators and news suggest otherwise. Despite the "Buy" hybrid signal, the extremely negative expected return significantly tempers any optimism. The short-term rise in relative divergence could indicate a temporary upward move, but it's unlikely to change the overall negative outlook. The significant price change (5.63%) from the previous close does signal recent volatility.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Bankruptcy Concerns:** Multiple articles highlight concerns about iRobot's potential bankruptcy.
*   **Failed Acquisition:** The stock tumbled because iRobot couldn't find a buyer.
*   **Earnings Reports:** Recent earnings snapshots indicate continued challenges.

**Analysis of News:** The news flow is overwhelmingly negative, dominated by concerns about financial stability and the inability to find a buyer. This negative sentiment is likely weighing heavily on the stock price.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** None
*   **Opinions:** 1
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 11.94 / 11.94 / 11.94

**Analysis of Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Limited Consensus:** The absence of a consensus rating and the presence of only one opinion suggest that analysts are hesitant to provide recommendations, likely due to the company's uncertain future.
*   **High Target Price:** The high target price of $11.94, compared to the current price of $1.5, indicates that the analyst sees substantial upside potential, but this should be taken with caution given the company's struggles and negative news flow.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.15B  | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.13B  | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.10B  | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B  | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.19B  | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE       |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $-0.03B  | 80.07%    |
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.01B  | 296.52%   |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B  | 11005.42% |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B   | -125.91%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B   | -4.24%    |

**Analysis of Financial Information:**

*   **Negative Equity:** The negative equity in recent quarters is a major concern, indicating that the company's liabilities exceed its assets.
*   **High ROE:** The exceptionally high Return on Equity (ROE) values are misleading due to the negative equity.  ROE is calculated as net income divided by equity, so with negative equity, the values become distorted and not indicative of actual profitability.
*   **Declining Revenue:** Although profit margins are relatively high, the declining revenue trend is a significant warning sign.

**7. Overall Summary**

iRobot Corp. (IRBT) is currently facing significant challenges.  The company has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, has negative equity, declining revenue, and is the subject of bankruptcy concerns in the news. While the RSI indicates an oversold condition and there was a recent price bump, the overall picture is highly concerning. The consensus among analysts appears to be limited, reflecting uncertainty about the company's future. **Given the high level of risk and negative indicators, caution is strongly advised.  The company's financial health needs to improve significantly to warrant any investment.**
