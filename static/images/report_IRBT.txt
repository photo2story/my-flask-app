IRBT is facing significant challenges. The company has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500.  The recent news suggests potential business developments or regulatory changes.

Investors should exercise extreme caution and closely monitor the company's financial performance and news releases. The Hybrid Signal confirms this cautious stance.
