2025-11-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of iRobot Corp (IRBT) based on the data you provided.

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** iRobot Corp. designs, builds, and sells robots, primarily known for its Roomba vacuum cleaner.
*   **IRBT Cumulative Return:** -86.59%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 94.64%
*   **Divergence:** -181.2 (Relative Divergence: 0.6)

**Analysis:**

*   IRBT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined. The cumulative return is drastically negative, while the S&P 500 has delivered substantial positive returns.
*   The divergence of -181.2 indicates a substantial difference in performance. The relative divergence of 0.6 suggests the current divergence is near the bottom of its historical range.
*   The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals some interesting trends over different periods.
    *   From 2015-2018, iRobot showed strong CAGR and positive Alpha, indicating outperformance relative to its risk (Beta). However, it came with high MDD (Maximum Drawdown), indicating high volatility.
    *   Starting 2017-2019, iRobot's performance plummeted, with negative CAGR and significantly negative Alpha, suggesting underperformance even considering its risk. This trend continues through 2023-2025.
    *   The Beta values generally indicate the stock is more volatile than the market (Beta > 1), and have decreased to negative values.
    *   The decreasing Cap (B) suggests a shrinking market capitalization over the analyzed periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 1.5
*   **Last-market:** Price: 1.5, Previous Close: 1.42, Change: 5.63%
*   **5-day SMA:** 1.62
*   **20-day SMA:** 2.3895
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.4344

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This suggests a downtrend.
*   The recent price increase (5.63% change) is a positive sign, but it's important to see if it holds.
*   The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day SMA suggests a considerable decline in the stock price over the past few months.

**3) RSI, PPO, Market Risk Indicator, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 13.42
*   **PPO:** -4.50
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (250 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -11852.9%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.8 indicates a medium level of investment risk, according to its scale.
*   The RSI of 13.42 is extremely oversold, suggesting the stock *could* be due for a rebound (although oversold conditions can persist for extended periods).
*   The PPO of -4.50 indicates that the short-term moving average is significantly below the long-term moving average, confirming the downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal is contradictory to MRI, but suggests a full investment approach within the given model, albeit with a focus on "Very Safe" stocks and indicating a high MRI of 0.90.
*   The very negative expected return of -11852.9% is alarming and indicates that, based on the model's calculations, long-term investment from this point is expected to result in significant losses compared to the S&P 500.
*   The change in relative divergence shows a short-term decline.
*   The significant price change suggests a strong reaction in the market.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   The news headlines paint a concerning picture:
    *   Fears of bankruptcy are resurfacing.
    *   A potential acquisition deal fell through.
    *   The stock price has tumbled significantly.
    *   Confidence in the company is lacking.
*   These headlines confirm the negative trends suggested by the other data points.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   The mean target price is $11.94, which is significantly higher than the current price. However, only one opinion is available. This target might be outdated.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B  | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B  | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B  | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B  | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B  | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE         |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B   | 80.07%      |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B   | 296.52%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B    | -125.91%    |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B    | -4.24%      |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue is generally declining, as seen in the previous section.
*   While profit margins appear high for the last quarters, it is a result of the negative equity position, so we should consider the profit margin as non-significant.
*   Most alarmingly, the company's equity has turned negative. This means the company has more liabilities than assets, which is a very serious financial situation.
*   The extremely high ROE (Return on Equity) values are meaningless and misleading due to the negative equity. ROE is calculated as Net Income / Shareholder's Equity. When Shareholder's Equity is negative, the calculation becomes distorted.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **iRobot (IRBT) is facing significant financial difficulties.** The stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500. Recent news suggests bankruptcy fears, a failed acquisition, and declining confidence. Earnings reports show consistent losses.
*   **The company's equity has turned negative, indicating severe financial distress.** The negative equity skews financial ratios like ROE, making them unreliable.
*   **Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest the stock is oversold, but this doesn't necessarily mean a sustained recovery is imminent.** Oversold conditions can persist, and the fundamental problems are overriding.
*   **Analyst coverage is limited, and the single available target price may be outdated and unreliable.**
*   **Based on the available data, an investment in iRobot appears very risky at this time.** The company faces fundamental challenges, and there are significant concerns about its long-term viability. The "expected return" metric is extremely negative.

**In conclusion, based on the data provided, it would be highly risky to invest in iRobot (IRBT) at this time.** A turnaround is possible, but would require significant positive changes in the company's financial performance and market outlook.
