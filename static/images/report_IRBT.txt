### 7. 종합 analysis

iRobot Corp (IRBT) faces significant challenges. The company's stock has substantially underperformed the S&P 500, as evidenced by the substantial negative cumulative return and deviation metrics. The negative alpha values and decreasing market capitalization confirm this underperformance and investor disinterest. Recent news indicates volatility and sensitivity to market events. The company reports negative EPS values, fluctuating revenues, and concerning negative equity values, pointing towards potential financial distress. While the Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a low-risk environment, and the recent change in relative deviation offers a glimmer of short-term optimism, the overwhelmingly negative expected return paints a grim long-term outlook. Based on this analysis, investing in IRBT appears high-risk.
