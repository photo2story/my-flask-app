**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Compound Annual Growth Rate shows strong growth in the early periods (2015-2018), followed by significant declines.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha values indicate underperformance relative to its benchmark (S&P 500).  The negative values are particularly concerning, suggesting poor risk-adjusted returns.
*   **Beta:** Low Beta values (around 0.1 in the early periods, slightly negative more recently) suggest the stock is less volatile than the market overall (this is somewhat counterintuitive given the large MDD, and probably reflects idiosyncratic risk).
*   **Cap (B):** Market Capitalization is decreasing over time, suggesting a loss of investor confidence and potentially signaling the bankruptcy of iRobot.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 0.4664 (Last Market: 0.4664, Change: 0.0)
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.2284
*   **20-day SMA:** 2.1454
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.8404

**Analysis:** The stock price is trading below all the moving averages, indicating a strong downtrend.  The drastic difference between the 5-day SMA and the longer-term SMAs suggests a recent rapid price decline.  The current price is very low and the change is 0.0, which means that the price has stabilized after some drastic drop or fluctuation.

**3) Indicators Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended - according to the provided scale, though context suggests extreme caution)
*   **RSI:** 26.93 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -18.04 (Significantly below 0, indicating a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1000 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -7.8 (단기하락 - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -12247.3%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The high MRI is HIGHLY CONTRADICTORY to the overall situation of the stock. DO NOT TRUST. The fact that it shows high investment recommended, it should be removed or revised.
*   **RSI:** The stock is heavily oversold, which *could* indicate a potential for a bounce, but in this context, it is more likely a continuation of the downtrend.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO confirms the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Buy Signal is HIGHLY CONTRADICTORY to the overall situation of the stock. DO NOT TRUST. The fact that it suggests to invest all the cash, it should be removed or revised.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The short-term decline reinforces the negative trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return highlights the substantial risks associated with investing in IRBT at this time.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B  | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B  | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B  | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B  | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B  | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE       |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B | 80.07%    |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B | 296.52%   |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B | 11005.42% |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B  | -125.91%  |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B  | -4.24%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue Trend:** Revenue has generally been decreasing from 2024-09-30 to 2025-03-31, followed by a recent uptick.
*   **Negative Equity:** The negative equity in recent quarters is a serious concern, indicating the company's liabilities exceed its assets.
*   **High ROE (on negative equity):** The extremely high ROE figures in recent quarters are misleading. ROE is calculated by dividing net income by equity. When equity is negative, even small losses can result in very large (and nonsensical) ROE values. These figures indicate severe financial distress, not profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

iRobot (IRBT) is in severe financial distress and has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, and its financial metrics reveal a deteriorating situation with negative equity, declining revenue, and consistent losses. Recent news confirms the bankruptcy filing, and the analyst target price is no longer relevant. The company's fundamentals are weak, and the technical indicators point to a strong downtrend.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in IRBT at this point is extremely risky. The bankruptcy filing suggests a high probability of significant losses for shareholders. The information provided suggests a "sell" or "avoid" recommendation. The few positive indicators provided by MRI and Hybrid Signal are suspicious and likely should not be trusted.
