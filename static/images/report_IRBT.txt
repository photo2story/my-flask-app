**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B  | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B  | 20.00%        |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B  | 32.25%        |
| 2024-06-30   | $0.17B  | 16.51%        |

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE          |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B   | 296.52%      |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** Revenue fluctuates, with a generally positive, but not consistently increasing profit margin.
*   **Equity & ROE:** Equity has turned negative, which is a significant concern. ROE (Return on Equity) is extremely volatile and unrealistically high when equity is near zero or negative, rendering it meaningless.

**7. Overall Summary:**

iRobot (IRBT) is facing significant challenges. The company has severely underperformed the S&P 500, has negative earnings and fluctuating revenue. Recent positive news related to AI Roomba and earnings beats provides some hope, but the negative equity and expected return are major concerns. Recent price action suggests the stock is very volatile. The mixed analyst opinion and the small sample size should also be noted. A low investment or complete avoidance strategy may be warranted at this time.
