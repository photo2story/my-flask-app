2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of iRobot (IRBT) based on the provided data, broken down as requested:

**0) Overview:**

*   **IRBT Cumulative Return:** -98.06%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** -189.1 (Relative Divergence: 1.1)

**1) Comparative Return Analysis & Company Overview:**

*   **Company Overview:** iRobot Corp. designs, manufactures, and sells robots, notably the Roomba vacuum cleaner.
*   **Return Disparity:** IRBT significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). IRBT lost almost all of its value whereas VOO nearly doubled.
*   **Divergence Analysis:** The divergence of -189.1 indicates a very large negative gap between IRBT's and VOO's performance. The relative divergence of 1.1 suggests this negative divergence is near its worst level observed in the data.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The table shows consistently negative Alpha values across different periods, meaning IRBT underperformed relative to its risk (Beta). Beta generally hovers around 1, indicating market-like sensitivity, but the strongly negative Alphas coupled with large MDDs suggest the stock's performance is significantly worse than the market's in those periods. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a particularly sharp decline with a high MDD and largely negative Alpha, likely impacted by recent events.
    **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows that the company has failed to maintain any kind of consistent profitability.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $0.1199
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $0.1199, Previous Close: $0.0, Change: $0.0
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 0.1257
    *   20-day SMA: 1.6489
    *   60-day SMA: 2.538
*   **SMA Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is well below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a recent sharp decline in price.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended) -  This is somewhat misleading given the recent news. The MRI is likely lagging and does not fully reflect the bankruptcy situation.
*   **RSI:** 0.269 (Oversold) - The RSI indicates the stock is heavily oversold.
*   **PPO:** -15.96 (Bearish) - The PPO confirms a strong downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70)" - The signal suggests a small buy, but with caution, influenced by the MRI which, again, may be outdated.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 1.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase) - The recent relative divergence change indicates a short-term rise, suggesting a possible (but potentially short-lived) bounce.
*   **Price Change Note:** The price data suggests the market is volatile, given the comparison to the previous close.
*   **Expected Return:** -10489.9% - This extremely negative expected return suggests a very bleak outlook for the stock.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Bankruptcy Filing:** iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
*   **Sale to Chinese Company:** The company is being sold to a Chinese company.
*   **Debt and Competition:** Debt and competition are cited as reasons for the bankruptcy.
*   **Short-Seller Perspective:** A short-seller highlights how they identified iRobot as a bearish target.
*   **Stock Price Collapse:** The stock price has collapsed as a result of the bankruptcy filing.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Weak.
*   **Target Price:** $11.94 (Single Analyst) -  This is *highly* outdated and irrelevant given the current situation.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** iRobot is in a dire situation, having filed for bankruptcy and being sold. Its stock has plummeted, drastically underperforming the S&P 500. Recent news confirms the fundamental problems (debt, competition) leading to this point.
*   **Technical Indicators:** While the RSI suggests the stock is oversold and there might be a short-term bounce, the overall trend (PPO, moving averages) is strongly bearish. The MRI is likely outdated and shouldn't be relied upon.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** The single remaining analyst target price is no longer relevant.
*   **Recommendation:** **Avoid.** Investing in IRBT at this point is exceptionally risky. The bankruptcy filing introduces substantial uncertainty, and any potential gains are purely speculative and unlikely to be realized. The "short-term rise" suggested by the recent relative divergence is likely a dead cat bounce and shouldn't be interpreted as a sign of recovery.
*   **Impact of News:** The news items confirm a complete collapse of the business. The extremely negative expected return reflects this reality. The sale of the company, while potentially offering *some* value to shareholders, is unlikely to result in a significant return at the current price.
