| 2024-06-30   | $0.15B     | -47.39%     |

**Analysis:** The revenue has fluctuated over the past year, with the most recent quarter at $0.13B and a profit margin of 30.02%. Notably, the company's equity has turned negative in the most recent quarters, while the ROE shows extremely high values, likely due to the negative equity. This financial situation requires careful monitoring, as negative equity can indicate financial distress.

### 7. Overall Assessment

Based on the provided data, IRBT presents a high-risk investment. Key concerns include:

*   **Significant Underperformance:**  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Profitability:**  Consistent negative EPS and fluctuating revenues raise concerns about the company's ability to generate sustainable profits.
*   **High Volatility:**  High Maximum Drawdown values indicate substantial price swings.
*   **Negative Equity:** The negative equity and highly fluctuating ROE indicate financial instability.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Returns:** The projected underperformance against the S&P 500 is a major red flag.

While recent news of positive earnings reports and new product launches offer some hope, the fundamental financial challenges and market underperformance warrant extreme caution.  The single analyst target price of $11.94 should be viewed with skepticism given the overall negative outlook. The MRI indicates medium risk, but the other factors suggest a potentially higher risk level.
