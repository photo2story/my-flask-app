|------------|--------|-------|----------|------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | -100.0%| 97.3% | -168.0% | 1.6  | 0.0    |

**Analysis:** The table shows a dramatic decline in iRobot's performance over time.  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has become increasingly negative. Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is very high, indicating significant risk. Alpha is consistently negative, indicating underperformance relative to its risk. Beta fluctuates, showing varying sensitivity to market movements, but trending downwards.  The company's market capitalization (Cap) has dwindled to virtually zero.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 0.11
*   **Last-market:** price: 0.11, previousClose: 0.0, change: 0.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.13
*   **20-day SMA:** 1.81
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.61

**Analysis:** The current price is significantly below the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a strong downward trend. While the 5-day SMA is slightly higher than the current price, the large gap between the short-term SMA and longer-term SMAs further reinforces the negative trend. The last market information of previousClose of 0.0 and change of 0.0 indicates a halt in trading.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended; but this is HIGHLY questionable given the other data)
*   **RSI:** 0.06
*   **PPO:** -16.81
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-15)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.7 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis:** The RSI of 0.06 indicates the stock is heavily oversold. The negative PPO suggests a bearish trend.  The Hybrid Signal is recommending to buy, albeit with caution. The MRI score is HIGHLY SUSPECT given the company's bankruptcy filing.  The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward movement, possibly a "dead cat bounce." The expected return of 0.0% is not promising for long-term investment.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Key News:**
    *   iRobot Announces Strategic Transaction to Drive Long-Term Growth Plan
    *   iRobot Bankruptcy: How Debt and Competition Crushed Its Stock
    *   iRobot, the maker of Roomba vacuums, files for bankruptcy and sells itself to Chinese company

    *   iRobot stock price collapses as Roomba maker files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy: Here's what happens next

**Analysis:** The news headlines paint a clear picture: iRobot has filed for bankruptcy (Chapter 11) and is being sold to a Chinese company. This explains the dramatic stock price decline and is the most important factor in assessing the company's future. The article mentioning "investors chasing shares higher" likely refers to speculative trading following the bankruptcy news, not a fundamental improvement in the company's outlook.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** None
*   **Mean:** -
*   **Opinions:** 1
*   **Target Price:** 11.94 / 11.94 / 11.94

**Analysis:** The consensus analyst opinion is not available, likely due to the recent bankruptcy. There is a single analyst target price of 11.94, but this target is likely outdated and irrelevant given the bankruptcy proceedings.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.62  | 0.15 B$  |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.68  | 0.13 B$  |
| 2025-05-06 | -2.84  | 0.10 B$  |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21  | 0.19 B$  |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21  | 0.19 B$  |

**Analysis:** The earnings data shows consistently negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) and fluctuating revenue.  The large negative EPS figures, particularly in 2025-05-06, indicate significant losses. While there is a small bounce back in revenue from 0.10B to 0.19B, the persistent losses highlight the company's financial struggles and ultimately culminated in the bankruptcy filing. Duplication of 2024-11-06 and 2025-11-06 needs to be clarified in original source.

**6) Financial Information**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.15B | 31.03% |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.13B | 30.02% |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.10B | 20.00% |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B | 9.54% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.19B | 32.25% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-09-30 | $-0.03B | 80.07% |
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.01B | 296.52% |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B | 11005.42% |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B | -125.91% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B | -4.24% |

**Analysis:** The data displays a concerning trend. While revenue shows some fluctuation, the key issue is the rapid erosion of equity into negative territory. The Return on Equity (ROE) figures are meaningless when equity is negative, as it's a result of dividing by a negative number (negative equity). These financial figures further underscore the company's insolvency and the inevitability of bankruptcy.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

The analysis of iRobot (IRBT) presents a dire situation. The company has filed for bankruptcy, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. Its stock price has collapsed, and its financial statements reveal a company with dwindling equity and persistent losses.

*   **Bankruptcy:** The most crucial factor is the bankruptcy filing. This fundamentally changes the investment thesis and significantly increases risk.
*   **Financial Distress:** Negative earnings, declining equity, and high debt levels all contributed to the bankruptcy.
*   **Market Underperformance:** IRBT has lagged the S&P 500 significantly, indicating poor investment returns.
*   **Technical Indicators:** While the RSI suggests the stock is oversold, this may simply be a reflection of the bankruptcy news and doesn't necessarily indicate a buying opportunity.
*   **Analyst Outlook:** Analyst opinions are likely outdated and unreliable given the current circumstances.

**Conclusion:** Investing in IRBT at this point is highly speculative and carries extreme risk. The bankruptcy proceedings will likely result in significant losses for shareholders. The potential for a short-term bounce should be considered in the context of the overwhelming evidence of financial distress and the inherent risks associated with bankruptcy. The MRI indicator is likely inaccurate given the situation. Due diligence and caution are highly advised before making any investment decisions.
