**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** Revenue has generally declined, although profit margins have been volatile.
*   **Equity & ROE:** The negative equity in recent quarters is alarming and signals financial distress. The high ROE values during periods of negative equity are misleading and should be disregarded, since negative equity skews the ratios.

iRobot (IRBT) is facing severe financial challenges. The company has filed for bankruptcy, is experiencing declining revenues, consistently negative earnings, and negative equity. The stock has drastically underperformed the market, and analyst sentiment is weak. Technical indicators suggest a strong downtrend. While there is some mention of a strategic transaction to drive long-term growth, the overall outlook is highly uncertain and risky. Investing in IRBT at this time would be extremely speculative.
