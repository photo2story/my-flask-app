*   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms short-term negative momentum.

*   **Equity:**  Equity has turned negative in recent quarters, indicating severe financial distress. Negative equity suggests liabilities exceed assets.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) is extremely volatile and unreliable due to the negative equity. The large positive ROE values are mathematically distorted and do not reflect a healthy business.

**7. Comprehensive Summary**

Based on the data provided, iRobot (IRBT) is facing significant financial difficulties.  The company is underperforming the market significantly, showing negative growth, and experiencing substantial losses. The potential bankruptcy news is a major concern.  While the RSI indicates an oversold condition and the MRI suggests investment, the overwhelming weight of evidence points to a very high-risk situation.  The negative equity, inconsistent revenue, and negative analyst target price make this an extremely speculative and potentially dangerous investment.

**Recommendation:**  Avoid investing in IRBT at this time. The risk of further losses is very high. Closely monitor the company's financial situation and news flow for any signs of improvement, but be prepared for potential bankruptcy. Any investment decision should be made with extreme caution and a full understanding of the risks involved.
