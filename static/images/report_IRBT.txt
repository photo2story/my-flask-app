| 2023-2025  | -5.0%   | 85.8%  | -72.0%  | -0.1  | 0.1    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The historical CAGR is overwhelmingly negative in recent periods, indicating significant losses for investors.
*   **MDD:**  High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values across all periods indicate substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Negative alpha consistently means IRBT has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Beta values around 0 suggest IRBT's price movements have not been strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500).  The negative Betas for the later years suggest an *inverse* correlation, but the values are small.
*   **Cap:** The market capitalization has decreased dramatically in recent years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 5.24
*   **Last Market Data:** Price = 4.32, Previous Close = 5.0, Change = -13.6%
*   **5-day SMA:** 3.732
*   **20-day SMA:** 2.307
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.2823

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below the previous close, indicating a recent downturn. The negative change (-13.6%) highlights a significant drop in the last market session.
*   The 5-day SMA is higher than the 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 60-day SMA, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend *after* a longer-term decline.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 79.87 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 14.76
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (6 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 5.4 (+) - Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return:** -2038.9%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A Medium Investment rating suggests moderate risk based on the underlying indicators used in its calculation.
*   **RSI:**  The RSI is high, indicating the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction.
*   **PPO:**  A positive PPO suggests the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicative of potential upward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The 'Buy' signal contradicts other data, probably due to recent rebound momentum.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence supports the short-term upward movement indicated by the PPO and SMAs.
*   **Expected Return:** The severely negative expected return indicates a very pessimistic long-term outlook based on current conditions.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Short-Squeeze Frenzy, Bankruptcy Risk:**  This headline highlights the volatile nature of the stock, driven by short-squeeze speculation, alongside the real possibility of bankruptcy.
*   **Valuation After Robotics Order Hype:**  Suggests that recent price surges may be based on hype rather than fundamental value.
*   **Retail Investors Think It's A New Short-Squeeze:**  Reinforces the short-squeeze speculation.
*   **Float Is Being Sold Short:**  Indicates a large number of investors are betting against the stock.
*   **Shares Rebound: Buying Opportunity?:** This headline conflicts with much of the other data.

**Analysis:** The news headlines paint a very risky picture, dominated by short-squeeze speculation, bankruptcy concerns, and questions about the sustainability of recent price increases.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 3.00 (Hold)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 1
*   **Target Price:** 11.94
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  None

**Analysis:**

*   The analyst consensus is "Hold," with a target price of $11.94. Given the current price of ~$4, this represents a significant potential upside *if* the analyst's assessment is correct. However, with only one opinion available, the reliability is questionable.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.15B   | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.13B   | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.10B   | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B   | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.19B   | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE        |
|------------|------------|------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $-0.03B   | 80.07%     |
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.01B   | 296.52%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B    | -125.91%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B    | -4.24%     |

**Analysis:**

*   While profit margins appear positive, the *negative* Equity and wildly fluctuating (and often meaningless) ROE figures indicate a seriously distressed financial situation. Negative equity suggests that the company's liabilities exceed its assets, which is a critical concern. The ROE figures are meaningless due to the negative equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

iRobot (IRBT) presents a high-risk investment opportunity.  The company has significantly underperformed the broader market, demonstrated by a large negative divergence compared to the S&P 500. The negative alpha and decreasing market capitalization further confirm its poor performance.

Recent news highlights a volatile situation, driven by short-squeeze speculation and bankruptcy risk.  While there's been a recent price rebound and short-term SMA trends are positive, the RSI indicates the stock is overbought, and this short-term gain has followed a significant decline. The analyst consensus is "Hold," with a significantly higher target price, but with only one opinion, this is not very trustworthy.

Earnings reports show consistent losses, declining revenues, and seriously concerning financial metrics like negative equity.

**Overall, investing in IRBT carries substantial risk, and any potential gains appear largely driven by speculative short-squeeze potential rather than fundamental strength.** The very negative expected return reflects this pessimistic outlook. While the MRI suggests a "Medium Investment," this seems to be outweighed by the many other negative indicators. A very careful and risk-tolerant investor might consider a small position, but only with a full understanding of the very high potential for significant losses.
