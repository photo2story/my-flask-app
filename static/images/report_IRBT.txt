*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 3.72
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 3.20

**Analysis:** The stock price has declined recently, as indicated by the negative change and the current price being below the 5-day moving average. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which *could* indicate short-term upward momentum, but the recent price drop is a concern. The significant drop from the previous close suggests potential negative news or market sentiment impacting the stock.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (3 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)

*   **Expected Return (%):** -3545.2%

**Analysis:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests low market risk. However, the RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting the stock might be due for a pullback. The PPO being positive suggests that there is an upward trend in the short term. The hybrid signal, while suggesting a "Buy", includes a caution flag and a low cash ratio. The positive change in relative divergence over the past 20 days indicates short-term improvement relative to the S&P 500. However, the extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, indicating potentially severe long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if a buy-and-hold strategy is employed. The last price info({'price': 4.48, 'previousClose': 4.64, 'change': -3.45}) is showing negative change, which can cause a short-term issue.
