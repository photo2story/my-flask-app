*   **Thin Analyst Coverage:** Only one analyst opinion available, though it suggests substantial upside.

**Recommendation:**  The data strongly suggests avoiding investment in IRBT at this time. The negative financials, poor performance, and negative outlook outweigh the potential upside suggested by the single analyst target price. Close monitoring and further research would be necessary to reconsider this recommendation in the future.
