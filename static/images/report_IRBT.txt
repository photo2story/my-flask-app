| 2023-2025  | -17.0%  | 85.8%  | -81.0%  | -0.1   | 0.1    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  CAGR values are strongly negative in recent periods, indicating poor long-term growth.
*   **MDD:**  High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) across all periods demonstrates substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to the market risk-free rate, even considering the risk taken.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low (close to 0), suggesting that IRBT is not strongly correlated with the overall market, and recent periods show even lower beta, indicating reduced market sensitivity.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has been decreasing over the years.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 4.15
*   **Last Market Change:** Price decreased slightly (-0.12%) compared to the previous close.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day MA: 4.216
    *   20-day MA: 3.9035
    *   60-day MA: 3.8938

**Analysis:** The price is below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend but potential medium-term stabilization. The minor price decrease in the last market suggests a minor fluctuation.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 44.8 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 1.4479 (Positive - suggesting a potential uptrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (250 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **20-day Relative Deviation Change:** 1.8 (+) - Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative performance.
*   **Expected Return:** -6199.1% (Extremely negative - significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 is expected over a 2+ year period).

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk, but the extremely negative expected return is a major concern.
*   The hybrid signal suggests to buy due to safety, but that signal does not reflect the full picture.
*   While the PPO and recent relative deviation change indicate potential short-term upward momentum, the long-term outlook is bleak based on the expected return.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative News:**
    *   Famed roboticist says humanoid robot bubble is doomed to burst. This is a general industry concern that could affect sentiment.
*   **Neutral/Positive News:**
    *   Reports on the Cleaning Robot Global Market highlight growth opportunities.
    *   Smart Robots Company Evaluation mentions iRobot as a leader.
    *   iRobot's Q2 2025 Earnings Beat Expectations (though details are needed to assess the quality of the beat).

**Analysis:** Recent news is mixed. While some reports point to growth in the robotics market, a general warning about a "humanoid robot bubble" and the dependence of iRobot on the cleaning robot market pose significant threats.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Neutral.
*   **Target Price:** 11.94 (Significantly higher than the current price of 4.15).
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** None.

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, see significant upside potential based on the target price. However, the lack of recent rating changes and the neutral consensus suggest caution.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |

| 2025-06-30 | $0.13B  | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.10B  | 20.00%        |

| 2024-06-30 | $0.17B  | 16.51%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE        |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.01B   | 296.52%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B    | -125.91%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B    | -4.24%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.15B    | -47.39%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:**  Revenue has been fluctuating.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have fluctuated, with the most recent quarter showing an increased margin.
*   **Equity:**  Equity has turned negative in the two most recent quarters, a major red flag. This indicates the company's liabilities exceed its assets.
*   **ROE:** Extremely high ROE values in the negative equity quarters are meaningless and a direct consequence of the negative equity.  The ROE was negative in prior periods.

**7. Overall Assessment:**

Based on the information provided, iRobot (IRBT) presents a high-risk investment opportunity.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   Consistent losses (negative EPS).
    *   Negative equity and highly fluctuating ROE.
    *   Extremely negative expected return (suggesting continued underperformance).
    *   Concerns about a potential "humanoid robot bubble."
*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   Recent earnings beat expectations (though further investigation is needed).
    *   Positive, though fluctuating, profit margins.
    *   Analysts see significant upside potential (but their opinions are dated).
    *   The company is mentioned as a leader in some robotics market reports.
*   **Neutral Factors:**
    *   MRI suggests a moderate level of risk, but this might be misleading.
    *   RSI is neutral.
    *   PPO and recent relative deviation indicate short-term upward momentum, but this is outweighed by longer-term concerns.

**Conclusion:**

While there might be some short-term trading opportunities based on recent price action and analyst target prices, the fundamental challenges facing iRobot, particularly its negative equity, consistent losses, and negative expected return, make it a very risky investment.  A significant turnaround strategy would need to be identified and implemented to justify a long-term investment.
