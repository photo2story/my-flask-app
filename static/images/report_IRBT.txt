**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 77.0%   | 67.0%   | 48.0%   | 0.1    | 8.1    |
| 2016-2018  | 69.0%   | 74.9%   | 54.0%   | 0.1    | 8.8    |
| 2017-2019  | -68.0%  | 74.9%   | -90.0%  | 0.2    | 5.3    |
| 2018-2020  | -62.0%  | 75.9%   | -86.0%  | 0.1    | 8.5    |
| 2019-2021  | -90.0%  | 75.9%   | -136.0% | 0.1    | 7.0    |
| 2020-2022  | -29.0%  | 75.9%   | -28.0%  | -0.3   | 5.1    |
| 2021-2023  | -142.0% | 75.5%   | -143.0% | -0.2   | 4.1    |
| 2022-2024  | -69.0%  | 85.8%   | -89.0%  | -0.3   | 0.8    |
| 2023-2025  | -51.0%  | 90.3%   | -119.0% | -0.1   | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been predominantly negative in recent periods, coupled with extremely high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures. This indicates significant losses and high volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Negative Alpha values consistently indicate that iRobot has underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) after accounting for risk. The magnitude of the negative Alpha has been substantial, particularly in recent years.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low (close to zero), suggesting that iRobot's price movements have been relatively independent of the overall market. The negative Beta in later years suggests a slight inverse relationship with the market.
*   **Cap(B):**  The Market Capitalization (Cap(B)) has decreased significantly over the period, nearing zero. This reflects a dramatic loss of investor confidence and market value.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 0.1405
*   **Last Market Price:** 0.4664 (no change from previous close)
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.2284
*   **20-day SMA:** 2.1454
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.8404

**Analysis:** The stock price is trading far below its short-term (5-day) and longer-term (20-day, 60-day) moving averages, indicating a strong downtrend. The recent close is also extremely low. The Last Market Price shows no change, likely reflecting a halt in trading.

**3) Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - **Important Caveat:**  While the MRI suggests high investment, this should be disregarded given the bankruptcy news and other negative indicators. The MRI may be a lagging indicator or not fully capture the current distressed situation.
*   **RSI:** 26.93 -  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below 30, suggesting the stock is oversold. This *could* indicate a potential for a short-term bounce, but in this context, it more likely reflects sustained selling pressure.
*   **PPO:** -18.04 - The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) being significantly negative reinforces the downtrend and indicates strong bearish momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1000 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01) - **Important Caveat:** This signal is likely unreliable and should be ignored given the current situation. The algorithm appears to be incorrectly interpreting the data.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -7.8 (단기하락) -  A negative change in relative divergence confirms a short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -12247.3 -  This extremely negative expected return reinforces the dire situation and suggests very high risk.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Headlines:** The news is overwhelmingly negative:
    *   "iRobot Announces Strategic Transaction to Drive Long-Term Growth Plan" - This could be a sign of restructuring, but needs careful evaluation.
    *   "iRobot Bankruptcy: How Debt and Competition Crushed Its Stock"
    *   "iRobot Files Chapter 11: What Happens to IRBT Stock Now?"
    *   "iRobot stock price collapses as Roomba maker files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy"

**Analysis:** The news is dominated by reports of bankruptcy filing (Chapter 11). This is a critical development that significantly impacts the stock's value and future prospects. The strategic transaction news is likely related to the bankruptcy proceedings.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:**  Limited data. One opinion available.
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 11.94 / 11.94 / 11.94 - **Important Caveat:** This target price is likely outdated and irrelevant given the bankruptcy filing. Analyst opinions prior to the bankruptcy news are no longer reliable indicators.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출        |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.62 | 0.15 B$     |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.68 | 0.13 B$     |
| 2025-05-06 | -2.84 | 0.10 B$     |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$     |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$     |

**Analysis:** The company has consistently reported negative Earnings Per Share (EPS) and declining revenue over the past several quarters. The significant loss in 2025-05-06 is particularly concerning. This trend indicates financial distress.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.15B  | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.13B  | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.10B  | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B  | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.19B  | 32.25%        |

**Analysis:** While the profit margins appear relatively high, the declining revenue trend is a major concern. The high profit margins in the face of declining revenue could indicate cost-cutting measures that might not be sustainable in the long run.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE         |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $-0.03B   | 80.07%      |
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.01B   | 296.52%     |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B    | -125.91%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B    | -4.24%      |

**Analysis:** The negative equity in recent quarters is a critical red flag. It indicates that the company's liabilities exceed its assets, confirming its insolvency. The extremely high ROE figures are meaningless in this context, as they are calculated on a negative equity base.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

iRobot (IRBT) is in a severely distressed financial situation. The company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, its stock price has collapsed, and its financial metrics (negative equity, declining revenue, negative EPS) paint a grim picture. While the MRI indicator might suggest high investment, this is misleading and should be disregarded in light of the overwhelming negative evidence. The analyst target price is also likely outdated and irrelevant. **Investing in IRBT at this point would be extremely risky and is not recommended.** The news headlines confirm the bankruptcy and highlight the factors contributing to the company's downfall (debt and competition). The negative expected return (-12247.3%) is a strong indicator of the potential for further losses.
