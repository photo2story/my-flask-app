**Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**

*   **Negative Alpha:** The Alpha values are consistently negative, indicating that IRBT has significantly underperformed relative to its risk-adjusted expected return over various periods. In simpler terms, it hasn't delivered returns commensurate with its risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, often close to zero or even negative, suggesting that IRBT's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500).
*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is mostly negative, indicating a decline in the stock's value over most of the examined periods.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant potential for losses from peak to trough during the specified periods.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** $3.48
*   **Previous Close:** $3.44
*   **Change:** 1.16% (Slight positive movement)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 3.68
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 3.6225
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 3.8978

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The recent small positive change is not enough to reverse this trend based on the data provided.

### 3. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended). **Note:**  This seems counterintuitive given the other negative indicators. The MRI might be factoring in other elements not explicitly provided.
*   **RSI:** 53.36 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.5654 (Slightly bearish, indicating the price is below its moving average)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (54 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)" - This is an aggressive buy signal, contradicting other negative indicators. It likely depends heavily on the high MRI score.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** -2.2 (Indicates a short-term downward trend in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -7519.0% (Extremely negative – suggests significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon)
*   **Price Change Consideration:** The positive price change of 1.16% from the previous close suggests a small, recent upward movement. However, this needs to be considered in the context of the longer-term negative trends indicated by other metrics.

### 6. Financial Information

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B    | 30.02%         |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B    | 20.00%         |

| 2024-06-30   | $0.17B    | 16.51%         |

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE        |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B   | 296.52%    |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B    | -125.91%   |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B    | -4.24%     |
| 2024-06-30   | $0.15B    | -47.39%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are positive but vary significantly across quarters.
*   **Negative Equity:** Recent negative equity is a significant concern, suggesting financial distress.
*   **Volatile ROE:** The extremely high and fluctuating Return on Equity (ROE) values, particularly the large positive values when equity is negative, are misleading and should be disregarded. The negative ROE values when equity is positive indicate poor profitability relative to equity.

### 7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)

Based on the provided data, IRBT appears to be a risky investment with significant challenges:

*   **Underperformance:**  Substantially underperforming the S&P 500, with a very negative expected return over the long term.
*   **Unprofitability:** Consistent losses (negative EPS) and recent negative equity raise concerns about the company's financial health and long-term viability.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The MRI and Hybrid Signal suggest buying, but other indicators like PPO and relative divergence point to a downtrend. The aggressive buy signal from the Hybrid Signal seems inconsistent with the overall negative picture.
*   **Analyst Opinion:** Limited analyst coverage with only one target price available.
*   **News Events:** The news articles are a mixed bag. The negative humanoid robot article could negatively impact general robotics sentiment.
*   **Recent Price Movement:** The small recent price increase is insufficient to outweigh the numerous negative indicators.

**Recommendation:**  Based on this data, a conservative approach is warranted. A "Buy" recommendation would be highly speculative. Further investigation is necessary to understand the reasons behind the high MRI score and the aggressive "Buy" hybrid signal before considering any investment. It is important to evaluate the company's plans to address its unprofitability and negative equity.
