### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 3.195
*   **Previous Close:** 3.045
*   **Change:** 4.93%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 4.331
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 4.277
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 3.8427

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. However, the recent 4.93% increase could signal a short-term rebound but need further confirmation.

### 3. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 42.82 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -2.33 (Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (250 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.2 (+) - Short term increase.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -5974.0% (Very Negative)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a relatively high investment recommendation (0.9), this reading should be viewed with caution given the very negative expected return.
*   **RSI:** A neutral RSI suggests no immediate overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that short-term moving averages are below long-term moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests allocating all cash to buy the stock, considering it relatively "safe" according to MRI but the "very safe" wording might be misleading.
*   **Recent price change:**  The provided price change of 4.93% indicates a significant single-day upward movement.  This suggests a potential short-term positive catalyst.
*   **Expected Return:** The extraordinarily negative expected return is a significant red flag.

### 4. Recent News & Events

*   **[2025-10-27] iRobot Stock Tumbles. It Can’t Find a Buyer:** Negative news indicating potential acquisition challenges.
*   **[2025-10-19] A Fresh Look at iRobot (IRBT) Valuation Following Short Squeeze and AI-Powered Product Launch:** Mixed signals. A short squeeze could lead to temporary price increases, while the AI product launch might be a positive long-term catalyst.

**Analysis:** Recent news is mixed. The failed acquisition is a significant negative. The AI Roomba launch generated a short-term positive reaction, but the long-term impact remains to be seen.

#### 4-2. Analyst Opinions

    *   Mean Rating:  No clear rating available.
    *   Number of Opinions: 1
    *   Target Price (avg/high/low): 11.94 / 11.94 / 11.94

| 2024-06-30   | $0.15B    | -47.39%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Fluctuating revenue suggests inconsistent sales performance.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins vary, but recent data shows some positive values.
*   **Equity:** Negative equity in recent quarters is a major red flag, indicating potential financial distress.
*   **ROE:** Extremely high ROE values are misleading due to the negative equity. Negative ROE in other periods reflects losses.

### 7. Overall Analysis and Recommendation

**Summary:**

*   **Poor Historical Performance:**  IRBT has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Financials:**  Negative EPS, fluctuating revenue, and negative equity are all concerning.
*   **Mixed News:** Recent news is a mix of positive (AI Roomba launch) and negative (failed acquisition).
*   **Conflicting Signals:**  The MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" rating, which contradicts the negative expected return and poor financials. This might be a result of looking at limited factors or a lagging indicator.
*   **Analyst Opinion:** Limited, with a single target price that may not reflect current realities.

**Recommendation:**

Given the negative financials, poor historical performance, and mixed news, a **STRONG SELL** or **AVOID** recommendation is warranted. The extraordinarily negative expected return and concerning equity situation outweigh any potential short-term gains from the AI Roomba launch or a potential short squeeze. The company appears to be facing significant challenges and may be at risk of further decline. The "High Investment Recommended" signal from the MRI should be disregarded in light of the other, more concerning data points.
