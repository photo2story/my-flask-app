*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 3.3742

*   **Analysis:** The price decreased from the previous close. The price is above all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), which is generally considered a bullish signal. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day, and the 20-day is above the 60-day, further supporting a short-term upward trend.

*   **RSI:** 71.2589
*   **PPO:** 1.7906

*   **Delta Previous Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.5 (Negative – Short-Term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -4507.9%

*   **Analysis:** The RSI (71.2589) is above 70, indicating that the stock might be overbought, which could lead to a price correction. The PPO (1.7906) being positive suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating upward momentum. The Hybrid Signal suggests a "Buy" signal using most available cash, but with caution due to the MRI, which, despite being in the 'Low Risk' range, is close to the 'Medium Risk' threshold. A recent relative divergence decrease signals short-term decline. The significantly negative expected return indicates that long-term investment is expected to underperform the S&P 500.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
| :----------- | :-------- | :------------ |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B    | 20.00%       |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B    | 9.54%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B    | 32.25%       |
| 2024-06-30   | $0.17B    | 16.51%       |
| 2024-03-31   | $0.15B    | 24.07%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE          |
| :----------- | :-------- | :----------- |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%    |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B    | -125.91%     |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B    | -4.24%       |
| 2024-06-30   | $0.15B    | -47.39%      |
| 2024-03-31   | $0.20B    | 4.22%        |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has fluctuated. Profit margins are positive, but show inconsistency.  The negative equity in 2025-03-31 is a major concern. While the ROE is exceptionally high for that quarter, it's likely due to the near-zero equity base, making it an unreliable indicator. ROE for other quarters is negative or low, reflecting profitability issues.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

iRobot (IRBT) is currently facing significant challenges. Its stock has substantially underperformed the market, profitability is inconsistent, and recent earnings data are concerning. The negative equity and large negative expected return raise red flags about the company's financial health and future prospects. While the technical indicators suggest a potential short-term upward movement, the overbought RSI indicates a risk of correction.

The recent news headlines suggest ongoing market attention and volatility, likely related to the company's struggles. The analyst discussions underscore the importance of carefully monitoring iRobot's developments.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, a cautious approach is warranted. While a short-term buy signal might be tempting, the fundamental issues and negative long-term outlook suggest that investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in IRBT. Further investigation into the specific reasons for the negative equity and the company's plans to address these issues is crucial.
