*   **Alpha:** Alpha is overwhelmingly negative, demonstrating significant underperformance relative to the market risk-free rate (adjusting for Beta).

*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** Market capitalization has shrunk significantly, especially in the last few years, suggesting low investor confidence.

**Analysis:** The data suggests that, over the periods analyzed, IRBT consistently underperformed the market. The negative Alpha figures, coupled with the high MDD, point to a risky investment profile during this time. The shrinking market cap confirms the stock's struggles.
