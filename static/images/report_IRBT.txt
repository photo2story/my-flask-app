**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|------|--------|

| 2019-2021  | -90.0%  | 75.9% | -136.0% | 0.1  | 7.2    |
| 2020-2022  | -29.0%  | 75.9% | -28.0% | -0.3  | 5.3    |
| 2021-2023  | -142.0% | 75.5% | -143.0% | -0.2  | 4.2    |
| 2022-2024  | -69.0%  | 85.8% | -89.0% | -0.3  | 0.8    |
| 2023-2025  | -51.0%  | 90.7% | -118.0% | -0.1  | 0.0    |

*   **Analysis:** The table paints a clear picture of declining performance.
    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has deteriorated significantly from positive returns in early periods to substantial negative returns in recent years.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk. In the most recent periods, MDD approaches or exceeds 90%, indicating a near-total loss from peak values.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha, which represents the excess return relative to a benchmark, is consistently negative, indicating underperformance. The negative alpha values are becoming increasingly severe, suggesting a growing inability to generate returns independent of market movements.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values are mostly around 0.1 or -0.3. It indicates that IRBT's price movements are not strongly correlated with the broader market (S&P 500). The shift to negative beta values in later periods suggests an inverse relationship.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has steadily declined over the years, with the latest data point indicating a market capitalization near zero.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 0.1351
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.1621
*   **20-day SMA:** 2.0732
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.7761

*   **Analysis:** The current price is significantly below all moving averages, especially the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This signifies a strong downtrend. The 5-day SMA being closer to the current price might indicate a very short-term stabilization or slight upward movement, but it's insufficient to reverse the overall negative trend.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 28.86 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -17.90
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1000 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -12306.4%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.9, suggesting "High Investment Recommended," is highly contradictory given the other indicators and news. This likely reflects a model attempting to find value in a deeply oversold stock, which is extremely high risk.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 28.86 confirms that the stock is oversold, which can sometimes suggest a potential for a rebound.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of -17.90 indicates a strong downtrend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends allocating 100% of available cash to purchasing 1000 shares, which is conflicting with the extremely negative financials and recent events.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** A recent decline indicates continued downward pressure.
    *   **Expected Return:** The massively negative expected return (-12306.4%) is a red flag, forecasting very poor future performance compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Key Headlines:**  All recent news revolves around iRobot filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
*   **Analysis:** The news is overwhelmingly negative and confirms the financial distress indicated by the other data. The bankruptcy filing raises serious concerns about the company's future viability and the value of its stock.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Limited data is available.
*   **Target Price:** The average target price of $11.94 is significantly higher than the current price of $0.1351. However, given the bankruptcy filing, this target price is likely outdated and irrelevant.
*   **Analysis:** Analyst ratings are likely to be rapidly changing given the recent news. Any existing ratings should be viewed with extreme caution.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **EPS:** The Earnings Per Share (EPS) is consistently negative and has worsened significantly in recent quarters.  This demonstrates a failure to generate profits.
    *   **Revenue:** Revenue has been declining or stagnating, indicating a lack of sales growth.

| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B    | -4.24%     |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue and Profit Margin:** The revenue data mirrors the EPS trends, showing a decline. However, the provided Profit Margins appear inconsistent with the reported net losses, potentially due to other factors affecting profitability that are not readily apparent from the provided data.
    *   **Equity and ROE:** The company's Equity has turned negative, indicating that its liabilities exceed its assets. This is a critical warning sign. The extremely high ROE percentages are also misleading, as they are calculated on negative equity. This renders them meaningless and further underscores the company's financial distress.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Based on the provided data, iRobot Corp. is in severe financial distress. The company has significantly underperformed the market, faces declining revenue and profitability, and has recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Key takeaways:

*   **Bankruptcy:** The bankruptcy filing is the most critical piece of information and suggests a high risk of further value loss for shareholders.
*   **Financial Distress:** Negative equity, declining revenue, and consistent losses demonstrate severe financial challenges.
*   **Technical Indicators:** While some indicators might suggest the stock is oversold, the underlying fundamentals and bankruptcy news outweigh any potential for a short-term rebound.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** Existing analyst ratings are likely outdated and should be disregarded.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided data, an investment in iRobot Corp. is **extremely high risk and not recommended.** The company's bankruptcy filing and weak financial position suggest a high likelihood of further value loss for shareholders.
