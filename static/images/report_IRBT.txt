2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the iRobot (IRBT) situation based on the provided data, followed by a comprehensive summary.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** iRobot Corp designs, builds, and sells robots, primarily known for its Roomba vacuum cleaners.
*   **IRBT Cumulative Return:** -98.06%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** Current: -190.4 (Relative Divergence: 0.6)

**Analysis:**

IRBT has severely underperformed the S&P 500.  The sheer magnitude of the negative return (-98.06%) indicates significant value destruction. The large negative divergence (-190.4) between IRBT and VOO highlights the stark difference in their performance. The relative divergence of 0.6 suggests that this underperformance is near the bottom of its historical range, which doesn't necessarily mean it will improve but simply reflects how far it has already fallen.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD  | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|------|----------|------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | 44.0%    | 38.8% | 41.0%    | 1.8  | 10.4   |
| 2017-2019  | -72.0%   | 63.4% | -89.0%   | 1.9  | 6.3    |
| 2018-2020  | -53.0%   | 65.1% | -74.0%   | 1.1  | 9.9    |
| 2019-2021  | -75.0%   | 65.1% | -118.0%  | 0.9  | 8.2    |
| 2020-2022  | -22.0%   | 78.9% | -21.0%   | 0.9  | 6.0    |
| 2021-2023  | -125.0%  | 72.6% | -126.0%  | 0.8  | 4.8    |
| 2022-2024  | -60.0%   | 84.2% | -80.0%   | 0.8  | 1.0    |
| 2023-2025  | -48.0%   | 97.9% | -110.0%  | 1.6  | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Negative CAGR:**  The consistently negative Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) across all periods underscores the persistent decline in shareholder value.
*   **High MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures are extremely high, indicating very large peak-to-trough declines.  This highlights the high volatility and risk associated with the stock.
*   **Negative Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha values imply that IRBT has underperformed its expected return based on its beta (market sensitivity).
*   **Beta:** The beta values (ranging from 0.8 to 1.9) indicate that IRBT's price has generally moved in the same direction as the market, but with varying degrees of volatility. Some period it has moved more volatile than S&P 500.
*   **Declining Cap:** The declining market capitalization ("Cap(B)") shows a significant shrinking of the company's value over time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $0.1199
*   **Last-market:** price': 0.11990000307559967, 'previousClose': 0.0, 'change': 0.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.1257
*   **20-day SMA:** 1.6489
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.538

**Analysis:**

The current price is *significantly* below both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).  The 5-day SMA is slightly above the current price, which indicates a possible very short-term stabilization or slight upward trend, but this is likely insignificant given the larger context. The "previousClose": 0.0, "change": 0.0" indicates a possible trading halt or a very unusual situation.

**3) Market Risk Indicator and Other Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 0.269 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -15.96 (Significantly Below Zero)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 0.6 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -11612.3%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI (0.8 - Medium Investment):** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk, although the recent news of bankruptcy significantly increases the actual risk.  This metric may be lagging and not fully reflect the current situation.
*   **RSI (0.269):**  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the stock is heavily oversold.  This *could* signal a potential for a short-term bounce, but in the context of bankruptcy, it's more likely a reflection of the stock's distressed state.
*   **PPO (-15.96):** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) being deeply negative confirms the strong downward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The buy signal based on quant models are NOT reflective of the current conditions due to bankruptcy.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The "Short-term increase" suggested by the divergence change contradicts the overwhelming negative outlook. This could be a temporary anomaly or "dead cat bounce."
*   **Expected Return (-11612.3%):** The staggeringly negative expected return essentially suggests that the model predicts further and massive losses, which aligns with the bankruptcy news.

**4) Recent News:**

The news headlines are overwhelmingly negative, all pointing to the company's bankruptcy filing:

*   iRobot Files Chapter 11
*   iRobot stock price collapses
*   Sale to Chinese company
*   Short seller's successful bet against IRBT

**Analysis:**

These headlines confirm the fundamental issues driving the stock's decline.  The bankruptcy filing is a critical event with potentially devastating consequences for shareholders. The sale to a Chinese company, if it proceeds, may offer *some* recovery for creditors, but it's unlikely to benefit current shareholders significantly.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell): - (~-)
*   Opinions: 1
*   Target Price (avg/high/low): 11.94 / 11.94 / 11.94

**Analysis:**
Analyst opinions and target prices are likely outdated and irrelevant given the recent bankruptcy filing. The single target price of $11.94 is almost certainly no longer achievable.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |
|------------|--------|----------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.62  | 0.15 B$  |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.68  | 0.13 B$  |
| 2025-05-06 | -2.84  | 0.10 B$  |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21  | 0.19 B$  |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21  | 0.19 B$  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Consistently Negative EPS:**  The Earnings Per Share (EPS) has been consistently negative, and significantly so in some quarters (e.g., -2.84).
*   **Declining Revenue:** Revenue appears to be trending downward, indicating weakening sales.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.15B  | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.13B  | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.10B  | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.17B  | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.19B  | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE         |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $-0.03B   | 80.07%      |
| 2025-06-30 | $-0.01B   | 296.52%     |
| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B    | -125.91%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.15B    | -4.24%      |

**Analysis:**

*   **Declining Revenue:** While profit margins can appear healthy in some quarters, the declining revenue is a concern.
*   **Negative Equity:**  The most alarming trend is the negative equity in recent quarters. This indicates that the company's liabilities exceed its assets, a strong signal of financial distress.
*   **Volatile ROE:** The Return on Equity (ROE) is highly volatile and, in the most recent quarters, is either extremely high (due to the very small/negative equity base) or negative, reflecting the company's instability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

The data paints a very bleak picture for iRobot (IRBT):

*   **Severe Underperformance:**  The stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, and its cumulative return is deeply negative.
*   **Financial Distress:**  The company is facing severe financial difficulties, culminating in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. This is further supported by negative equity, declining revenue, and consistently negative EPS.
*   **High Risk:** The stock exhibits high volatility (high MDD), a negative alpha (underperformance relative to risk), and deeply negative expected returns.
*   **Negative News:** Recent news confirms the company's bankruptcy and potential sale, which are not positive for shareholders.
*   **Outdated Analyst Opinions:** Analyst opinions and target prices are likely obsolete given the recent developments.
*   **Technical Indicators:** While technical indicators like RSI might suggest the stock is oversold, these are overwhelmed by the fundamental issues. The Hybrid Signal buy signal is not reflective of the current conditions.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the bankruptcy filing, negative financial metrics, and overall negative outlook, **investing in IRBT is extremely risky**.  It is highly likely that shareholders will experience significant losses, and the potential for any meaningful recovery is very low.
