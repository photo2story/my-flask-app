**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B  | 31.03%        |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B  | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE        |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B  | 80.07%     |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B  | 296.52%    |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B  | 11005.42%  |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B   | -125.91%   |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B   | -4.24%     |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue:** Revenue has been declining recently, and appears to be struggling to find consistent sales.
    *   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have been positive but volatile.
    *   **Equity:** Negative equity in recent quarters is a major red flag, indicating the company's liabilities exceed its assets.
    *   **ROE:** Extremely high ROE values in the negative equity scenarios are mathematically skewed and not meaningful in this context. They indicate significant financial distress. The negative ROE value when Equity is positive are also concerning.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Financial Distress:** iRobot is facing significant financial challenges. Negative equity, consistent unprofitability (negative EPS), declining revenue, and high Maximum Drawdown all point to a risky investment. The high ROE figures are misleading in the context of negative equity.
*   **Underperformance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the Alpha values confirm this.
*   **Speculative Rally:** The recent stock price surge seems to be driven by external news (potential government support for robotics) rather than a fundamental turnaround in iRobot's business. This makes the rally potentially unsustainable.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The overbought RSI suggests a potential pullback, while the PPO suggests recent momentum.
*   **Analyst Opinion:** Limited analyst coverage and a single target price doesn't provide a strong basis for confidence.
*   **Risk:** The MRI and the very negative expected return clearly indicate the high risk associated with investing in iRobot. The recent news headlines showcasing iRobot at fresh lows should be taken into account.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, investing in iRobot Corp. is **highly risky**. The company's financial situation is precarious, and the recent stock price surge appears to be based on speculation rather than fundamental improvements. A potential investor would require an extremely high-risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the robotics industry and iRobot's competitive position before considering an investment.
