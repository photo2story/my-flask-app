Here's a report on iRobot (IRBT) based on the provided data, broken down into sections with analysis:

**0) Executive Summary**

iRobot (IRBT), a company known for designing and building robots, most notably the Roomba vacuum cleaner, is facing significant financial distress. The stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, with negative trends in profitability and revenue, culminating in a recent bankruptcy filing. All available indicators point towards a very risky investment, and the outlook is grim.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **iRobot Corp (IRBT) Overview:** iRobot designs and builds consumer robots, most famously the Roomba vacuum.

* MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
* Alpha is largely negative, meaning the stock has consistently underperformed its benchmark.
* Beta is low, suggesting low volatility compared to the market.
* Cap(B) steadily decreased and is nearing 0, reflecting the diminished size of the company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** \$0.4664
*   **Last Market Change:** Price: 0.4664, Previous Close: 0.6668, Change: -30.05%
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.7666
*   **20-day SMA:** 2.4237
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.0678

**Analysis:** The stock price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a strong downward trend. The large drop of -30.05% in the last market change suggests high volatility and downward pressure.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 41.60
*   **PPO:** -12.96
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -5.6 (Decreasing)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -12203.0%

**Analysis:**
*   **MRI:** A value of 0.7 suggests a medium investment recommendation, but given the bankruptcy and other negative indicators, this should be disregarded.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 41.60 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), but in a bankruptcy scenario, this doesn't necessarily signal a buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-12.96) indicates that the short-term moving average is well below the long-term moving average, confirming a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal indicates a buy position. However, it is likely not adjusted for the recent bankruptcy.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change indicates continued underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return of -12203.0% is a strong indicator of future losses if invested at this point.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has generally been decreasing over the quarters.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins fluctuate but aren't enough to offset the revenue declines.
*   **Equity:** The company's equity has turned negative, a sign of severe financial distress.
*   **ROE:** The ROE (Return on Equity) figures are highly volatile and misleading because of the negative equity. When equity is negative, ROE is no longer a meaningful metric.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

All the data points to iRobot being a very high-risk investment, bordering on uninvestable. The company has filed for bankruptcy, has negative equity, declining revenue, and a massively underperforming stock price compared to the S&P 500. Analyst opinions and price targets are outdated and should be ignored. Investing in IRBT at this point is highly speculative and carries a very high risk of total loss.
