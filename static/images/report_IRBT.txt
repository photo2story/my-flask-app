**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** The consistently negative alpha values indicate that IRBT has underperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis across all periods. In other words, even accounting for its risk, IRBT has delivered lower returns than expected.
*   **Beta:** The beta values are generally low, close to 0 or even negative in some periods. This suggests that IRBT has a weak or even inverse correlation with the overall market. A beta close to 0 indicates that the stock's price movements are largely independent of market movements.
*   **CAGR:** The compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) shows mixed performance across the years, with significant negative values in recent periods. This indicates substantial losses over the past few years.
*   **MDD:** The maximum drawdown (MDD) values are very high, consistently above 50%, indicating that the stock has experienced severe peak-to-trough declines during these periods.
*   **Market Cap:** The market capitalization values are decreasing, suggesting that the company's valuation has been shrinking over time.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 4.21

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 4.40
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 3.54

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently stable, with no change from the previous close. The 5-day and 20-day moving averages are slightly above the current price, while the 60-day moving average is significantly lower. This suggests a possible short-term downtrend that could be turning around in the longer term.

*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates a bearish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The sell signal suggests caution, despite the low MRI.

| 2025-03-31 | $-0.00B  | 11005.42%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B  | -125.91%    |

| 2024-03-31 | $0.20B  | 4.22%       |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** While revenue fluctuates, the profit margins show some positive signs. However, the inconsistency raises concerns about the company's ability to maintain profitability consistently.
*   **Equity & ROE:** The equity shows a worrying trend, dropping to negative values, which may indicate financial distress. Return on Equity (ROE) is extremely volatile, with one outlier value (11005.42%) that is likely due to the near-zero or negative equity at that time. The other ROE values are mostly negative, indicating poor returns on shareholders' equity.

### 7. Overall Summary

Based on the provided data, IRBT presents a **high-risk investment** profile.

*   **Underperformance:** Significant and persistent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Weak Financials:** Declining market capitalization, negative equity, and volatile earnings.
*   **Bearish Signals:** Negative PPO and a "Sell" hybrid signal.
*   **Poor Outlook:** The exceptionally negative expected return suggests a very pessimistic view of future performance.
*   **News & Volatility:** Recent news suggests volatility and uncertainty surrounding the company.

**Recommendation:** Given the negative trends, significant underperformance, and concerning financial indicators, a **cautious approach is strongly advised.** Thoroughly research the company's recent developments and consider the potential risks before making any investment decisions. The exceptionally negative expected return should be a major red flag.
