**0) Report Generation:** All information is in English. Simple numbers are presented first, followed by analysis.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** IRBT (iRobot Corp)
*   **Company Overview:** iRobot designs and builds consumer robots, including the Roomba vacuum.
*   **IRBT Cumulative Return:** -98.88%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:**

The current divergence is near its historical minimum, suggesting a prolonged period of underperformance.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | -93.0%  | 91.5%  | -199.0% | 0.1  | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The -93% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) indicates a severe decline in value.
*   **MDD:** The 91.5% MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows how much an investment falls from a peak to a trough, before a new peak is attained; MDD is usually quoted as a percentage.
*   **Alpha:**  A very large negative alpha (-199.0%) implies iRobot has significantly underperformed its benchmark, even after accounting for market risk.
*   **Beta:** The Beta of 0.1 suggests IRBT stock has a very low correlation to the market and experiences far less volatility than the market in general.
*   **Cap(B):** 0.0 means there is no capitalization on company

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 0.1229
*   **Last-market:** None
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.1427
*   **20-day SMA:** 1.9798
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.7079

**Analysis:** The stock price is extremely low and trending downward.  The 5-day SMA is lower than the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a recent downtrend.  The discrepancy between the short-term and longer-term moving averages suggests a significant price decline in the recent past. The 'Last-market: None' suggests potential trading halts or data unavailability.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 25.06
*   **PPO:** -17.48
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1000 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.2 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -12284.2%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the dire situation, the MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" which contradicts other indicators. This could be due to the MRI model's flawed assumptions or a focus on potential extreme value plays (highly risky).
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 25.06 indicates that the stock is heavily oversold.  This *could* suggest a potential for a bounce, but in the context of bankruptcy, it's more likely a sign of continued distress.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO (-17.48) confirms the strong downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The 'Hybrid Signal' recommendation to buy 100% of cash (1000 shares) is highly questionable given the bankruptcy news and negative fundamentals.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a potential short-term upward correction, but it's unlikely to be sustainable.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extremely negative expected return (-12284.2%) is a critical indicator of the high risk of investment, suggesting severe losses are anticipated even over the long term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Headlines all point to bankruptcy:** "iRobot Bankruptcy," "Chapter 11," "IRBT Stock Plunges," "Roomba maker files for Chapter 11."
*   **Delisting considerations:** The mention of "Nasdaq Delisting Date" further emphasizes the company's precarious position.
*   **Picea Deal implication:** The mention of "Picea Deal" hints at the cancellation of the acquisition deal.
*   **Investor sentiment:** Articles discuss why investors are chasing the shares higher (which seems irrational)

**Analysis:** The news is overwhelmingly negative. The bankruptcy filing is a critical event that significantly impacts the company's future and investor confidence. Any potential short covering rallies should be viewed with extreme caution.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Weak (no strong buy/sell recommendation)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 11.94 / 11.94 / 11.94

**Analysis:**  The analyst target price of $11.94 is *extremely* outdated and irrelevant given the bankruptcy news. The fact that there's a single opinion and the price is the same across average, high, and low indicates a lack of updated analysis and possibly abandoned coverage of the stock.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출      |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.62   | 0.15 B$  |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.68   | 0.13 B$  |
| 2025-05-06 | -2.84   | 0.10 B$  |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21   | 0.19 B$  |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21   | 0.19 B$  |

**Analysis:** iRobot has consistently reported negative earnings per share (EPS) and declining revenue. The large negative EPS in 2025-05-06 indicates a particularly weak quarter.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B     | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B     | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B     | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B     | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B     | 32.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE         |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B    | 80.07%      |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B    | 296.52%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B    | 11005.42%    |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B     | -125.91%     |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B     | -4.24%      |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profit Margin:** Revenue has been declining. While profit margins are positive, they may not be enough to offset the declining revenue and accumulated losses.
*   **Equity and ROE:** The negative equity in recent quarters is a major red flag, indicating that the company's liabilities exceed its assets, consistent with a bankrupt entity. The extremely high ROE values are meaningless and misleading in this context, as they are calculated on a negative equity base.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

iRobot is in severe financial distress, having filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500. Recent news and financial data paint a dire picture of declining revenue, negative earnings, and negative equity. Analyst opinions are outdated. While the RSI suggests an oversold condition, and there might be short-term price fluctuations, the overall outlook is extremely negative. **Investing in IRBT at this point is exceptionally risky and should be approached with extreme caution (or avoided entirely).** The MRI suggesting "High Investment Recommended" contradicts all other indicators and should not be relied upon.
