**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** iRobot Corp. is a consumer robot company known for its Roomba vacuum cleaning robots.
*   **Return Rate Comparison:** IRBT's cumulative return is -93.92% compared to VOO (S&P 500) at 99.09%.
*   **Divergence:** The divergence between IRBT and VOO is -192.9, with a relative divergence of 0.0, indicating it's at the very bottom of its divergence range relative to the S&P 500.  This means IRBT has significantly underperformed the broader market.

**Alpha, Beta, and Performance Analysis:**

The provided table shows the following trend over rolling three-year periods:

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 77.0% | 67.0% | 48.0%  | 0.1  | 2.4    |
| 2016-2018  | 69.0% | 74.9% | 54.0%  | 0.1  | 2.7    |
| 2017-2019  | -68.0%| 74.9% | -90.0% | 0.2  | 1.6    |
| 2018-2020  | -62.0%| 75.9% | -86.0% | 0.1  | 2.6    |
| 2019-2021  | -90.0%| 75.9% | -136.0%| 0.1  | 2.1    |
| 2020-2022  | -29.0%| 75.9% | -28.0% | -0.3 | 1.5    |
| 2021-2023  | -142.0%| 75.5% | -143.0%| -0.2 | 1.2    |
| 2022-2024  | -69.0%| 85.8% | -89.0% | -0.3 | 0.2    |
| 2023-2025  | -46.0%| 85.8% | -110.0%| -0.1 | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:**  Compound Annual Growth Rate declines rapidly over time, going from a strong positive to significantly negative.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown remains consistently high, showing significant risk of losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative and decreasing, meaning the stock is underperforming relative to its risk (Beta).
*   **Beta:** Beta is relatively low, which, in isolation, would suggest lower volatility compared to the market. However, the consistently negative Alpha overrides any benefit from the Beta. The beta is recently showing a negative trend which indicates the stock prices recently showing inverse relation with the market index.
*   **Cap:** Market Capitalization has shrunk drastically, indicating the company's value has plummeted.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 0.6668
*   **Last Market Data:** Price decreased by -12.49% from the previous close.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 1.5374
    *   20-day SMA: 2.4713
    *   60-day SMA: 3.1174

    The stock price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a strong downtrend. The 5-day SMA is the closest, but still higher, suggesting some recent stability (or a very slight short-term rebound) after a larger decline.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment) - While this *suggests* a medium investment level, this indicator should be interpreted cautiously given the bankruptcy news. It might not be fully capturing the current risk.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.08 - This is in the neutral range, not oversold or overbought.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -10.40 - Negative PPO suggests a bearish trend, with the short-term moving average significantly below the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash" (Very Safe) - This signal, ironically, suggests putting all available cash into the stock, labeling it "very safe." Given the other data, this is highly questionable and likely an outdated or flawed signal. It conflicts heavily with the bankruptcy news and overall performance.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -5.6 (Negative) - This indicates a recent short-term decline relative to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** -12203% - This extraordinarily negative expected return highlights the massive risk associated with the stock.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines are overwhelmingly negative and confirm the dire situation:

*   **iRobot files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.**
*   **The stock is being delisted from NASDAQ.**
*   **Analysis of how debt and competition led to bankruptcy.**
*   **Short-sellers profited from betting against iRobot.**

These headlines paint a clear picture of a company in severe financial distress.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (but with only *one* opinion, it's not very statistically significant).
*   **Target Price:** $11.94 (Again, based on limited data, this is likely outdated and irrelevant given the bankruptcy).

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue    |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.62 | 0.15 B$    |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.68 | 0.13 B$    |
| 2025-05-06 | -2.84 | 0.10 B$    |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$    |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.19 B$    |

*   EPS (Earnings Per Share) is consistently negative and, in one quarter, drastically negative.
*   Revenue has been declining.

This earnings data reinforces the company's financial struggles.

**6) Financial Information**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.15B    | 31.03%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.13B    | 30.02%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.10B    | 20.00%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.17B    | 9.54%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B    | 32.25%        |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE         |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-0.03B   | 80.07%      |
| 2025-06-30   | $-0.01B   | 296.52%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $-0.00B   | 11005.42%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.06B    | -125.91%     |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.15B    | -4.24%      |

*   **Revenue:** Shows a declining trend over the recent quarters.
*   **Profit Margin:** While positive, the declining revenue exacerbates the problem.
*   **Equity:** Equity has turned negative, indicating liabilities exceed assets - a critical warning sign.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** Extremely volatile and often meaningless when equity is near zero or negative. The huge positive ROEs when equity is negative are not a sign of good performance; instead, they indicate a severe financial problem.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

iRobot is in deep financial trouble, culminating in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The stock has significantly underperformed the market, and recent news confirms the company's distress. All indicators point to a very high-risk investment, and some "safe" signals appear to be dangerously misleading. Revenue is declining, and the company's equity has turned negative. While there may be *some* speculative potential for a turnaround *after* restructuring, this investment is currently extremely risky.

**Recommendation:**
Avoid investing in IRBT at this time. The bankruptcy filing, negative financial trends, and analyst downgrades all point to a high probability of further losses. This is a speculative play at best, and not suitable for most investors. Any "Buy" signals should be ignored given the clear evidence to the contrary.
