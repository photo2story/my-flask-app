Note the extremely high CAGR in 2018-2021, followed by significant negative returns in 2021-2024.

* **Closing Price:** $337.80
* **Previous Close:** $354.40
* **Change:** -$16.60 (-4.68%)  This represents a significant daily drop.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $352.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $371.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $392.79

The stock price is trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The large negative daily change indicates a potential period of significant price volatility.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 27.97  (Suggests oversold conditions, potential for a bounce)

The large negative price change ('Last-market' data) strongly indicates a significant short-term downward correction.  The high expected return implies long-term potential despite current volatility.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue     | Profit Margin |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity      | ROE           |

Equity is growing steadily, but ROE is highly volatile and showed a significant drop in recent quarters.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

TSLA's historical performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500. However, recent price action shows a substantial downward correction.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, potentially indicating a short-term bounce.  Long-term projected returns remain highly positive, but the high volatility and recent negative price movement warrant caution.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and the reasons for the significant drop in ROE are needed.  Investors should carefully consider risk tolerance before making investment decisions. The high beta underscores the inherent volatility of this investment.
