### 7. 종합/Overall Summary

Tesla (TSLA) has demonstrated remarkable outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by substantial alpha generation.  However, recent data suggests potential headwinds:

*   **Strengths:**  Exceptional long-term returns, positive expected future outperformance, and low market risk (MRI).
*   **Weaknesses/Risks:**  High volatility (MDD), overbought RSI, recent decline in relative divergence, lower recent EPS and revenue, and a significant drop in ROE.
*   **Considerations:** The recent news indicates potential market-moving events.  Investors should carefully monitor earnings reports and company announcements. The dramatic outperformance in the past may not be sustainable, and a price correction is possible given the overbought conditions.  While long-term prospects remain positive, short-term volatility and potential downside risks should be considered.  The conflicting information in the earnings reports requires verification.

In conclusion, TSLA presents a mixed picture. While its historical performance and long-term potential are compelling, recent trends warrant caution. A more in-depth investigation into recent earnings and news events is recommended before making any investment decisions.
