**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $332.89 (Last Market: $332.79)
* 5-Day Moving Average: $340.38
* 20-Day Moving Average: $313.45
* 60-Day Moving Average: $263.07

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting short-term bearish momentum, but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term bullish trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the last market price indicates a relatively stable day.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 60.63 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* PPO: -0.55 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change: +14.1% (Short-term upward trend)

Given the price of $332.79 is not significantly different from the closing price, there's no indication of a sharp upward or downward movement.  The expected return of 1152.5% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant projection and should be viewed with caution, reflecting historical potential but not guaranteeing future returns.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows some revenue fluctuation.  EPS has decreased in recent quarters.  Crucially, the most recent quarter's data is duplicated.  More complete data, including analyst expectations and comparisons to prior periods, is needed for a thorough assessment.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.68 | $25.18 B      |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.46 | $25.50 B      |
| 2024-04-24 | 0.37 | $21.30 B      |

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue has been relatively stable over the past year, although the March 2024 quarter showed a dip. Profit margins are generally healthy, hovering around 17-19%. ROE shows significant variation, with a particularly high value in Q4 2023 (12.66%), followed by much lower values in subsequent quarters. This requires further investigation to determine the underlying drivers.


**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*  *(Requires input of news articles from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD within the last 2 days for analysis.)*  This section should include summaries of relevant news articles, focusing on any recent earnings announcements, analyst upgrades or downgrades, and market outlook.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has demonstrated exceptionally high growth historically relative to the S&P 500, but the recent performance shows significant deceleration.  The high beta indicates considerable market volatility, and the mixed technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook, while the long-term outlook hinges heavily on the company's ability to sustain growth and navigate competitive challenges.  Thorough analysis requires filling in the gaps concerning the most recent financial performance, especially resolving the duplicated entry and incorporating the latest news and analyst opinions.  The projected long-term return is highly optimistic and shouldn't be considered a guarantee.
