**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla has demonstrated historically high returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent performance shows volatility and a significant downturn in 2021-2023, followed by a strong recovery.  While current indicators suggest a relatively healthy financial position,  further analysis is needed to fully understand the inconsistencies in EPS and ROE. The high expected return suggests potential for long-term growth, but the substantial volatility necessitates careful risk management.  Investors should consider the inherent risks associated with a high-growth, high-volatility stock like TSLA before making any investment decisions.  Additional data (e.g., debt levels, future projections) would enhance the accuracy and completeness of this analysis.
