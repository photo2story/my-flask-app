**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. The substantial difference in returns highlights TSLA's higher risk and reward profile compared to the broader market index. The relative divergence metric suggests this outperformance is not unprecedented, but is still within a high range of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable alpha and beta values across different periods.  High CAGR figures, especially in 2018-2021, point to periods of exceptional growth. However, the negative CAGR in 2021-2024 highlights significant volatility and the impact of market corrections on Tesla’s stock price. The consistently fluctuating Beta suggests significant market sensitivity but also instances of decoupling from broader market trends.  Note the extreme values for CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) reflect the high volatility of Tesla's stock price.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock performance has historically been highly volatile, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 in some periods but experiencing substantial drawdowns in others. The current price is below key moving averages, and technical indicators suggest an oversold market but bearish momentum.  While long-term expected returns are high, this is based on past performance and doesn't account for future market conditions or company-specific risks.  The recent earnings data shows consistent revenue but inconsistent EPS and a concerning decline in ROE, warranting further investigation.  Investors should proceed with caution, acknowledging the high risk associated with Tesla's stock, and conduct thorough due diligence before making investment decisions.  The extreme volatility and large swings in performance necessitate a deep understanding of the company's fundamentals, future outlook, and market dynamics before investing.
