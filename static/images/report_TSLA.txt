**6. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has historically shown exceptional returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent performance indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The stock is currently trading below its moving averages, RSI indicates oversold conditions, and PPO shows negative momentum. While the high expected return is enticing, its reliability is questionable due to TSLA's volatility and lack of supporting data for its calculation.  The incomplete financial data and inconsistencies in the earnings data further limit the scope of a comprehensive analysis.  More robust financial data, particularly total revenue and gross profit, are needed for a well-rounded assessment.  Caution is advised before making any investment decisions based on the provided limited information.
