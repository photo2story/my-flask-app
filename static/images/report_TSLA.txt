**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between TSLA and VOO as of the last data point is 1062.0 (1182.68 - 120.73). The relative divergence of 64.6% indicates that TSLA's performance has been substantially above the S&P 500 historically, placing it in the upper range of historical performance relative to the index. However, this relative strength appears to have decreased recently as shown in the sharp negative CAGR in recent years.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values for TSLA between 2018 and 2021, indicating exceptional growth during those periods, with correspondingly high alpha values reflecting outperformance relative to the market. However, the subsequent years show extremely negative CAGRs, suggesting a significant downturn in performance. The beta consistently remains around 0.1, indicating low correlation with the overall market.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) steadily increased until the recent downturn.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|

| 2016-2018  | 46.0%    | 21.0%    | 0.1   | 0.1   | 71.0   |
| 2017-2019  | 48.0%    | 21.0%    | 0.1   | 0.1   | 90.0   |
| 2018-2020  | 1069.0%  | 21.1%    | 0.1   | 0.1   | 755.0  |
| 2019-2021  | 1463.0% | 21.1%    | 0.1   | 0.1   | 1131.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 238.0%   | 36.6%    | 0.1   | 0.1   | 395.0  |
| 2021-2023  | -456.0%  | 36.6%    | 0.1   | 0.1   | 798.0  |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $389.79
* 5-Day Moving Average: $371.57
* 20-Day Moving Average: $346.47
* 60-Day Moving Average: $279.55

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the relatively small difference between the 5 and 20-day averages suggests this upward momentum might be weakening.  The substantial gap between the 60-day average and the current price reflects a more significant recent price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* RSI: 72.30 –  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70).  This suggests potential for a short-term correction.
* PPO: 0.24 – Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* Relative Strength Change (20-day): +6.2 –  Positive change, confirming short-term upward movement.
* Expected Return (2+ years): 935.8% – This represents a significantly higher expected return than the S&P 500.  However, this should be viewed with caution considering the volatility shown in the CAGR data. The extremely high expected return is predicated on a very optimistic future forecast.  A more conservative estimate, factoring in the recent significant decline, would be more appropriate.
