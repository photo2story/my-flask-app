## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Performance Review

**0. Overview:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison:**

Tesla's cumulative return of 2327.79% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 61.32% over the analyzed period.  The difference is 2266.47%.  The relative divergence of 74.8% indicates Tesla's performance is exceptionally high compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows high volatility and significant outperformance (high alpha values) in recent years (2018-2025), especially contrasted to the lower growth and negative alpha in the earlier years (2015-2017). This suggests a period of rapid growth and market-beating returns, but also higher risk. The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects this growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $251.005
* **Last Market Price:** $250.115
* **Previous Close:** $272.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $242.573
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $253.6662
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $316.1961

The last market price shows a significant drop of $8.11 (-8.11%) compared to the previous close, indicating a recent downturn. The price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, reinforcing this bearish trend.  The 5-day moving average is significantly lower, suggesting a sharp recent decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4271 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.75 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.0884 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.4% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 618.1% (This is a very high expected return;  consider the associated high risk.)
* **Price Change Impact:** The significant price drop of $8.11 reflects a noticeable short-term negative impact.  This suggests a potential short-term market correction or increased risk aversion.

The high expected return should be viewed cautiously given the recent price drop and the inherent volatility of Tesla's stock.

Equity shows steady growth, but ROE is inconsistent, with a significant drop in recent quarters, compared to the previous year.  This needs further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla (TSLA) has shown exceptional long-term growth significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent price action indicates a potential short-term downturn. While the expected return is high, this needs to be carefully considered in light of the recent price drop and the historical volatility of the stock.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the earnings data and the significant drop in ROE is needed.  A long-term investment strategy, acknowledging the high risk involved, might still be considered, but careful monitoring is essential.  The current bearish market signals should be noted before making any investment decisions.
