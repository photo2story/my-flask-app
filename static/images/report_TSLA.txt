Okay, here's a comprehensive report on Tesla (TSLA), incorporating all the provided data points and requests:

**Tesla Inc (TSLA) Analysis**

Tesla Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, energy generation and storage systems, and related services.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Key Numbers:**
    *   TSLA Cumulative Return: 2535.97%
    *   VOO Cumulative Return: 86.23%
    *   Absolute Spread: 2749.6
    *   Relative Spread: 83.3 (on a scale where 0 is the minimum spread and 100 is the maximum historical spread)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Tesla has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the long term.
    *   The "Relative Spread" of 83.3 suggests that the current outperformance is near the higher end of its historical range relative to VOO. This doesn't mean it's *guaranteed* to revert, but it does indicate the outperformance may be extended compared to its historical trends.  It's important to remember this is relative to the *range* of historical differences, not a percentile rank in the statistical sense.
    *   The large spread highlights both the potential rewards and the risks associated with investing in a high-growth stock like Tesla compared to a broader market index.

    *   **Beta:**  Generally low (around 0.1 -0.7), except for a few years with negative beta values, meaning Tesla is less sensitive to overall market movements, recently showing higher sensitivity to the market with increasing beta value.

    *   The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, further supporting the recent upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Key Numbers:**
    *   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.3234 (Low Risk)
    *   RSI: 70.29
    *   PPO: 0.9917
    *   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (3 shares - Safe - MRI:0.32)
    *   Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change: +3.0
    *   Expected Return: 528.6%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.3234 indicates a low-risk market environment, suggesting favorable conditions for investment.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 70.29 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), suggesting the stock *may* be due for a pullback or consolidation. However, RSI can remain elevated in strong uptrends.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO of 0.9917 suggests the price is slightly above its moving averages, supporting the short-term upward trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy signal, allocating most of the cash into Tesla (90%). Given the low MRI, this signal suggests the model is more confident in buying Tesla at the current level.
    *   **Recent Relative Spread Change:** The +3.0 change in the relative spread indicates short-term outperformance compared to VOO.
    *   **Expected Return:**  The exceptionally high expected return (528.6%) suggests very optimistic projections for Tesla's future performance relative to the S&P 500 over a longer-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  *This should be viewed with caution as such high returns are rarely sustained over long periods.*
    *   **Price Change:** The minor price decrease {'price': 339.38, 'previousClose': 340.84, 'change': -0.43} does not indicate a major volatility event. If the change was significant, the Hybrid signal should be reviewed and may suggest allocating some cash.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       |   EPS |   매출   |
|:-----------|------:|---------:|
| 2025-07-24 |  0.36 | 22.50 B$ |
| 2025-04-23 |  0.13 | 19.34 B$ |
| 2024-10-24 |  0.68 | 25.18 B$ |
| 2025-01-30 |  0.68 | 25.18 B$ |
| 2024-07-24 |  0.46 | 25.50 B$ |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** EPS has fluctuated, with more recent quarters showing lower EPS compared to earlier ones. This may be a cause for concern, but needs to be investigated further (e.g., are these lower EPS due to temporary factors like investments or supply chain issues?).
    *   **Revenue:** Revenue has also fluctuated, with recent quarters showing lower revenue compared to late 2024.  Like EPS, this requires deeper investigation to understand the underlying causes.

**6. Financial Information**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   |   Profit Margin |
|:-----------|:----------|----------------:|
| 2025-06-30 | $22.50B   |         17.24 % |
| 2025-03-31 | $19.34B   |         16.31 % |
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B   |         16.26 % |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B   |         19.84 % |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B   |         17.95 % |

*   **Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    |    ROE |
|:-----------|:----------|-------:|
| 2025-06-30 | $77.31B   |  1.52 % |
| 2025-03-31 | $74.65B   |  0.55 % |
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B   |  3.23 % |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B   |  3.10 % |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B   |  2.11 % |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue and Profit Margin:**  Confirm the observations from the earnings data. Revenue has decreased in recent quarters, and profit margins, while still healthy, have also experienced some fluctuation.
    *   **Equity and ROE (Return on Equity):** Equity is steadily increasing, which is a positive sign. However, ROE has decreased significantly in recent quarters. This indicates that Tesla is generating less profit for each dollar of equity invested in the company. This warrants further investigation.

**7. Overall Analysis**

*   **Summary:**
    *   **Strong Historical Performance:** Tesla has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.
    *   **Recent Upward Momentum:**  Technical indicators suggest continued upward momentum in the short term.
    *   **High Volatility:**  The stock experiences significant price swings, as evidenced by the MDD figures and news reports.
    *   **Decreasing Profitability:** Recent earnings and financial data point to potentially weakening profitability.
    *   **Optimistic Outlook:** The hybrid signal is a very strong indicator, the expected return suggests highly optimistic future performance.

*   **Conclusion:**

Tesla remains a high-growth stock with significant potential, but also significant risk. The recent decline in profitability metrics is a cause for concern and warrants further investigation. The strong technical indicators and optimistic expected return suggest that the market is still very bullish on Tesla. However, investors should be aware of the inherent volatility and closely monitor the company's financial performance and news flow. The recommendation of the Hybrid Signal is currently a very strong buy.
