## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows Tesla's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between TSLA and VOO is approximately 1105.7 percentage points  as of the last data point.  The relative divergence indicates TSLA's performance is in the 67.1st percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This highlights significant outperformance but also emphasizes the volatility of TSLA relative to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures for TSLA show incredibly high growth in certain periods (1069% and 1463%),  but also significant negative growth in others (-456% and -59%).  The high beta values (mostly above 70) demonstrate TSLA's high sensitivity to overall market movements.  However, the consistently low alpha values suggest that TSLA's outperformance isn't solely attributable to skill or factors beyond market movements.  This volatility needs careful consideration.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock performance has historically shown periods of extraordinary growth, but also significant volatility and drawdowns.  While the cumulative return substantially outperforms the S&P 500,  the high beta and inconsistent financial metrics highlight substantial risk.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be viewed with considerable skepticism.  A deeper dive into the company's financials, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Given the volatility and substantial risk, a conservative approach to investment in TSLA is strongly advised.
