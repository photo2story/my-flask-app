| 2023-2025  | 592.0%  | 79.3% | 524.0%  | 0.8   | 1531.4  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR varies significantly, with the highest values in the 2018-2021 periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Relatively high MDD values across all periods indicate substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently high Alpha values suggest Tesla's returns are often independent of market movements, particularly strong in recent periods.
*   **Beta:** Low Beta values suggest Tesla's price is not highly correlated with the S&P 500.

#### c) Recent Price Movement:

*   **Current Price:** $460.565
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $460.45, Previous Close: $460.55, Change: -0.02
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 446.931
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 439.1142
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 390.9468

The current price is slightly down from the previous close.  The moving averages indicate an upward trend, with the 5-day moving average above the 20-day, and both above the 60-day. The recent marginal decrease `{'price': 460.45, 'previousClose': 460.55, 'change': -0.02}` doesn't indicate a significant short-term volatility issue.

#### d) Index Indicators:

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.73 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.176 (Slightly bearish, but close to zero)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_80%_Sell (suggests a strategy to reduce holdings due to risk, but the high MRI suggests the opposite)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** -0.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 433.4% (Significant long-term outperformance expected vs. S&P 500)

The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, conflicting with the Hybrid Signal's recommendation to reduce holdings. The RSI and PPO are relatively neutral. The recent decline in relative deviation suggests a short-term downturn compared to its historical outperformance against the S&P 500.

#### e) Recent News & Significant Events:

*   **BofA:** Sees Tesla as a leader in Physical AI but notes the current valuation is stretched.
*   **Nvidia:** AI chip giant Nvidia becomes world's first $5 trillion company.
*   **Freedom Capital:** Upgrades Tesla to Hold, raises Price Target to $406, citing stabilized EV deliveries.

These headlines present a mixed view.  Tesla is recognized for its potential in AI, but valuation concerns exist.  The upgrade to "Hold" and a higher price target are moderately positive. The AI sector's overall strength (Nvidia's milestone) is relevant for investor sentiment towards tech-related companies like Tesla.

#### f) Analyst Opinions:

*   **Consensus:** Hold (2.57)
*   **Opinions:** 40
*   **Target Price:** Average: $395.53, High: $600.00, Low: $120.00

### 3. Conclusion:

Tesla has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with substantial alpha generation. However, this comes with high volatility (as indicated by MDD). Recent price movement suggests a potential short-term correction, but overall, the trend remains upward based on moving averages.

The Market Risk Indicator is high, but analyst opinions are mixed, and the Hybrid Signal is bearish. News highlights both Tesla's leadership in AI and concerns about valuation.

**Overall Recommendation:** Given the high expected return and MRI, a long-term investment might be considered. However, due to the high volatility, mixed analyst sentiment, and potentially stretched valuation, investors should proceed cautiously, considering potential short-term fluctuations and the recommendation to reduce holdings (Hybrid Signal). A balanced approach might involve gradually accumulating shares, especially during periods of price weakness. The provided "hold" analyst consensus reinforces the need for caution and further research.
