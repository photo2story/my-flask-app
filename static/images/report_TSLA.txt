## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return for TSLA is 1089.58%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%. The difference in cumulative returns is 960.7%.  This places TSLA at the 55.8th percentile of its historical relative divergence to the S&P 500, based on a range of -54.5% to 1763.9%. While this shows strong outperformance historically, it doesn't predict future performance. The high alpha values (consistently above 2.8) in the provided data suggest significant outperformance relative to the market benchmark (S&P 500), while the beta values (mostly around 3) indicate higher volatility than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $332.89 (Last Market: $332.79)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $340.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $313.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $263.07

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bearish trend, but above its 20 and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term bullish trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the last market price suggests a stable market close.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.63 (Neither overbought nor oversold; suggests a relatively neutral momentum.)
* **PPO:** -0.55 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +14.1% (Short-term upward trend in relative performance against the S&P 500).
* **Expected Return:** 1152.5% (This is a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return compared to the S&P 500, assuming continued outperformance at a similar historical rate.  This is a high projection and should be treated cautiously).
* **332.79 Price Consideration:**  The closing price ($332.89) is very close to the last market price ($332.79), indicating no significant intraday price swings or volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility.  Revenue was relatively consistent between $23B and $25B, with a slight dip in Q1 2024.  EPS also fluctuated, with the highest EPS in Q4 2024 ($0.68) and the lowest in Q1 2024 ($0.37). There's no information available to compare these results to expectations, so it is impossible to assess whether these figures represent beats or misses.  A clear trend in either revenue or EPS is difficult to establish from this limited data.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some variability but generally remains high.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margin fluctuated, ranging from 17.35% to 19.84%.
* **Equity:**  Equity shows growth, but with considerable fluctuation.
* **ROE:**  ROE experienced significant variation, from 1.75% to 12.66%, reflecting the volatility of profitability.

The financial information points to strong revenue but inconsistent profitability and ROE. More data would be needed to establish clearer trends and make informed judgments.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook is provided, so a detailed analysis is not possible. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are similarly absent. Information regarding recent earnings announcements within the past two days is also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla has demonstrated significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, indicated by a high cumulative return and consistently high alpha.  However, the company also exhibits high volatility, as seen in its beta and recent price fluctuations. While the recent earnings data suggests strong revenue, profitability and ROE are inconsistent. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with the RSI indicating neutral momentum, and the PPO suggesting bearish momentum, while relative divergence shows short-term upward momentum. The projected long-term return is exceptionally high and should be treated with considerable caution.  More comprehensive data, including analyst opinions and market outlook, is needed for a complete and accurate assessment.  The provided data highlights the company's strong historical growth but also raises concerns regarding its volatility and inconsistent profitability.
