**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 39.0% | 72.0% | 10.0% | -0.0 | 69.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 25.0% | 76.2% | 10.0% | -0.0 | 73.8 |
| 2017-2019  | 20.0% | 76.2% | -3.0% | 0.3 | 92.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 634.0% | 82.6% | 610.0% | 0.2 | 782.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 837.0% | 82.6% | 790.0% | 0.1 | 1171.5 |
| 2020-2022  | 302.0% | 86.0% | 303.0% | 0.3 | 409.7 |

| 2022-2024  | 685.0% | 86.0% | 665.0% | 0.5 | 1343.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 617.0% | 79.4% | 551.0% | 0.8 | 1600.4 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows periods of extremely high growth (e.g., 2018-2020, 2019-2021) and then more moderated growth after that, but still very strong.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high drawdowns, indicating significant volatility.  Tesla can experience substantial price declines.
*   **Alpha:**  Generally very positive, indicating outperformance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500). High Alpha values (especially in 2018-2020, 2019-2021, and 2022-2024) mean the stock performed much better than expected given the market's performance.
*   **Beta:**  Generally low, hovering around 0. This suggests that the price of Tesla is not correlated with the index.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization increasing over time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 481.20
*   **Last-market:** price = 481.2, previousClose = 483.37, change = -0.45
*   **5-day SMA:** 483.397
*   **20-day SMA:** 447.9808
*   **60-day SMA:** 440.4282

**Analysis:**

*   The closing price is slightly below the 5-day SMA, which suggests that the stock price is in a slight downtrend.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA. This overall indicates an upward trend over the past few months. The recent dip below the 5-day SMA might be a short-term correction within that larger uptrend.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 73.13 (Overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 1.0305
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)

*   **Price Change:** {'price': 481.2, 'previousClose': 483.37, 'change': -0.45} (Slight decrease)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  Suggests a medium level of risk and a corresponding investment recommendation.
*   **RSI:**  Above 70, indicates that the stock is currently overbought and may be due for a correction or pullback.
*   **PPO:** Positive, indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, confirming the current upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Signals a "Buy" with 100% of available cash.
*   **Divergence Change:** Confirms a short-term upward trend.
*   **Price Change:** The small negative price change is minor.
*   **Expected Return:** An extremely high expected return (403.1%) suggests very optimistic long-term projections, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  This should be viewed cautiously, as such high returns are unlikely to be sustained indefinitely.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. There are positive headlines related to record highs and robotaxi hype. However, there are also concerns about "Mad Max" mode, inflated valuation, and potentially slow EV sales. This highlights the debate surrounding Tesla: optimism about future potential versus concerns about current valuation and specific business decisions.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean:** 2.63 (~Hold)
*   **Opinions:** 40
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 395.73 / High: 600.00 / Low: 120.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** None Listed

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting a neutral outlook on the stock. The wide range in target prices (120.00 to 600.00) indicates significant disagreement among analysts regarding Tesla's valuation. The average target price of 395.73 is below the current price of 481.2, implying that analysts, on average, believe the stock is overvalued. The lack of recent rating changes suggests no major shifts in analyst sentiment.

*   **High Volatility:**  The MDD highlights significant price swings.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** The wide range of analyst target prices indicates a lack of consensus on valuation. While some analysts focus on future growth, others point to inflated metrics.
*   **Overbought Condition:** The RSI suggests the stock may be overbought in the short term.
*   **Future Growth Expectations:** The very high expected return highlights the market's optimism about Tesla's long-term potential, particularly in areas like robotaxis and energy solutions. However, relying solely on hype to predict long-term growth comes with risk.
*   **Mixed News Sentiment:** Recent news reflects both excitement about future technologies and concerns about valuation and specific business decisions.
*   **Mixed Financial Metrics:** Revenue and profit margins are growing, but the rate of increase may be slowing down. Return on equity (ROE) is relatively low.

Based on this data, a cautious approach is warranted. While the stock has demonstrated incredible historical performance and future growth potential, the overbought condition, analyst concerns about valuation, and mixed news sentiment suggest that the stock may be due for a correction.

The MRI indicates a medium investment risk and the consensus from the hybrid signal is to still buy the stock. This decision to invest depends on your personal risk tolerance and investment goals.
