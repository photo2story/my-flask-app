**1) Return Rate Comparison: TSLA vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Tesla Inc. is an electric vehicle and clean energy company.
*   **Cumulative Return (TSLA):** 1236.44%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 103.21%
*   **Divergence:** 1152.5 (Relative Divergence: 69.4)

**Analysis:**

Tesla has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period reflected in the cumulative returns. The divergence of 1152.5 indicates a substantial difference in performance.  The relative divergence of 69.4 suggests that the current divergence is in the middle to upper range of its historical fluctuations.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|---------|------|--------|

| 2016-2018  | 25.0%  | 76.2% | 10.0%   | -0.0 | 73.8   |
| 2017-2019  | 20.0%  | 76.2% | -3.0%   | 0.3  | 92.8   |
| 2018-2020  | 634.0% | 82.6% | 610.0%  | 0.2  | 782.3  |
| 2019-2021  | 837.0% | 82.6% | 790.0%  | 0.1  | 1171.5 |
| 2020-2022  | 302.0% | 86.0% | 303.0%  | 0.3  | 409.7  |
| 2021-2023  | 269.0% | 86.0% | 267.0%  | 0.4  | 826.4  |
| 2022-2024  | 685.0% | 86.0% | 665.0%  | 0.5  | 1343.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 600.0% | 79.4% | 532.0%  | 0.8  | 1580.4 |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR shows the average annual growth rate over the specified period, assuming profits are reinvested during the term. Tesla's CAGR has been highly variable, with significant spikes in certain periods (e.g., 2018-2021).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** MDD represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. Tesla has experienced substantial MDDs, indicating considerable volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the excess return relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). Tesla's Alpha is generally very high, particularly during periods of strong growth, suggesting it has outperformed the market. However, it can sometimes be negative, indicating underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta close to 0 (or negative in some cases) suggests a relatively low correlation with the market. Tesla's Beta is relatively low and it indicates that the stock is less sensitive to market movements than other stocks.
*   **Cap(B):**  This appears to represent market capitalization in billions.  It shows the dramatic growth in Tesla's market cap over time.

**Analysis:**

Tesla's high Alpha values indicate significant outperformance, driven by company-specific factors rather than just market movements.  The high MDDs are a reminder of the stock's volatility. The generally low Beta numbers suggests that Tesla's performance is not always correlated with market trends.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 475.19
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 475.19, 'previousClose': 485.4, 'change': -2.1}
*   **5-day SMA:** 483.216
*   **20-day SMA:** 461.9823
*   **60-day SMA:** 442.9603

**Analysis:**

The current price (475.19) is below the 5-day SMA (483.216), suggesting a short-term downward trend.  However, the 20-day SMA (461.9823) and 60-day SMA (442.9603) are below the current price, indicating a general upward trend over the medium and longer term. The last market shows a slight decrease in price.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 59.65
*   **PPO:** 0.28
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** 3.6 (+) (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 417.8%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI of 1.0 indicates the model recommends a high investment level in the stock.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 59.65 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), but is not there yet. It suggests increasing buying pressure, but not at an extreme level.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.28 indicates that the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, which is a bullish signal, but not overwhelmingly so.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100%" signal reinforces the positive outlook, suggesting a high confidence level in further price appreciation.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence further supports the short-term bullish view.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return of 417.8% reflects the model's optimism about Tesla's long-term growth potential compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

The recent news headlines present a mixed picture:

*   **Robotaxi Focus:** Mentions of robotaxi deadlines and a "robotaxi tug-of-war" indicate ongoing development and potential future revenue streams, but also potential risks and competition.
*   **Delivery Forecast Cuts:** This is a negative signal, suggesting potential near-term headwinds.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Dan Ives' prediction of a $3 trillion valuation in 2026 is a very bullish signal, indicating strong long-term confidence.
*   **Model S Lease Terms:** This news is less significant but indicates ongoing efforts to attract customers.
*   **Margin Compression:** This is a potential concern, suggesting that Tesla might be facing challenges in maintaining profitability.
*   **NHTSA Probe:** Potential regulatory issues can create uncertainty.

**Analysis:**

The news headlines highlight both opportunities (robotaxis, analyst optimism) and challenges (delivery forecast cuts, margin compression, regulatory probes).  The key will be how Tesla navigates these challenges and capitalizes on the opportunities. The emphasis on robotaxis suggests a shift towards autonomous driving and related services, which could be a major growth driver.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.63 (~Hold)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 399.15 / 600.00 / 120.00

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is currently "Hold," suggesting a neutral outlook on the stock. The average target price of $399.15 is *below* the current price of $475.19, indicating that analysts, on average, believe the stock is overvalued. However, the wide range between the high ($600) and low ($120) target prices reflects significant disagreement among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-10-23 | 0.43 | 28.09 B$   |
| 2025-07-24 | 0.36 | 22.50 B$   |
| 2025-04-23 | 0.13 | 19.34 B$   |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.68 | 25.18 B$   |
| 2025-01-30 | 0.68 | 25.18 B$   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue shows a general upward trend over the last four quarters, with some fluctuations. The latest quarter (2025-10-23) shows the highest revenue.
*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS has been volatile. The most recent EPS is lower than the peak EPS reported earlier.

This suggests that while Tesla's revenue is growing, its profitability (as measured by EPS) is more inconsistent.

**Overall Recommendation (Based Solely on Provided Data):**

Based on this data, a *cautious* approach is warranted. The high expected return and MRI suggest potential upside, but the analyst consensus, volatile earnings, and potential headwinds (delivery forecasts, margin compression) indicate risks. This points to potentially high rewards, but it also suggests an elevated level of risk to investors who choose to invest.

It's recommended to do further research, considering factors beyond the provided data, before making any investment decisions.
