## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1228.90%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 115.09%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1113.8%, placing it at the 67.6th percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  The provided data shows a substantial outperformance relative to the benchmark index across several periods, although the 2021-2023 period shows a significant negative return for TSLA.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The analysis shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)  with significant volatility, as reflected in high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values in some periods.  The alpha is consistently low (around 0.1), suggesting that the outperformance may be primarily attributable to market movements (beta), rather than skillful management.  The beta increases dramatically during periods of high growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $403.84
* **Last Market Price:** $380.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $433.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $418.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $326.56

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a more substantial decline over the longer term. The Last Market Price of $380.89 is lower than the Closing Price, indicating a recent price drop.  This price drop could be considered a relatively sharp downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.57 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -2.03 (Negative; suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 408.8% (This represents projected outperformance of S&P 500 over the long term; requires validation and should be treated as an estimate).

The relatively neutral RSI and negative PPO indicate mixed signals. The negative relative divergence reinforces the short-term bearish trend. The large expected return highlights potential long-term growth, though the uncertainty associated with such long-term projections is significant.
