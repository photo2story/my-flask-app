## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1227.83%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1105.67%. This places TSLA's performance at the 90th percentile (67.1% relative divergence) compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided historical range of divergence.  While this shows significant outperformance historically, it's crucial to remember past performance is not indicative of future results.

The Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, indicating a slight outperformance relative to the market (S&P 500). The Beta, however, shows significant volatility, fluctuating greatly over the years, reflecting TSLA's high sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial increase in Beta from 2018 onward highlights this increased volatility during periods of high growth.  Note that the provided CAGR data shows drastically different performance metrics year-over-year, indicating a volatile stock subject to significant swings in market sentiment and growth. The large negative CAGR for 2021-2023 is particularly concerning.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $406.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $416.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $414.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $370.67

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The price has recently decreased by $1.41 (-1.406473%) compared to the previous closing price.  This indicates a short-term bearish momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.50 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in a neutral territory.
* **PPO:** -0.62 – A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum, aligning with the moving averages.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.7 – Shows a recent decrease in the stock's relative strength compared to the benchmark.

The significant price drop (-1.41) suggests that recent market events are impacting the price negatively. This does not necessarily indicate a complete market correction, but it warrants close monitoring of the stock's ongoing performance.  The provided expected return of 409.4% is likely an extremely optimistic projection given the volatility evidenced in the CAGR numbers.  It needs significant clarification regarding its methodology and underlying assumptions, especially given the recent negative performance.  A more realistic assessment of long-term returns compared to the S&P 500 should be conducted using a more robust methodology than a single-point estimate.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries for October 24th, 2024.  Assuming the duplicate entry is an error, and focusing on the remaining data:  While revenue has generally shown positive growth, EPS isn't always increasing concurrently.  There is a fluctuation in both revenue and EPS, which needs further investigation before a definitive analysis can be made. A trend analysis requires a complete dataset without discrepancies.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some fluctuations quarter-over-quarter.  Profit margins are relatively stable, although there's some decrease in the second quarter of 2024.  Equity shows growth, but the Return on Equity (ROE) is highly volatile, reaching a low of 1.75% and a high of 12.66% within a short period, indicating potential instability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows a history of significant outperformance against the S&P 500, yet its current performance signals a potential downward trend. The recent price drop, bearish PPO, and negative relative divergence suggest short-term weakness.  However, the company's long-term potential should not be dismissed entirely given the past performance indicated by CAGR.  Long-term investors should proceed with caution, monitoring market conditions and carefully assessing the reliability of the presented expected return, as the historical data exhibits significant volatility. Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the provided earnings data and a more rigorous analysis of future growth projections are needed before making informed investment decisions.  The volatile ROE warrants a detailed examination of the company's capital allocation and profitability strategies.
