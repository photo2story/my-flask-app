**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  Its stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, showing substantial growth over various periods.  Recent data indicates a relatively high RSI, suggesting potential overbought conditions.  Earnings show growth, but more comprehensive financial data is needed for a complete picture.


**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 2656.73%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 88.48%
* **Return Difference:** 2568.25%
* **Relative Divergence:** 84.9% (This indicates TSLA's performance is at the 84.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO's performance over the analyzed period.  It does *not* mean TSLA outperformed VOO by 84.9%).

The provided alpha and beta data across different years shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), indicating significant returns. However, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) suggests periods of substantial risk and volatility.  The increasing beta across years signifies increasing market sensitivity.  Note the extraordinary returns from 2018 onwards.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue         |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2025-04-23 | $0.13  | $19.34 Billion  |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68  | $25.18 Billion  |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68  | $25.18 Billion  |

| 2025-01-30 | $0.46  | $25.50 Billion  |

Revenue shows a general upward trend. However, the data shows inconsistencies (duplicate entries for Jan 30th, for example).  More reliable and complete data is needed for a robust analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is a significant limitation to the overall assessment.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock has demonstrated exceptional growth significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the high volatility (MDD) and the lack of complete financial data introduce significant uncertainty.  While the long-term outlook appears positive based on the provided expected return, the high RSI and recent negative divergence suggest potential short-term corrections.  A more comprehensive financial analysis, including crucial metrics like total revenue and gross profit, and a more detailed look at the earnings data is vital to making an informed investment decision.  The available data presents a fragmented picture and more information is needed before drawing firm conclusions.
