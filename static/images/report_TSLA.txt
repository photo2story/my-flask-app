## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**0. Overview:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return (1047.84%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (122.48%) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is 925.4%, placing it at the 56.7th percentile of the historical range of divergence (max: 1673.1, min: -53.2). This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500, although the relative percentile shows periods of much greater and lesser divergence existed previously.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows volatile performance and significant swings in outperformance against the market. While the CAGR is often very high, it's crucial to note the extremely high maximum drawdowns (MDD), indicating significant risk.  The high Alpha values in certain periods strongly suggest outperformance, while the Beta fluctuates, implying variable sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth. The negative CAGR and Alpha in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 highlight periods of significant underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $354.11
* **5-day Moving Average:** $346.18
* **20-day Moving Average:** $380.95
* **60-day Moving Average:** $392.37

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.03 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory)

* **Expected Return:** 558.9% (Long-term (2+ years) expected excess return over S&P 500)

The low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum, while the positive relative divergence suggests a recent short-term upward trend.  The high expected return reflects the significant historical outperformance, but this should be interpreted cautiously given the volatile nature of Tesla's past performance.

**6. Summary:**

Tesla's historical performance shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but with high volatility and substantial risk as indicated by the large maximum drawdowns.  Current technical indicators suggest bearish momentum in the short term. The long-term expected return is high, but relies on a continuation of past outperformance which is not guaranteed.  Further investigation is needed to resolve the inconsistencies in the earnings data and to understand the recent decrease in ROE.  Investors should carefully consider this volatility and risk before making any investment decisions.  The data provided needs further cleaning and completeness to provide a more accurate and in-depth analysis.
