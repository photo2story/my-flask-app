## 9️⃣ Summary & Investment Outlook  

- **Performance**: TSLA delivers a dramatic cumulative return vs. the S&P 500, with a solid relative divergence of 66.5 %.  
- **Risk**: Beta > 1, MRI 0.7, and negative PPO suggest elevated risk.  
- **Catalysts**: Positive news, potential upside in EV demand, and improving earnings.  
- **Headwinds**: Production concerns (Berlin Gigafactory), sell‑side coverage, and valuation pressure.  
- **Recommendation**: For risk‑tolerant investors seeking high upside, a **small allocation** could be justified, ideally with a **buy‑the‑dip** strategy around the 20‑day SMA. Long‑term holders may benefit from the 398.6 % expected excess return, but should monitor risk metrics closely.
