2024-12-20 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1348.30%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 114.36%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1233.94%, placing it at the 74.5th percentile of its historical relative divergence compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates that TSLA's performance has been considerably higher than the benchmark index over the analyzed period. The provided alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting a modest outperformance relative to the market, though the beta fluctuates wildly reflecting high market sensitivity, particularly in recent years.  The massive CAGR figures reflect this volatile performance and should be considered alongside the substantial MDD (Maximum Drawdown).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $440.13
* **Last Market Price:** $434.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $447.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $383.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $302.80

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor pullback.  However, it's significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating an upward trend over the medium and long term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.37 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.08 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.3% (Short-term upward trend)

The RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, implying potential for a short-term correction. However, the positive PPO and the upward trend in relative divergence suggest ongoing bullish momentum. The significant difference between the last market price ($434.09) and the closing price ($440.13) doesn't suggest a dramatic price jump or drop.  The expected return of 828% over the long term (2+ years) versus the S&P 500 is a significant projection and needs to be considered within the context of the high volatility shown in the historical data.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), the current market outlook, and analyst opinions which are not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, reflecting strong growth. However, this growth comes with considerable volatility, as evidenced by the high beta and significant maximum drawdowns. Recent price movements indicate an upward trend, but technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term correction. While recent earnings show mixed results, EPS has increased over the last two quarters.  Financial information reveals strong revenue and equity growth, yet the ROE is volatile.  Missing information on recent news and analyst opinions prevents a complete assessment. The projected long-term return, while impressive, must be considered in the light of the inherent risk associated with TSLA's high volatility.  Further investigation into the causes of the ROE fluctuation and comparison of reported earnings to expectations are crucial before forming a definitive investment opinion.
