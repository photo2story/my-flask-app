Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1246.77%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.83%.  The difference in cumulative returns between TSLA and VOO is 1123.94%.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and significant swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), ranging from -449% to 1462%. The Alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market, however, this is heavily influenced by the extremely volatile CAGR.  The Beta consistently remains close to 0.1 suggesting low correlation with the market benchmark. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) remains constant at $1324B across all periods.  This should be interpreted cautiously as it is a single figure across several years and may not reflect reality accurately.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $412.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $418.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $415.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $368.40

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price change (-$0.66) represents a minor decrease, but the movement relative to the moving averages suggests a stronger downturn.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.63 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.51 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.3% (Short-term downtrend)

The recent price drop is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant event, such as a flash crash. The expected return of 396.6% represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, such projections should be viewed as highly speculative given the historical volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68  | $25.18B      |

| 2024-10-24 | $0.58  | $23.35B      | *(Note: Duplicate entry)*

There seems to be a duplicate entry for October 24th, 2024.  Assuming the second entry is an error, revenue shows some fluctuation but overall remains relatively stable. EPS also shows some fluctuation, suggesting some variability in profitability. More comprehensive data and analysis are needed to draw robust conclusions.  The discrepancy requires clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation, but generally remains relatively high.  Profit margins are generally healthy, though they show some volatility.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity      | ROE           |

Equity is generally increasing, although the ROE shows significant volatility, with a particularly high value in Q4 2023 that needs further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, but this performance has been highly volatile.  Recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, though technical indicators are not definitively bearish.  Earnings and financial data show a generally healthy company with some fluctuations in profitability. The extremely high projected long-term return should be treated with extreme caution due to historical volatility. Further investigation into the outlier ROE value and duplicate earnings data is crucial.  A thorough due diligence process is essential before making any investment decisions.  The significant volatility should be considered alongside the potential high returns when evaluating investment options.
