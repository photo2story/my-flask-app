*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 311.83
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 274.03

**Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day moving average but remains above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages.  The slight price decrease and price is below the 5-day moving average suggests a short-term downward trend or consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.366 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 75.42 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.54
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (3 shares - Caution - MRI:0.38) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-05-01)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -3.0 (Short-term Decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** 350% (Long-Term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The RSI indicates that TSLA is currently overbought, which often precedes a price correction. The negative change in relative divergence suggests a recent weakening in TSLA's performance compared to its benchmark.  The MRI indicates the low risk, but the hybrid signal gives caution because of MRI. Despite these short-term warning signs, the very high expected return (350% over the long term compared to the S&P 500) suggests strong confidence in Tesla's future growth potential.  The recent price change of -0.5% is not significant enough on its own to indicate a major event, but it reinforces the potential for a short-term pullback.

|------------|------------|---------|
| 2025-03-31 | $74.65B    | 0.55%   |

**Analysis:** Similar to the EPS trends, recent revenue and profit margins have decreased, particularly in the latest quarter (2025-03-31).  While equity has increased, the Return on Equity (ROE) has declined significantly, indicating less efficient use of capital. This aligns with the earnings data and highlights a potential concern for investors.

**7. Overall Analysis & Conclusion**

Tesla (TSLA) has demonstrated exceptional historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent data suggests a potential short-term pullback:

*   **Strengths:** High long-term expected return (350%), historically high alpha generation, significant brand recognition, growing EV market.
*   **Weaknesses:** Recent decline in EPS, revenue, and profit margins, overbought RSI, negative short-term relative divergence, high volatility (MDD).

**Investment Recommendation:**  Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. While TSLA offers significant long-term growth potential, the recent weakness in earnings and technical indicators suggests potential for a short-term correction.

*   **Long-Term Investors:**  Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk and capitalize on potential dips. The Hybrid Signal recommends a small monthly investment.
*   **Short-Term Traders:**  Be aware of the overbought conditions and potential for volatility. Consider waiting for a more favorable entry point.
