**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1292.88%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1174.5%, placing it at the 71.1 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility in Tesla's performance (CAGR and MDD).  The consistently low Beta (around 0.1) suggests that the stock's price movements are less correlated with the overall market compared to most stocks.  The high Alpha values, particularly during certain periods, highlight significant outperformance compared to the benchmark. However, the negative CAGR values in the last two years represent a significant drop.  Note that a low Beta might not always be desirable, especially if it correlates to high idiosyncratic risk.

* 20-Day Moving Average: $417.52
* 60-Day Moving Average: $359.06

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend.  However, the relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day averages may indicate some consolidation.

* Expected Return (2+ years): 365.2% –  This represents a significant potential excess return compared to the S&P 500.  However, this projection is highly uncertain and depends heavily on future market conditions and Tesla's performance.  It's crucial to temper enthusiasm and consider the high inherent risk associated with such a projection.

A thorough due diligence, encompassing a deeper examination of the company's financials, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is essential before making any investment decisions. The recent earnings show some volatility but overall high revenue;  further analysis is needed for a comprehensive conclusion.  The significant fluctuations in ROE need further understanding.
