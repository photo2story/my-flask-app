## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1136.42%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 125.6%.  The difference in cumulative return is a significant **1010.82%**.  The relative divergence (58.59%) indicates that TSLA's performance is considerably higher than the S&P 500 historically, although this is relative to past performance ranges and doesn't predict future performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $346.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $329.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $287.4
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $250.1

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  However, the significant gap between the current price and the longer-term moving averages warrants caution.  The rapid increase from the 60-day moving average suggests a recent price surge, which could be indicative of market volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (72.22):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (1.59):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+24.77):**  Shows a recent strong upward trend.

The combination of a high RSI and a positive PPO indicates strong momentum, but the overbought RSI suggests caution. The strong recent price surge needs further monitoring to asses the sustainability of this trend.  The $346.0 closing price does indeed reflect a period of rapid price appreciation, consistent with a potentially unsustainable trend requiring a deeper investigation.

Revenue has generally been consistent in recent quarters, although there is some fluctuation.  EPS is also somewhat variable, and further analysis of the earnings reports is necessary to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations and to compare them to analyst expectations.  The provided data lacks the expected EPS figure for a comprehensive comparison.


**5. Financial Information:**

**5.1. Revenue and Profitability:**

The revenue is fairly stable, fluctuating around $25B. Profit margins show some variability, ranging from 17.35% to 19.84%. A deeper dive into the reasons for these fluctuations would be beneficial.

**5.2. Capital and Profitability:**

Equity is showing growth; however, Return on Equity (ROE) is highly variable, suggesting underlying business changes.  A further analysis of the factors influencing ROE is needed. The significant jump in ROE from 2024Q1 to 2024Q4 requires investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires real-time data.  Please provide links to recent news articles or financial reports so I can incorporate relevant information about recent earnings announcements, analyst opinions, and market outlook.)*  I need to access current news sources (Shacknews, FINBOLD, etc.) to provide a detailed analysis of recent news and market sentiment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has shown exceptional historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests potential short-term volatility. Technical indicators point to strong momentum but also the risk of a correction. While the company shows generally stable revenue, a more in-depth analysis is needed to understand the fluctuations in profitability, ROE and EPS and whether it is aligned with the company's growth trajectory.  A review of recent news and analyst opinions is essential to assess the current market sentiment and future prospects.  The provided long-term expected return of 101.61% over the S&P 500 is significant but must be considered in light of the potential for short-term volatility.  A thorough understanding of recent earnings calls, analyst forecasts, and overall market conditions is crucial for forming a well-informed investment decision.
