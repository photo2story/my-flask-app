**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 34.0% | 14.2% | 5.0% | 0.0 | 66.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 46.0% | 21.0% | 28.0% | 0.3 | 71.4 |
| 2017-2019  | 48.0% | 21.0% | 18.0% | 0.9 | 89.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 1069.0% | 21.1% | 1042.0% | 0.2 | 756.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 1463.0% | 21.1% | 1393.0% | 0.1 | 1133.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 238.0% | 36.6% | 229.0% | 0.2 | 396.2 |
| 2021-2023  | -456.0% | 36.6% | -479.0% | 0.8 | 799.2 |
| 2022-2024  | -59.0% | 36.6% | -92.0% | 0.8 | 1299.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 386.0% | 24.5% | 328.0% | 1.1 | 1063.2 |


The extremely high alpha values in certain periods, particularly 2018-2021, highlight substantial outperformance. However, the negative CAGR in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 demonstrates periods of significant underperformance.  The increasing Beta suggests increasing market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $330.53
* **Previous Close:** $337.80
* **Change:** -$2.15 (a -0.64% decrease)
* **5-day moving average:** $347.48
* **20-day moving average:** $367.21
* **60-day moving average:** $392.42

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 30.74 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO:** -0.715 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.4% – This confirms a short-term downtrend.

The price decrease (-$2.15) reflects a minor price drop, not a significant event like a crash.  However, combined with the other indicators, it reinforces the current bearish trend. The expected return of 638.7% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 reflects the potential for substantial outperformance, but the significant risk should be noted.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18 B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18 B      |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46 | $25.50 B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.46 | $25.50 B      |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30 B      |

There appears to be some duplication in the provided data.  Further analysis requires clarifying the reporting periods and ensuring data accuracy. Revenue is relatively stable but EPS shows some fluctuation.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B  | 16.26%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B  | 19.84%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B  | 17.95%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B  | 17.35%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B  | 17.63%        |

Revenue is relatively consistent, except for a dip in Q1 2024. Profit margins fluctuate but remain generally healthy.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE     |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B  | 3.23%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B  | 3.10%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B  | 2.22%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38B  | 1.75%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B  | 12.66%  |

Equity is steadily increasing, but ROE is volatile, with a significant drop in recent quarters.  The exceptionally high ROE in Q4 2023 requires further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows a history of substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent performance reveals a downtrend supported by technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages, and relative divergence). While the long-term projected return remains high, the current market sentiment is negative. The financial data shows some inconsistencies and requires further scrutiny to fully assess the company's financial health.  Investors should carefully consider the substantial risk associated with TSLA's high volatility before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons for recent underperformance and the exceptionally high ROE in Q4 2023 is warranted.
