**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $479.86
* **Last Market Price:** $467.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $444.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $378.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $299.70

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the relatively large gap between the current price and the 60-day average indicates recent volatility.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price suggests a recent increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 90.01 –  This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO:** 1.718 –  A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +15.0 – Shows a recent increase in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 753.0% – This represents a significant expected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This should be interpreted cautiously, as it's a projection and not a guaranteed outcome.

The Last-market price of $467.18 being higher than the 5-day, 20-day and 60-day moving averages supports the recent increase in price, but the high RSI warns of potential short-term corrections.
