## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1421.18%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.69%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1300.49%, placing it at the 78.4th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (max 1673.1%, min -53.2%).  This indicates TSLA has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but the 78.4% percentile indicates this outperformance is not unprecedented within its historical context.  Alpha consistently shows a small positive value (around 0.1), suggesting slight outperformance compared to the market benchmark. Beta, while fluctuating, generally suggests above-average market volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $438.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $402.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $314.74

The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average warrants caution.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, but its recent performance exhibits volatility. While the current price is above its moving averages, suggesting potential upward momentum, the RSI is approaching overbought territory, and the PPO is slightly bearish, indicating caution. The high expected return is attractive but should be considered in light of the inherent risk associated with TSLA's volatility.  The substantial fluctuations in revenue, EPS, and ROE highlight the need for further analysis of the underlying drivers of these variations.  Missing context, specifically analyst expectations and recent news, hampers a comprehensive assessment.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data provided, TSLA shows a strong historical track record of outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, current indicators suggest caution. The significant price appreciation in the short-term coupled with mixed technical signals and the need for further analysis of earnings, news, and analyst sentiments necessitate a thorough review before making any investment decisions.  The high projected long-term returns must be weighed against significant potential downside risk.
