## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), although recent performance has been volatile.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO): 1053.45% vs 121.84%. This represents a substantial outperformance, with a relative divergence of 931.6 points, placing it in the 57th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided range (max: 1673.1, min: -53.2).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and fluctuating alpha values (market-beating return).  High CAGR values in some years (e.g., 2018-2020, 2019-2021) were driven by substantial Alpha, suggesting significant outperformance. However, negative CAGR values in recent periods (2021-2023 and 2022-2024) and high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicate considerable risk. The relatively high beta values suggest that Tesla's stock price is more sensitive to overall market movements. Note the dramatic shift from high to negative CAGR from 2021-2023, which warrants investigation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $355.84
* **5-day Moving Average:** $345.50
* **20-day Moving Average:** $384.57
* **60-day Moving Average:** $392.12

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price change of -$0.028 (a small drop) doesn't indicate a significant event.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.87):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-1.28):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-1.3):** Shows a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (553.9%):**  Projects a substantial outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) assuming a continued positive trend, significantly above historical average. This prediction should be viewed cautiously, given the volatility demonstrated in the Alpha/Beta analysis.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable EPS and revenue figures over the past few quarters.  However, there is a duplication of data points (2025-01-30 and data points associated with that date), potentially suggesting an error in data entry. More consistent and accurate data is needed for reliable analysis.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.68 | 25.18       |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.46 | 25.50       |
| 2024-04-24 | 0.37 | 21.30       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability show some volatility, but revenue largely remains steady over the period reported. The profit margin fluctuates between 16% and 20%, indicating healthy profitability. Equity is growing steadily, but ROE is significantly lower in recent quarters (except for a high value in 2023-12-31) compared to previous data, suggesting a potential issue or unusual event to investigate.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla has historically shown exceptional growth and significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent performance is characterized by volatility and a downward trend, as evidenced by the moving averages and negative CAGR values in the provided alpha/beta analysis.  While the long-term outlook remains potentially positive (indicated by the expected return), significant risks are associated with the investment due to the high volatility and potential for large drawdowns.  The duplicated data in recent earnings requires clarification.   The sharp decline in ROE warrants further investigation to understand underlying factors driving the trend.  A thorough due diligence incorporating additional financial data and broader market analysis is crucial before making any investment decisions.
