## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Tesla, Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  This report analyzes Tesla's performance based on provided financial data, comparing its returns to the S&P 500 (VOO), evaluating its recent price movements, and assessing key financial indicators.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

Tesla (TSLA) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for TSLA is 1113.34%, while VOO's is 120.63%.  The difference (992.7%) places TSLA at the 60.6th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the VOO (max: 1673.1%, min: -53.2%).


The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data reveals periods of exceptional growth (e.g., 1069% and 1463% between 2018-2020 and 2019-2021, respectively) intermixed with periods of substantial decline (e.g., -456% between 2021-2023).  Alpha values fluctuate significantly, indicating varying degrees of outperformance relative to the market (beta reflects market sensitivity), and the market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth throughout the period.  High Alpha values in several years highlight periods of significant outperformance.  However, the high volatility in both CAGR and Alpha underscores significant risk.  Note that the reported negative CAGR values represent periods of loss, not negative growth.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Current Price:** $374.32
* **Last Market Close:** $369.10 (a -$1.39 decrease, -0.37%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $386.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $401.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $389.99

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price drop of -$1.39 is a relatively small percentage decrease; more data is needed to establish whether this signals a larger trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 32.8 This suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.  However, it's crucial to consider this alongside other indicators.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.13 This negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -5.4% This indicates a recent weakening in price relative to the broader market over the last 20 days.
* **Expected Return:** 496% This represents a substantial projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 assuming continued strong growth.  This is a high-risk, high-reward prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies, possibly due to reporting periods or data entry errors.

A more reliable and complete dataset is needed for a robust analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla has shown periods of exceptional growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance has been highly volatile, with periods of substantial gains followed by significant losses. Current technical indicators suggest potential for a rebound, but the overall picture remains uncertain.  The inconsistency in earnings data and significant fluctuations in ROE require further investigation and a more complete dataset.  The high predicted long-term return should be considered cautiously given the inherent risk of investing in a company with such a volatile history.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough review of financial statements, industry trends and future market projections are necessary.  Any investment should only be made within the context of a balanced, diversified portfolio.
