| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $282.16
* 5-Day Moving Average: $280.91
* 20-Day Moving Average: $256.58
* 60-Day Moving Average: $281.86

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but significantly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a recent upward trend after a period of consolidation or slight decline.  The last market day shows a price drop of $3.38, which needs to be considered further.  The price is in a relatively narrow range currently.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.06 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 2.5 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.6% (Short-term upward trend)

The provided data shows a healthy technical outlook.  The negative change in the 'Last-market' data (-$3.38) suggests a slight downward correction, but the overall indicators still point towards a relatively positive outlook.  This requires further investigation to validate if this is simply short-term volatility or the beginning of a larger trend reversal.  The expected return of 479.8% over the long-term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is incredibly high and should be approached with significant skepticism. Such high returns are unlikely and require additional justification and a careful analysis of the underlying assumptions.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-04-23 | $0.13 | $19.34B       |

| 2025-01-30 | $0.46 | $25.50B       |

There's a noticeable fluctuation in EPS and some duplicate entries which needs clarification.  A more comprehensive analysis requires additional data and a deeper examination of the reasons behind these fluctuations. The revenue figures show some consistency, indicating a fairly stable revenue stream, but further investigation into the underlying drivers is needed.

| 2024-03-31  | $64.38B     | 2.16%  |

Equity is increasing, but ROE shows some fluctuation.  The low ROE in Q1 2025 warrants further investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has been exceptionally strong compared to the S&P 500, demonstrating significantly higher cumulative returns and alpha. However, the exceptionally high CAGR figures from 2018 onwards require further scrutiny.  The recent price action indicates a potential short-term correction, though technical indicators suggest a relatively positive outlook.  However, the reported high expected return should be treated with caution.  Earnings data shows inconsistencies that need clarification and deeper analysis.  Financial data reveals some fluctuations in revenue and ROE, demanding further investigation to understand underlying factors. Overall, while Tesla's past performance has been impressive,  a more detailed and comprehensive analysis, including external factors and validation of the provided data is needed for a complete and reliable evaluation.  The provided data contains irregularities which require additional information to resolve.
