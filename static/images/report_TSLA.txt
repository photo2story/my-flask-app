**1) Performance Comparison:**

Tesla's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 2633.79% for TSLA versus 87.98% for VOO.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows exceptionally high growth compared to the S&P 500, evidenced by its significantly higher cumulative return and high CAGR values. However,  high MDD values highlight the inherent risk associated with this investment.  Recent price movement suggests a short-term upward trend, but RSI indicates a potential near-term correction.  Strong revenue but fluctuating EPS and ROE, suggest solid revenue growth but potential volatility in profitability. The high projected long-term return is promising but must be considered in the context of the inherent risk and potential for short-term corrections.  A more detailed and robust analysis requires accurate and complete data, particularly regarding earnings.  Investors should carefully weigh the high growth potential against the substantial risk before investing.
