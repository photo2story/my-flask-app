## Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Report

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 2160.3%, indicating a substantial outperformance.  The relative divergence of 71.7% (on a scale where 100% represents the maximum historical divergence) shows that the current outperformance is considerable compared to historical data.  However, this does not guarantee future performance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, particularly between 2018 and 2021, showcasing periods of exceptional growth. However,  Alpha values fluctuate, suggesting periods of both outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the market. Beta values generally remain relatively low, indicating a level of market sensitivity.  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects Tesla's growth over the period.

Tesla's performance has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, showing strong growth potential.  However, recent price movements indicate a potential short-term downturn.

This report should be considered preliminary and further research is needed before making any investment decisions.
