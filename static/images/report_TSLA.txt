**0. Key Figures & Preliminary Analysis:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data reveals significantly higher returns for TSLA compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) index.  Further analysis is required to determine the sustainability and risk associated with these returns.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 1148.89%

* **Relative Divergence:** 65.2% (This indicates that TSLA's performance relative to VOO is in the upper 65th percentile of its historical range).
* **Alpha & Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows high Alpha values (particularly in 2018-2021), suggesting significant outperformance relative to the market (beta). However, the substantial fluctuation in CAGR and significant negative returns in 2021-2023 highlight significant risk and volatility associated with TSLA.  Note that Beta also increased significantly in the last 2 years indicating increased market sensitivity.  Market cap is highly variable suggesting periods of significant growth and contraction.

The recent price shows a short-term upward trend (above the 20-day MA), but still below the 5-day and 60-day MAs, suggesting a potential correction or consolidation phase.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has demonstrated exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, particularly over the 2018-2021 period.

While recent price action and some technical indicators suggest a potential positive short-term trend, the high expected return should be interpreted cautiously due to the inherent volatility.  Further due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions, including a thorough examination of the company's financial health, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects. The provided data is incomplete and requires additional context and verification for a more comprehensive evaluation.  The duplicated data points for Q1 and Q4 2025 require clarification.
