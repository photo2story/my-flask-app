Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1217.15%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.47%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1104.7%, placing it at the 67.1st percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500 (based on the provided maximum and minimum values).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility and significant swings in performance. While Alpha consistently remains low (around 0.1), the Beta fluctuates wildly, reflecting Tesla's high sensitivity to market movements, especially in the period between 2018 and 2021. The high Beta values during this period, coupled with extremely high CAGR, are indicative of exceptional growth, but also of considerable risk. The negative CAGR in 2021-2023 highlights a period of significant underperformance.  The more recent data shows signs of recovery.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $399.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $424.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $346.00

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 41.67 (Below 50, indicating bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -2.06 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.1 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 412.3% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is projected over the long term, but this must be viewed in light of the high risk associated with Tesla)

Given the current price of $403.31, there is no indication of a significant recent price jump (up or down).  The projected return is exceptionally high,  but it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and potential for significant losses.

The high Beta underscores the importance of diversification within any investment portfolio that includes Tesla.
