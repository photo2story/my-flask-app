*   **60-day SMA:** 419.9986

**Analysis:**

The current price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This *could* be interpreted as a short-term bearish signal. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and the 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, further supporting this potential short-term downtrend. The recent slight price decrease from the previous close reinforces this observation.

**Analysis:**

*   **Overall:** While Tesla has shown remarkable growth and innovation, the recent data and news suggest that investors should proceed with caution. The stock is potentially oversold, which could present a buying opportunity, but the underlying financial performance and competitive landscape warrant careful consideration.
