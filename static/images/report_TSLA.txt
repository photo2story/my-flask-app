## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA (1227.83%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 52.12%.  The difference is 1175.7 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 64.9% indicates that TSLA's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range.  However, the provided alpha and beta values show inconsistent performance year over year and require further investigation to understand these fluctuations.  While some periods show significantly higher returns (alpha), others show substantially negative returns.  This high volatility is reflected in the significant maximum drawdown (MDD) observed across the provided periods.  The high beta (around 1.0 consistently) suggests that TSLA's price is highly correlated with the overall market.  The considerable market capitalization shows the scale of the company.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $406.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $416.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $414.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $370.70

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The price has recently decreased slightly, as evidenced by the last market data.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.50 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.62 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -1.7 (Short-term downward trend)

The recent price change shows a small decrease (-$1.41). While not a drastic drop to warrant labelling as a "sharp decline," it contributes to the overall bearish sentiment indicated by the PPO and the relative divergence change. The expected return of 468.2% over the long term (2+ years) significantly exceeds the S&P 500's projected return, suggesting substantial potential for outperformance. This projection, however, must be viewed cautiously due to the inherent volatility of TSLA.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While revenue generally remains high, EPS fluctuates.  There is a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24 which needs clarification. A detailed analysis requires more historical data to determine trends and seasonality in earnings.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18B     |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46 | $25.50B     |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30B     |
| 2023-10-23 | $0.58 | $23.35B     |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.58 | $23.35B     | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals some inconsistencies.  While revenue remains relatively stable, profit margins show some fluctuations but generally maintain a healthy level.  The Return on Equity (ROE) exhibits significant variability. The high ROE in 2023-12-31 is followed by lower ROEs in subsequent quarters. This requires deeper investigation into the underlying reasons for these fluctuations, such as changes in investment strategies, debt levels, or operational efficiency.

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin | Equity      | ROE     |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | $25.18B     | 19.84%        | $69.93B     | 3.10%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $25.50B     | 17.95%        | $66.47B     | 2.22%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $21.30B     | 17.35%        | $64.38B     | 1.75%   |
| 2023-12-31  | $25.17B     | 17.63%        | $62.63B     | 12.66%  |
| 2023-09-30  | $23.35B     | 17.89%        | $53.47B     | 3.47%   |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA demonstrates exceptionally high growth potential relative to the S&P 500, but this comes with significant volatility.  The recent price movement shows a short-term downtrend, although technical indicators are not definitively bearish.  The company's financial performance exhibits strong revenue, but the profitability and ROE show some inconsistencies that warrant further scrutiny.  Long-term investors should consider TSLA's high potential but acknowledge the substantial risk associated with its volatile nature.  Further analysis involving a more complete historical dataset, along with detailed examination of the discrepancies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entry and fluctuating ROE), is essential before forming a comprehensive investment strategy.  A deeper dive into Tesla's strategic initiatives, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment would further enhance the analysis.
