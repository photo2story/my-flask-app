* **20-Day Moving Average:** 329.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 269.68

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day averages hints at consolidation or a slight upward movement rather than an explosive rally.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.21 – Slightly above neutral territory (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** -0.57 – Negative value indicating bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:**  `nan` (Not Available) -  Lack of data prevents analysis.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1099.3% - This represents a significant projected outperformance against the S&P 500, if this forecast is accurate. However,  such a high projected return should be treated with considerable skepticism and not considered a guaranteed outcome.  It is crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided '351.55' (Last-market) is slightly higher than the closing price, and there is no need to consider a sudden change in market condition based on a small difference.

The reported earnings show some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, with peaks in Q2 2024 and Q4 2023, indicating some seasonality.
* **EPS:** EPS shows some variability with the highest EPS in Q4 2024 and significant drops in the following quarters. There is some ambiguity between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024 reporting, needing clarification.
* **Overall:**  Without comparing to expectations, a conclusive statement cannot be made, but the data suggests some inconsistent financial performance in recent quarters.  More information about the expectations during each quarter is needed for a complete analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, while profit margins have generally been steady around 18%, with a peak in Q3 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity shows growth but ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates significantly, reaching a high of 12.66% in Q4 2023 and much lower in subsequent quarters. This volatility in ROE warrants further investigation into underlying factors.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla (TSLA) shows a history of extraordinary growth relative to the S&P 500 but with considerable volatility. Recent performance displays some inconsistencies, indicated by fluctuating revenue, EPS, and ROE.  The high projected return must be viewed with caution, as such high returns are rarely sustainable long-term.  Technical indicators provide a mixed signal, with an RSI suggesting neutrality and a negative PPO signaling bearish momentum. Missing information about analyst expectations and current market sentiment prevents a complete assessment.  The substantial divergence from the S&P 500, though impressive historically, doesn't guarantee future outperformance.  Further analysis is required, including a review of the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and overall economic conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment of Tesla's prospects.  The provided data shows considerable volatility; investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.
