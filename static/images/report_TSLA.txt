2024-12-20 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1348.30%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 114.36%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1233.94%.  The relative divergence of 74.5% indicates that TSLA's performance is in the upper percentiles compared to the S&P 500's historical performance.  However, this is a relative measure and doesn't represent a future guarantee.  The provided alpha values consistently suggest outperformance relative to the market benchmark. The Beta values show a high volatility and market sensitivity, increasing dramatically over the observed period.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $440.13
* **Last Market Price:** $434.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $447.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $383.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $302.80

The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The difference between the closing and last market price is minimal, suggesting no significant recent volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.37 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.08 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.3% (Short-term upward trend)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a correction.  The positive PPO reinforces the bullish momentum.  The positive relative divergence change supports the short-term upward trend.  Given the last market price of $434.29, there's no indication of a dramatic price movement (sudden surge or drop). The projected return of 828% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is exceptionally high and should be viewed with caution.  Such high projected returns are rarely achieved and are subject to significant risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some fluctuation in both revenue and EPS.  Revenue shows a general upward trend, although Q1 2024 shows a dip compared to the preceding quarter.

No significant beats or misses can be confirmed from this limited data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance significantly surpasses the S&P 500, but this exceptional growth comes with inherent volatility and high risk.  While technical indicators show mixed signals (bullish PPO and overbought RSI), the recent price action suggests a possible short-term correction.  The company's financial performance shows fluctuations in revenue and EPS, but generally upward trends in some key metrics (revenue, equity). The lack of information on recent news and analyst opinions limits the scope of this analysis.  The extremely high projected return should be treated with skepticism and considered alongside significant risk.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain the sustainability of this performance and potential future growth.  Investors should conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.
