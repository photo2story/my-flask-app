## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  This report analyzes Tesla's performance, comparing its returns to the S&P 500 (VOO), examining recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial information.  Tesla exhibits significantly higher returns than the S&P 500, but also higher volatility.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla's cumulative return (2357.82%) drastically outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (66.27%). The difference (2291.6) is substantially higher than the historical range, placing Tesla at the 75.6th percentile of its relative performance against the S&P 500.  This suggests significant outperformance, but also considerable risk.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and substantial MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across the analyzed periods.  The positive alpha values, particularly in recent years (2018-2025), indicate consistent outperformance relative to the market. However, the high beta values (especially in earlier years), show significant market sensitivity. Capitalization (Cap) shows considerable growth throughout the period.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $254.11
* **5-day Moving Average:** $256.67
* **20-day Moving Average:** $257.59
* **60-day Moving Average:** $305.65

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change of $0.70 represents a minor increase from the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.77 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.77 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +9.6% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 606.1% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 expected over the long term)

The indicators suggest a mixed signal. While the PPO and relative strength indicate bullish momentum, the RSI is near neutral and the price is below its moving averages, suggesting caution. The significant expected return reflects the historical outperformance but carries significant risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies.  There are duplicate entries for Jan 30, 2025, and some quarters reporting the same EPS/revenue.  More complete and consistent data is needed for a robust analysis.


| 날짜       | EPS | 매출         |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.68 | $25.18 B     |
| 2025-01-30 | 0.68 | $25.18 B     |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.46 | $25.50 B     |
| 2025-01-30 | 0.46 | $25.50 B     |
| 2024-04-24 | 0.37 | $21.30 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals a generally healthy revenue stream, but profitability metrics (ROE and profit margins) show some variability across quarters.  The substantial jump in ROE from Q1 2024 to Q4 2023 warrants further investigation.  Equity has been steadily increasing over the observed period.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B | 16.26% |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B | 19.84% |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B | 17.95% |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B | 17.35% |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B | 17.63% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B | 3.23% |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B | 3.10% |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B | 2.22% |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38B | 1.75% |
| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B | 12.66% |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Tesla shows remarkable historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by high cumulative returns and positive alpha. However, this comes with substantial volatility, reflected in high beta values and significant maximum drawdowns. Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, while technical indicators provide mixed signals.  While long-term prospects look positive based on the expected return, careful consideration of the inherent risk is crucial.  Further analysis with more complete and consistent earnings data is needed for a more comprehensive evaluation. The inconsistent earnings data and fluctuations in profitability metrics warrant additional investigation.
