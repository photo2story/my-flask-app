**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Tesla's stock presents a mixed picture. The company has historically delivered *massive* outperformance compared to the S&P 500, as seen in the cumulative returns. The strong Alpha values in many periods reinforce this point. However, this comes with significant volatility, indicated by the higher Beta values and Maximum Drawdown figures.

Recent news highlights both positive and negative developments. The positive headlines regarding Model Y and a potential trend reversal are encouraging.  However, concerning news about declining deliveries and analyst concerns about overvaluation cannot be ignored.

Technically, the stock is showing a potential rebound but remains below short-term moving averages. The RSI is neutral. The MRI suggests medium risk.

Fundamentally, revenue and equity are generally increasing, but EPS and ROE have fluctuated. The analyst consensus is neutral (Hold), with an average price target below the current market price, suggesting limited upside or even potential downside risk.

**Conclusion:**

Tesla remains a high-growth, high-risk investment. Its past performance is exceptional, and the expected return remains optimistic. However, the recent challenges in deliveries, analyst concerns about valuation, and fluctuating EPS figures warrant caution. The "Hold" consensus reflects this uncertainty.

**Recommendation:**

The provided "Hybrid Signal" suggesting full investment with monthly additions is an aggressive strategy. A more conservative approach would be to carefully consider the risks, perhaps allocating a smaller portion of a portfolio to TSLA while closely monitoring future news, earnings reports, and technical indicators. Further research into the reasons behind declining deliveries and the analyst's overvaluation concerns is highly recommended before making any investment decision.
