Given the high long-term expected return but also the identified risks, a cautious approach is warranted. The "Hold" consensus from analysts seems appropriate. Investors should closely monitor upcoming earnings, financial performance, and news developments before making significant investment decisions. Consider the hybrid signal's advice to reduce holdings slightly and maintain a high cash position.
