* **Closing Price:** 339.64
* **Last Market Price:** 352.57
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 337.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 297.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 254.54

The price is currently below the last market price, indicating a recent decline. The price is above the 5-day moving average, but significantly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.03 (Approaching overbought territory)
