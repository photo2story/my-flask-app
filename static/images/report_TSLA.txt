## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1255.69%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference in cumulative return is 1139.3 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, sits at the 69.1st percentile, indicating a substantial outperformance relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures for TSLA, especially between 2018 and 2021, but also significant volatility and negative returns in recent years (2021-2024). The consistently low beta (around 0.1) suggests low correlation with the overall market, meaning its price movements are relatively independent of broad market trends.  However, the extremely high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures highlight the considerable risk associated with investing in TSLA.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA shows exceptionally high growth potential and significant outperformance against the S&P 500, particularly in the longer term.  However, this comes with considerable risk, as demonstrated by its high volatility and substantial drawdowns.  The recent technical indicators suggest a potential short-term upward trend, but the stock might be overbought in the longer term.  Further investigation is needed to clarify inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings data and volatile ROE).  A long-term investment strategy, coupled with a thorough understanding of the inherent risks, is crucial for considering TSLA.  The high projected return should be considered alongside the possibility of substantial losses.
