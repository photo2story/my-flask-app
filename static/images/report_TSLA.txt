## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Performance Review

**0. Overview:** Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return (813.94%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (112.87%).  The difference is 701.1%, placing it at the 43.7th percentile of historical divergence based on a range of 1673.1 (max) to -53.2 (min).  This indicates strong outperformance relative to the broader market, though this is not guaranteed to continue.


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance and market sensitivity which changed significantly over time.  While high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is shown in some periods (exceeding 1000%), the negative CAGR in 2021-2023 highlights significant risk.  The high Beta values in several periods, especially in recent years, suggest substantial market sensitivity.  The substantial fluctuations in Alpha highlight the inconsistent outperformance relative to the market benchmark.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $281.95
* **Previous Close:** $290.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $308.78
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $351.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $390.19

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price drop of $3.04 from the previous close is notable.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 21.16 – Indicates oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.11 – Suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -13.1% - Shows a recent short-term downtrend in relative performance against the market.
* **Expected Return:** 876.6% - A very high expected return over the long term (2+ years), significantly exceeding the S&P 500. This figure requires further clarification on its calculation methodology to assess its reliability.  The high volatility shown in the historical data makes this projection highly uncertain.

The significant price drop ('change' value) highlights a potential issue impacting investor sentiment.  While an oversold RSI might suggest a potential rebound, this is not guaranteed given the substantial negative momentum and other factors.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue around $25B but fluctuating EPS.  There's a need for more detailed analysis to understand the reasons behind the EPS variations. Further information, such as cost of goods sold and operating expenses, would be needed for a thorough financial analysis.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18 B     |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18 B     |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46 | $25.50 B     |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.46 | $25.50 B     |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals some inconsistencies. While revenue remains relatively stable, the profit margin fluctuates.  More concerning is the significant drop in ROE (Return on Equity) from Q4 2023 (12.66%) to subsequent quarters, potentially indicating challenges in profitability. Further investigation into the factors influencing this decrease is necessary.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B | 16.26%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B | 19.84%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B | 17.95%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B | 17.35%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B | 17.63%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE     |
|---------|----------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B | 3.23%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B | 3.10%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B | 2.22%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38B | 1.75%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B | 12.66%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock has historically shown significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, although this has been highly volatile and subject to substantial fluctuations.  Recent price action and indicators suggest a bearish trend. While the high projected long-term return is enticing, the high volatility and the inconsistencies in financial metrics (particularly the sharp drop in ROE) raise concerns.  A deeper dive into the company's financial statements, industry comparisons, and qualitative factors is needed to form a more informed investment decision.  The provided data alone is insufficient to definitively recommend or reject investment in TSLA.  The high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution given the inherent risks.
