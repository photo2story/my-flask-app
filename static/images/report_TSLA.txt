**8. Overall Summary:**

Tesla shows a history of exceptionally high growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent performance has weakened considerably.  While the long-term outlook remains potentially strong based on the high expected return (101.82%), the current high RSI and the recent negative trends in CAGR and Alpha indicate potential near-term risk.  More recent news and analyst sentiment are crucial to fully assess the current investment suitability.  Thorough due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decision.  The data suggests high volatility, making it a riskier investment than the S&P 500.
