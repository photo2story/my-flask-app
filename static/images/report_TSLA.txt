## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1348.30%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 114.36%. The difference in cumulative return between TSLA and VOO is 1233.94%.  The relative divergence of 74.5% indicates that TSLA's performance is in the upper percentiles of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha values consistently show a positive outperformance relative to the market, though the beta values suggest significant market sensitivity, particularly in recent periods. Note the highly volatile CAGR values highlighting extreme year-over-year fluctuations.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $440.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $447.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $383.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $302.80

The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend, but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The gap between the shorter-term and longer-term averages suggests recent volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.37 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.08 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +3.3% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 828% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 anticipated, though this requires careful consideration given inherent uncertainties)

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and susceptible to a correction.  However, the positive PPO and recent relative divergence suggest continued upward momentum in the short-term. The high expected return is very optimistic and hinges on maintaining the current, unusually high, growth rate.  The current price of $440.13 is near the recent highs, raising concern about potential volatility (either a sharp correction or a continued, though perhaps less dramatic, rise).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both revenue and EPS:

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, peaking in Q2 2024.

* **Trends:**  No clear consistent upward or downward trend is easily observable in either revenue or EPS based solely on the provided data.  Further analysis with longer-term data is required to understand broader trends and the effect of any seasonality.  A more robust assessment would need to include an analysis of projected earnings and compare actual performance to analyst expectations.
