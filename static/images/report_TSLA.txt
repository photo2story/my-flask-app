## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**0) Summary Statistics:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows significantly higher returns for TSLA compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with considerable volatility.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term bearish trend, but long-term prospects remain positive based on projected returns.


**1) Return Rate Comparison & Divergence:**

* **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 2340.80%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.69%
* **Return Difference:** 2274.11% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns at the end of the period)
* **Relative Divergence:** 75.0% (Indicates TSLA's performance is in the 75th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500, based on the provided range).

The provided alpha and beta values show a highly volatile stock with periods of significant outperformance against the market (high alpha during 2018-2021), and periods of underperformance (negative alpha in earlier years). The beta, which measures volatility relative to the market, is consistently high, indicating substantial risk.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) demonstrates substantial growth over the analyzed period.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $250.22
* **20-day Moving Average:** $256.15
* **60-day Moving Average:** $308.53

The price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price change of $0.02 is negligible and does not indicate a significant price event (no evidence of a rapid jump or fall).

* **Expected Return:** 616.0% (Long-term (2+ years) expected return exceeding the S&P 500)


The conflicting signals from RSI and PPO suggest a period of uncertainty.  The MRI and relative divergence indicate potential risk in the near term. However, the high expected return suggests a positive outlook for long-term investors.
