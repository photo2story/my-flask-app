## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA (1242.43%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (117.62%). The difference is 1124.8%, placing it at the 68.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates that TSLA has substantially outperformed the market benchmark over the observed period, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for various periods, particularly between 2018-2021. However, the significant negative CAGR in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 highlight substantial volatility. The consistently low beta values suggest relatively low correlation with the overall market, though this fluctuates considerably with market capitalization (Cap(B)).  The alpha is consistently around 0.1, implying a modest outperformance compared to the market, again keeping in mind the data volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $411.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $404.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $425.00
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $334.47

The price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term bearish trend.  The 5-day moving average being closer to the current price indicates some recent price stabilization or recovery.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.13 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning towards the lower end of the neutral range.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -2.40 – A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -4.5 – Indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative strength compared to the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 400.4% – This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon,  assuming consistent past trend continuation, which is unlikely to be a consistent trend going forward.  This projection requires critical analysis and should not be taken as a guaranteed return.  High volatility significantly impacts such long-term projections.  The current price of $411.05 does not suggest immediate extremely bullish or bearish signals based on this data alone.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue:

* **Revenue:**  Revenue shows some volatility but generally remains high throughout the observed period, exceeding $21B in each quarter.
* **EPS:** EPS also shows volatility, with a notable drop in Q1 2024. However, there's a subsequent increase in Q2 and Q3 2024.  There is a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24.

**Without comparing against analyst expectations (not provided), it's impossible to definitively label any specific quarter as a "beat" or "miss."**  The provided data only shows reported values.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively consistent, but profit margins show some fluctuation, peaking at 19.84% in Q3 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is growing, but Return on Equity (ROE) exhibits significant volatility, dropping dramatically in 2024 Q1 and Q2.  This substantial change warrants further investigation into underlying causes.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news releases (within the last two days), market outlook analysis and analyst opinions.  This data was not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing periods of exceptional growth offset by considerable volatility.  Recent price action suggests a possible short-term bearish trend, although indicators are not strongly bearish.  Earnings show some fluctuation, and ROE needs further investigation for the significant drop in the most recent quarters.  Crucially, additional data on market sentiment, analyst predictions, and recent news is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.  The high volatility and significant past outperformance should be considered carefully before making investment decisions, as past performance is not indicative of future results.
