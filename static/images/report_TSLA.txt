2024-11-29 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1089.58%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%. The difference is 960.7%, placing it at the 55.8th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -54.5% and a maximum difference of 1763.9%).  This indicates strong outperformance historically, but this is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows considerable volatility in TSLA's performance relative to the market. While several periods exhibit extremely high growth,  recent performance (2021-2024) shows significantly lower growth, and even negative growth in the last year.  The high beta consistently above 3 indicates substantial sensitivity to market movements.  The Alpha values, though generally positive, fluctuate widely, highlighting the unpredictable nature of TSLA's returns independent of market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $332.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $340.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $313.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $263.07

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend.  However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential support levels.  The relatively large gap between the 5-day and 20-day MA suggests recent price volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 60.63 –  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, sitting in neutral territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.55 – Indicates bearish momentum, although relatively close to neutral.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +14.1 – Suggests a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 1152.5% – This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500, assuming continued strong growth.  This is highly speculative and depends heavily on future performance.  The actual realized return is highly uncertain.  The provided 332.79 price does not suggest any significant, sudden price movements (no evidence of a sharp rise or fall).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some inconsistencies. There are duplicate entries for October 24th, 2024.  Assuming one is a typo, the trend shows:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates between approximately $21.30B and $25.50B.  There is no clear consistent upward trend over these quarters.
* **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Shows some variability, peaking at $0.68 in Q4 2024 and reaching a low of $0.37 in Q1 2024.  Again, no consistent upward trend is evident.  


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates but generally shows decent levels. Profit margins are relatively stable around 17-20%, although there's a noticeable drop to 17.35% in Q1 2024 before an increase in Q2 and Q3 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows growth, but ROE (Return on Equity) displays considerable volatility, with a significant jump to 12.66% in Q4 2023 followed by a decline in subsequent quarters.  This instability warrants further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news, market outlook and analyst opinions, which is not included in the provided data.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly. However, recent data shows a slowdown in growth and price volatility.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook. Earnings data displays some fluctuation but without clear, consistent trends. The high beta and volatile ROE suggest considerable risk. The projected long-term return is highly speculative and relies on assumptions about future performance that may or may not materialize.  Further research into recent news, analyst ratings and a more complete financial picture are crucial before making any investment decisions.
