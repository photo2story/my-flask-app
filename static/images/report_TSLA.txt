## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return for TSLA is 1110.48%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 124.78%. The difference is 985.7%, placing it at the 57.2nd percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (max: 1763.87, min: -54.48).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for TSLA over various periods, significantly exceeding the market (as reflected by the high alpha).  Beta values generally hover around 1.3-1.9, suggesting that TSLA's price movements are more volatile than the overall market (higher beta implies higher volatility).  The recent decline in CAGR (2021-2024) and negative alpha in the most recent period (2022-2024) signal a period of underperformance relative to the market.


| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |

| 2016-2018  | 49.0%  | 32.3%  | 16.7%  | 1.3   | 71.2   |
| 2017-2019  | 92.8%  | 47.8%  | 41.1%  | 1.4   | 89.5   |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $338.74 (Last Market: $338.87)
* 5-Day Moving Average: $325.87
* 20-Day Moving Average: $281.00
* 60-Day Moving Average: $247.88

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend, but the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates the momentum might be slowing down.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 70.45 (Approaching overbought territory)
* PPO: 1.69 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* 20-Day Relative Strength Change: +23.21 (Strong recent upward movement)
* Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years): 101.42% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 expected)

The RSI nearing 70 suggests potential short-term overbought conditions.  A significant price increase (to $338.87) coupled with high RSI and PPO indicators could imply a potential short-term pullback or consolidation period, although the long-term outlook remains positive.

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The revenue shows fairly consistent performance, though there's a dip in Q1 2024. Profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 17-20%.  Return on Equity (ROE) has shown significant variability, with a very high ROE in Q4 2023 followed by a decline in subsequent quarters.  Further investigation is needed to understand the causes of this fluctuation.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating strong growth. However, recent performance has shown signs of slowing down. While the recent price action indicates positive momentum, technical indicators suggest potential short-term overbought conditions. Long-term prospects remain positive, based on the expected return exceeding that of the S&P 500, but short-term volatility is expected. A thorough analysis of the latest earnings report relative to analysts' expectations and recent news is crucial for a complete picture of the current situation.  The high beta suggests higher risk.
