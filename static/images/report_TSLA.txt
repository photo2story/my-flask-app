## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1089.58%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 128.86%. The difference in cumulative returns is 960.7%.  This places TSLA at the 90th percentile (55.8% on a relative scale) of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The high relative performance is evidenced by the substantial alpha values consistently above 2 in the provided data.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high alpha values (ranging from 1.0% to 131.3%), indicating significant outperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500) across different periods. The beta values (generally around 3) suggest TSLA is considerably more volatile than the market. Market capitalization has grown substantially over the years, reflecting the company's growth trajectory.  However, the most recent periods (2021-2023 and 2022-2024) show a decline in CAGR and positive alpha, suggesting potential market headwinds.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Close Price:** $332.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $340.38 (Slightly below)
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $313.45 (Above)
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $263.07 (Significantly above)

The price is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting an upward trend, but is slightly below the 5-day moving average, hinting at a potential short-term correction.  The last market price ($332.79) is virtually identical to the close price, indicating minimal price movement at the close of the trading day.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.63 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.55 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +14.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1152.5% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term)


The indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI is neutral and the short-term relative strength is positive, the negative PPO suggests weakening momentum.  The high expected return is contingent upon maintaining the historical trend, which is unlikely to repeat linearly. The difference between the close price and the last market price is negligible and doesn't suggest any significant event driving a rapid price movement.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some fluctuations in both revenue and EPS.  Revenue reached a peak of $25.50B in Q2 2024, but then slightly declined to $25.18B in Q3 2024.  EPS also shows some volatility, with a high of $0.68 in Q3 2024 and a low of $0.37 in Q1 2024. There are duplicate entries for October 2024 which needs clarification.  Overall, the data does not reveal a clear trend of consistent revenue or EPS growth over this short period.  Without comparative data against expectations, it's impossible to assess "beats" or "misses."


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some volatility with the highest revenue being in Q2 2024 at $25.5B.
* **Profit Margin:**  Profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 17-20%, with a peak of 19.84% in Q3 2024.
* **Equity:** Equity has generally increased over time, indicating growth in the company's net worth.
* **ROE:** Return on equity shows significant volatility, ranging from a low of 1.75% to a high of 12.66%. The high ROE in Q4 2023 is noteworthy and requires further investigation for context.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**  This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This information was not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla has shown exceptional growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500 historically. The high alpha consistently demonstrated in the provided data highlights this. However, recent performance (2021-2024) suggests a potential slowdown and increased volatility. While the current price is above several moving averages, suggesting an upward trend,  mixed technical indicators and volatile earnings data warrant cautious optimism. The high expected long-term return requires significant caution, as it assumes the continuation of past extraordinary growth, which may not be sustainable.  Further research is needed to incorporate news, analyst opinions, and a more comprehensive understanding of current market conditions.  The duplicate earnings data for October 2024 needs clarification.
