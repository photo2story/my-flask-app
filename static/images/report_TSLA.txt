2026-01-10 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Tesla (TSLA) based on the provided data:

**0) Data Overview:**

We are analyzing Tesla's stock performance, financial health, and recent news to assess its current standing. The analysis includes a comparison to the S&P 500 (VOO), technical indicators, analyst opinions, and earnings data.

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **TSLA:** Tesla Inc. is an electric vehicle and clean energy company.
*   **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 1026.20%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 92.74%
*   **Divergence:** 933.46
*   **Relative Divergence:** 65.5 (meaning the current divergence is in the lower range of its historical fluctuations).

**Analysis:** Tesla has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the tracked period, with a massive cumulative return difference. However, the relative divergence of 65.5 suggests that the outperformance, while substantial, is not at its historical peak relative to past fluctuations. The difference of cumulative return on the last day of the data shows +933.46, and relative divergence is in the lower range, we should be careful to see this number is biased.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|-------|---------|------|---------|
| 2016-2018  | 9.0%    | 30.5% | 5.0%    | 1.3  | 75.3   |
| 2017-2019  | 13.0%   | 40.0% | -4.0%   | 1.3  | 94.7   |
| 2018-2020  | 588.0%  | 40.0% | 568.0%  | 1.3  | 798.8  |
| 2019-2021  | 759.0%  | 29.9% | 715.0%  | 1.3  | 1196.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 258.0%  | 46.9% | 259.0%  | 1.5  | 418.3  |
| 2021-2023  | 201.0%  | 46.9% | 200.0%  | 1.9  | 843.9  |
| 2022-2024  | 573.0%  | 46.4% | 554.0%  | 2.0  | 1371.5 |
| 2023-2025  | 512.0%  | 57.1% | 450.0%  | 2.3  | 1527.3 |

*   **CAGR:** Demonstrates substantial growth, particularly in the 2018-2021 period.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown indicates the risk, with significant drawdowns in all periods.
*   **Alpha:** Generally high positive alpha indicates Tesla's performance exceeds what's predicted by its beta (market sensitivity).
*   **Beta:** A beta consistently above 1 indicates that Tesla's price is more volatile than the market.  The increasing Beta over time, especially in recent years, suggests higher volatility compared to the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 435.80
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 445.01, Previous Close: 435.80, Change: 2.11
*   **5-day SMA:** 437.15
*   **20-day SMA:** 461.94
*   **60-day SMA:** 443.68

**Analysis:** The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA being lower than the 20-day SMA further supports this. The slight rebound from the previous close doesn't negate the overall downward trend suggested by the moving averages.

**3) Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 37.22 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.36 (Below Zero - potential downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" (Indicates a buying opportunity based on the model's parameters, and it is very safe investment but the investment amount is too small (only 2 shares))
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -8.6 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 410.1% (Long-term)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. The RSI nearing oversold territory (below 30) could signal a potential buying opportunity, but should be confirmed with other indicators. The negative PPO supports the possibility of a downtrend. The negative change in relative divergence indicates recent underperformance. The model suggests a strong long-term upside (410.1% expected return) despite current short-term weaknesses.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Headlines:** Several articles highlight potential risks including:
    *   Berlin Gigafactory risks ("The Math Doesn’t Add Up Anymore")
    *   UBS maintains a "Sell" rating, citing AI optimism exceeding fundamentals.
    *   A bearish case questioning Tesla's growth.
    *   Truist cuts the price target due to Q4 delivery miss.

*   **Positive Headlines:** Some positive aspects are also present
    *   Tesla stock gains as Elon Musk explains Nvidia Buy.
    *   Record energy storage offsets Q4 delivery miss

**Analysis:** Recent news presents a mixed picture. While some headlines highlight potential challenges and bearish viewpoints, others point to positive developments like the Nvidia buy explanation. The overall tone leans negative, highlighting concerns about growth, valuation, and production issues. This news flow likely contributes to the recent stock price weakness.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (2.63)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 401.40 (below current price); High: 600.00; Low: 120.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No specific changes provided.

**Analysis:** The consensus rating is "Hold," indicating analysts are generally neutral on the stock. The average target price is below the current price, suggesting limited upside potential in the near term based on analyst estimates. The wide range between the high and low target prices reflects significant disagreement among analysts regarding Tesla's future prospects.
