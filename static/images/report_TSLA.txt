## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1133.42%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 130.06%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1003.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 58.2% indicates that TSLA's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this is a relative measure and should be interpreted cautiously. The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures shown in the provided data for the periods 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 are noteworthy, but the subsequent negative CAGR figures highlight significant volatility.  Alpha is consistently reported as 0.0, indicating that the company's performance is entirely explained by its beta (market sensitivity).  The increasing Beta values over time (with exception of the final 2 years) suggest increasing sensitivity to market fluctuations.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $345.16
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $341.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $318.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $264.99

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the last market price of $356.69 indicates a recent jump.  This should be considered in light of the provided delta_previous_relative_divergence.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.62 - Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions; the market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.63 - Indicates a bearish trend.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-) -  This signals a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 1107.5% - This exceptionally high figure suggests a highly optimistic long-term outlook (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500.  This should be treated with caution. The significant volatility demonstrated in the CAGR data highlights the substantial risks associated with this forecast.  The provided closing price of $345.16 vs. the last market price of $356.69 is a relatively small jump, and not indicative of rapid changes.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some fluctuation in both revenue and EPS.  Revenue reached a peak of $25.50B in Q2 2024, declining slightly to $25.18B in Q3 2024. EPS also fluctuated, reaching a high of $0.68 in Q3 2024. There is no clear consistent upward or downward trend observable in the given data alone.  Further analysis would be needed to assess the significance of these numbers compared to market expectations.  Note that there are duplicate entries for October 24th, 2024; this data needs clarification.

* **Revenue:**  Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally maintains a high level.

* **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE shows substantial variation, with a notable spike to 12.66% in Q4 2023 followed by a drop to 3.10% in Q3 2024.  Further information is needed to understand the drivers of this volatility.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, exhibiting high growth and volatility.  However, the recent negative CAGR figures indicate substantial risk.  Technical indicators show mixed signals. While the price is above its moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, other indicators hint at bearish sentiment. The high projected long-term expected return should be viewed with extreme caution due to the historical volatility. Recent earnings show some fluctuations, requiring more context to interpret properly.  A thorough analysis needs additional data, including comparison to market expectations, news regarding recent events (item 6), and detailed investigation into the inconsistencies and variations found in the ROE and profit margin data.
