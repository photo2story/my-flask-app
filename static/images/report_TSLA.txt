## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1297.76%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.07%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1175.7%, placing it at the 71.2nd percentile of the historical range of its outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance historically, though this is not a prediction of future performance. The provided Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market, though the Beta is highly variable, indicating sensitivity to market movements that varies considerably over time.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $424.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $394.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $353.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $285.73

The stock price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The significant difference between the closing price and the moving averages shows considerable momentum.  The last market price (422.32) is near the closing price, indicating a relatively stable day.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 79.93 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO:** 0.879 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +12.8% –  Points towards a short-term uptrend.

Given the high RSI and the large positive recent relative strength change, a period of consolidation or a pullback could be expected.   The expected return of 853.5% over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon compared to the S&P 500 is extremely high and should be viewed with significant caution. This is not a guaranteed prediction, and market conditions can significantly change.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the historical period shown.  However, recent technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction is possible given the overbought RSI. The company's financial performance shows some volatility in both revenue and profitability.  The substantial difference between the current price and moving averages indicates strong momentum. The high projected long-term return compared to the S&P 500 is extremely ambitious and requires further context and analysis. The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits a complete assessment of the current market sentiment towards Tesla.  Careful consideration of risk is essential before investing.  Further investigation into the duplicate entry in the earnings data is recommended.
