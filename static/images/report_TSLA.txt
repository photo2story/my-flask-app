## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA (1228.90%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (115.09%). The difference is 1113.8%, placing it at the 67.6th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided data).  The provided alpha values consistently show TSLA's outperformance relative to the benchmark, though Beta indicates a high degree of market correlation, particularly in certain periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $403.84
* **Last Market Price:** $380.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $433.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $418.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $326.56

The stock price is currently below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's significantly above its 60-day moving average, hinting at potential longer-term bullishness. The significant difference between the last market price and the closing price indicates a notable price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.57 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -2.03 (Negative; suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.9% (Short-term downward trend)

The relatively neutral RSI and negative PPO suggest a mixed short-term outlook. The negative divergence further reinforces the short-term bearish trend. The significant drop from the closing price to the last market price ($403.84 to $380.09) indicates a recent price decline, though not necessarily a "crash". A 408.8% expected return over the long-term (2+ years) versus the S&P 500  is exceptionally high and should be considered with caution given the inherent volatility of TSLA.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA shows exceptionally high cumulative returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent price action indicates short-term bearish pressure.  Financial statements reveal fluctuating revenue and profit margins, alongside considerable variability in ROE.  A thorough analysis requires clarifying duplicate entries in the earnings report, integrating missing news and analyst commentary, and further investigation into the reasons behind the large ROE swings.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return should be viewed with substantial skepticism, as it's likely overly optimistic given the stock's volatility.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
