2025-01-18 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Tesla Inc. (TSLA) based on the provided data, presented in a report format.

**1. Performance Review: TSLA vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return for TSLA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 1255.69 - 116.43 = 1139.26. This indicates a substantial outperformance.  The relative divergence of 69.1% places TSLA's performance in the upper percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR data shows highly volatile performance, with periods of exceptional growth alternating with significant declines. This volatility is reflected in the high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures.  While the Alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting slight outperformance relative to the market (Beta of ~0.1 indicates low correlation with the market), the sheer magnitude of swings requires careful consideration.  The negative CAGR for 2021-2024 underscores the risk associated with investing in TSLA.


**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **Closing Price:** $415.11
* **Last Market Price:** $432.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $407.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $420.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $355.62

The last market price ($432.87) is higher than the closing price, suggesting a recent price increase.  The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but significantly above the 60-day moving average. This could suggest a short-term upward trend, potentially a recovery after a period of decline.  However, further analysis is needed. The relatively large gap between the 60-day and the current price indicates a possible recent surge in the price.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI:** 37.76 – This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially signaling a bounce.
* **PPO:** -1.01 – A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.8 – This points to a short-term upward trend.

The positive relative divergence change, coupled with the relatively low RSI, presents a mixed signal.  The negative PPO suggests bearish momentum which contradicts the upward trend shown by the relative divergence and the price being above short-term moving averages.


The expected return of 387.5% over a long-term (2+ years) horizon, relative to the S&P 500, seems exceptionally high and should be treated with extreme caution.  Such projections are highly speculative and depend on numerous unpredictable factors.  The volatility illustrated in the CAGR data makes this projection highly uncertain. The high last market price compared to the closing price might hint at a recent significant positive event driving the price. This could be a short-term effect which shouldn't be taken into consideration when evaluating the long-term potential.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 2023-09-30  | $53.47      | 3.47    |

Equity has shown consistent growth.  ROE is highly volatile. The exceptionally high ROE in Q4 2023 requires further investigation to understand the underlying drivers.


**7. Overall Conclusion**

Tesla's performance shows extreme volatility, with periods of massive growth followed by significant declines. While the cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500, the high risk associated with this volatility cannot be ignored. Recent price action suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but technical indicators provide a mixed signal.  Earnings data shows some variability but generally points to continued revenue growth. The financial information highlights both growth in equity and fluctuating profitability.  Any investment decision should consider this inherent volatility and the need for thorough due diligence, including comparing the company's performance to industry peers and macroeconomic conditions.  The projected long-term return should be viewed as highly speculative and not relied upon for investment decisions.
