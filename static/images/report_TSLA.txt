## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Tesla Inc., an electric vehicle and clean energy company, exhibits exceptionally high cumulative returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO). However, this performance is accompanied by high volatility, as evidenced by substantial maximum drawdown (MDD) figures.  Recent price action shows a slight dip below key moving averages, and indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition. While long-term expected returns are significantly higher than the S&P 500, careful consideration of the inherent risk is crucial.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Tesla's cumulative return of 2325.23% vastly surpasses the S&P 500's 78.93% return. The substantial divergence of 2246.3 percentage points places Tesla at the 74.5th percentile of its historical relative divergence against the S&P 500.  While this indicates strong outperformance, the high volatility, as shown by the wide range of past relative divergences (max: 3037.1, min: -65.1), is noteworthy.
