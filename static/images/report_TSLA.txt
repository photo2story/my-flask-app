* **5-Day Moving Average:** $331.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $293.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $252.31

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The significant gap between the price and the 60-day moving average indicates a substantial recent price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 73.6 -  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.27 - Positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +24.72 -  Confirms a recent period of strong upward momentum.  This is consistent with the price being above its moving averages.
* **Expected Return:** 101.82% -  Suggests substantial potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 with a consistent investment strategy.  However, this should be treated with caution, as future performance is not guaranteed.
* **341.94 Last Market Price:**  Given the upward trend and the high RSI, a price of 341.94 doesn't signal an immediate sharp reversal (either up or down), but rather a continuation of the upward trend, albeit with a potential short term correction being plausible, given the RSI value.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data reveals some volatility in revenue and EPS. While revenue generally remains high, EPS fluctuates.  More context (e.g., analyst estimates) is needed to fully assess the recent performance.  The most recent EPS of 0.68 is higher than the previous quarters, potentially indicating a positive trend.  More data is needed on the "expected" EPS to make a complete assessment for the period 2024-10-24.

**5.  Quarterly Financial Data Analysis (Revenue and Profitability & Capital and Profitability):**

The revenue figures show some fluctuation but remain at a high level. Profit margins are relatively stable.  The Return on Equity (ROE) data shows some variance, with a significantly high ROE in 2023-12-31, potentially attributable to specific events that need further investigation.  Further analysis is needed to pinpoint the causes of fluctuations in both revenue and profitability metrics.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **(Missing Data):**  To provide comprehensive analysis in this section, please provide the requested news articles and analyst opinions from sources such as Shacknews and Finbold, within the last two days including recent market outlook and analyst performance highlights.

**7. Overall Summary:**

Tesla has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  However, recent performance has shown a downturn. While the short-term trend is positive based on moving averages and relative strength, the high RSI suggests potential for a price correction.  Long-term prospects look promising based on the expected return calculation, assuming consistent investment, but this is subject to market conditions and inherent uncertainty. The financial data reveals revenue stability but fluctuation in EPS and ROE, necessitating further scrutiny to identify underlying causes and to interpret the significance of the changes in context.  The lack of recent news data prevents a complete assessment of market sentiment and analyst perspectives.  A complete picture requires the missing news and analyst data.
