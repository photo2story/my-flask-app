## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1255.68%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1139.26%.  This places TSLA at the 69.1st percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided range.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows highly volatile CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures,  indicating a high-risk, high-reward investment. Alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance compared to the market benchmark after adjusting for risk (beta). Beta is consistently around 0.1, significantly lower than 1. This unusually low beta figure may warrant further investigation for its accuracy. The Cap (market capitalization in Billions) remains constant across all years,  which is unlikely and suggests an error in the data.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $415.11
* **Last Market Price:** $413.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $407.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $420.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $355.62

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The 5-day moving average being closer to the current price indicates some short-term stabilization.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.76 - This indicates that the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.01 - A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +3.8 -  A positive change indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

The provided `Last-market` price of $413.59 is not significantly different from the closing price, so there is no evidence of a sudden price jump or drop.

The expected return of 387.5% over the long term (2+ years) represents a substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this prediction needs to be considered cautiously given the high volatility indicated by the historical data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally remains relatively high, the EPS fluctuates.  There's also a duplication of data for October 24th, 2024, which needs clarification. A deeper dive into the reasons behind these fluctuations is needed before drawing strong conclusions.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.68 | 25.18        |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.46 | 25.50        |
| 2024-04-24 | 0.37 | 21.30        |

| 2024-10-24 | 0.58 | 23.35        | *(Duplicate Data)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals some inconsistencies that require further investigation.  Specifically, the significant drop in ROE from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 is concerning and warrants a deeper analysis of the underlying factors.  Also note the relatively low and fluctuating ROE compared to the high revenue.


| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | 25.18        | 19.84%        | 69.93       | 3.10    |
| 2024-06-30  | 25.50        | 17.95%        | 66.47       | 2.22    |
| 2024-03-31  | 21.30        | 17.35%        | 64.38       | 1.75    |
| 2023-12-31  | 25.17        | 17.63%        | 62.63       | 12.66   |
| 2023-09-30  | 23.35        | 17.89%        | 53.47       | 3.47    |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance shows high volatility and significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the past.  However, recent price action and some financial indicators suggest a potential downward trend. The provided data contains inconsistencies and requires further verification before drawing definitive conclusions. The unusually low beta values throughout the years needs additional investigation.  Before making any investment decision, a thorough review of the underlying factors impacting earnings, profit margins, and ROE is crucial, along with a verification of data accuracy. The high expected return should be treated with caution given the inherent risk associated with TSLA.
