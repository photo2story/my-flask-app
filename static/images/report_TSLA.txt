## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return for TSLA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 1104.7 percentage points.  While the relative divergence suggests TSLA's performance has been substantially above the S&P 500 historically (at the 67.1st percentile of its historical range),  it's crucial to understand that past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a small degree of outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  However, the beta values show significant volatility, ranging from 0.1 to 1296.0, indicating extreme sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The exceptionally high beta values in certain periods (2018-2021) highlight the high risk associated with TSLA investments.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $403.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $399.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $424.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $346.00

The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The proximity to the 5-day moving average suggests some short-term stabilization.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 41.67 - This indicates that TSLA is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound.  However, it's not a definitive buy signal.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.06 - This negative value confirms a bearish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.1 -  This confirms a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 412.3% - This is a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  This projection, however, requires caution.  Such high returns are highly speculative and depend on various unpredictable factors. The high volatility of TSLA makes such projections inherently unreliable.  The 403.31 price does not seem to indicate a sudden sharp uptrend or downtrend based solely on the provided information; more contextual data would be needed.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68  | $25.18B       |

| 2024-10-24 | $0.58  | $23.35B       |

There appears to be an error in the data, with duplicate entries for October 2024.  Ignoring the duplicate, revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains strong. EPS shows variability, suggesting potential volatility in profitability. More detailed analysis requires resolving the data inconsistency and reviewing trends over a longer time period.

| 2023-09-30  | $53.47B     | 3.47%         |

Equity has been increasing steadily. ROE is highly variable, with a significant spike in Q4 2023. This needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has demonstrated significant historical outperformance against the S&P 500. However, this has come with substantial volatility, as evidenced by the high beta values.  Current indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend, although the RSI indicates oversold conditions, potentially signaling a near-term rebound.  Long-term projections must be viewed with extreme caution due to inherent uncertainty and market volatility.  Fundamental analysis reveals relatively stable revenue and healthy profit margins, although profitability and ROE show inconsistencies that require deeper investigation.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence and consideration of individual risk tolerance are crucial.  The data inconsistencies need to be addressed before drawing strong conclusions.
