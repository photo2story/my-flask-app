## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1284.95%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.36%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1164.59%.  This places TSLA at the 70.5th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on a range of -53.2% to 1673.1%.  While this shows strong historical outperformance, it's crucial to remember past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and significant swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  The consistently low Beta (around 0.1) suggests relatively low correlation with the overall market.  However, the wildly fluctuating CAGR and the extremely high alpha values in certain periods highlight the risk associated with TSLA. The negative CAGRs in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 are especially noteworthy.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $424.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $417.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $416.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $362.49

The closing price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, indicating some short-term upward momentum.  However, it's significantly higher than the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price surge.  The negative change from the previous close (-$0.57) suggests a minor daily dip.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.87 (Slightly below neutral; not overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.45 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 3.4 (+), indicating short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 371.3%  (This represents a significant projected outperformance over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming a continuation of historical trends.  This projection is highly speculative given the inherent volatility of TSLA).

The small negative change from the previous close suggests minor sell-off, not a significant crash.  The conflicting signals from the RSI and PPO highlight the uncertainty surrounding the short-term direction of the stock.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS.  While revenue generally remained strong, EPS shows significant variability.  There appears to be a potential error in the data, with duplicate entries for October 24th, 2024.  A more consistent data set is needed for a more thorough analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability show some volatility. Revenue fluctuates around $25B but Profit Margins are relatively stable around 17-19%.  The Capital and Profitability data indicate volatility in Equity and ROE. This highlights a degree of inconsistency in profitability and financial stability.  The significantly higher ROE in 2023-12-31 (12.66%) compared to other quarters requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's historical performance against the S&P 500 has been exceptionally strong, but extremely volatile.  The high CAGR and alpha values during certain periods contrast sharply with significant drawdowns, indicating a high-risk, high-reward investment.  Recent price movements suggest potential short-term upward momentum, though technical indicators provide mixed signals.  Long-term prospects are highly speculative, based on the very high expected return, but carry significant risk.   Inconsistent earnings data and fluctuating profitability figures raise concerns about financial stability.  A more comprehensive analysis requires a closer examination of the company's financial statements, future growth projections, and an assessment of the market's overall sentiment towards Tesla and the EV sector.  Thorough due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions.
