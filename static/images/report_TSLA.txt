## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1316.95%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1199.4%, placing it at the 72.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's min/max range.  This indicates a substantial outperformance historically, although the recent -456% CAGR (2021-2023) shows significant volatility.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility in Tesla's performance, with extremely high CAGR in some periods (over 1000%) and significant negative CAGR in others.  The beta fluctuates wildly, reflecting Tesla's sensitivity to overall market movements, however, this significantly increases over time.  The consistently low alpha suggests that while significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over certain periods, a significant portion of that outperformance may not be attributable to factors unique to Tesla itself.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $430.60
* **Last Market Price:** $462.28 (Note: Discrepancy between closing and last market price needs clarification.  This might reflect after-hours trading or a different data source.)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $441.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $396.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $311.40

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but significantly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent upward trend. The difference between the last market price and the closing price indicates potential volatility or after-hours trading activity.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.84 – Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction.
* **PPO:** -0.64 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.0% – Shows a recent decline in relative strength.

The significant gap between the last market price ($462.28) and the closing price ($430.60) suggests a potential rapid price movement (either a sharp increase or decrease) in the short term.  The expected return of 857.5% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 represents a high growth expectation, but significant risk is implied given the past volatility.

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS.  While revenue generally remains high (above $20B), it doesn't show a consistent upward trend. EPS shows no clear trend either, with increases and decreases across consecutive quarters.  Further analysis is needed with expectations data to determine beats or misses.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has been exceptionally volatile, exhibiting periods of extremely high growth followed by significant declines.  While it has historically outperformed the S&P 500, this is not guaranteed to continue.  Technical indicators suggest potential short-term correction, and a high long-term expected return is suggested, but the risk is substantial.  Further analysis is needed to clarify the last market price and incorporate news, analyst opinions, and expectations data for a complete picture.  The high volatility makes predicting future performance challenging.
