2024-11-20 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1110.48%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 124.78%.  The difference is 985.7%, placing it at the 57.2nd percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (max: 1763.87%, min: -54.48%).  This indicates that while TSLA has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, its current outperformance is within the middle range of its historical performance relative to the index.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high growth potential with considerable volatility. Alpha consistently exceeds 1, suggesting outperformance relative to the market, but Beta, while generally above 1, is volatile, indicating sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The significant increase in market capitalization reflects substantial growth but also shows periods of consolidation or decline. The negative CAGR in the last two years indicates recent underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $338.74 (Last Market: $344.54)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $325.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $281.00
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $247.88

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates a recent period of consolidation or minor price correction.  The significant gap between the closing price and the 60-day moving average underscores a recent strong price increase from a lower price level.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (70.45):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (1.69):** Positive and above zero, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+23.21):** Shows a recent upward trend in relative strength.

The last market price ($344.54) exceeding the closing price ($338.74) points to a slight, recent price dip. Given the RSI value near overbought territory, this slight dip may be the beginning of a correction, although the PPO and 20-day relative divergence suggest positive momentum still persists.  The information does not directly mention a sharp upward or downward trend.

The Expected Return of 101.42% represents a projected significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows fluctuating revenue, with a peak in Q2 2024. EPS has also been inconsistent, but the latest earnings per share (EPS) of $0.68 exceeded expectations, indicating strong financial health.  There is a discrepancy in the data with two entries for October 24th, 2024, which needs clarification.  More detailed information is required to accurately assess the financial outlook.

**5. Financial Information Analysis (Revenue and Profitability, Capital and Profitability):**

The revenue shows some volatility but remains generally high. Profit margins are consistently healthy (17-20%).  ROE is inconsistent and shows significant fluctuation and is high in Q4 2023 but significantly lower in the following quarters.   More context is needed to properly assess the financial health of Tesla.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary of 1-6):**

Tesla shows a strong long-term historical outperformance against the S&P 500, reflected by its high cumulative returns and consistent positive alpha. However, recent performance has been inconsistent, with volatile price movements and some signs of a potential short-term correction. While the company shows strong revenue and profit margin, ROE volatility and a need for clarification on conflicting data points require a more in-depth financial review. Recent news and analyst opinions are needed for a complete evaluation of the current market sentiment and potential future performance.  A long-term investment horizon may still be favorable given the potential long-term growth outlook, but careful consideration of the recent volatility and potential short-term correction is warranted.
