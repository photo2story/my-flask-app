## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return for TSLA is 1292.88%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1174.5%, placing it at the 71.1 percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 (based on a historical range of -53.2% to 1673.1%).  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the broader market, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures for TSLA across different time periods.  The consistently low Beta (~0.1) suggests relatively low correlation with the overall market, indicating that TSLA's price movements are less influenced by broader market trends than typical stocks.  However, the extremely high CAGR figures in certain periods are likely unsustainable. The negative CAGR in recent periods (-347% and -449%) highlight the substantial risk associated with investing in TSLA.  The high Alpha values in some periods signal outperformance relative to the market, but again, the volatility needs to be considered.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.04 – Suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory but not yet there.
* **PPO:** -0.66 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.6 – Suggests short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 365.2% – This represents a significantly higher expected return than the S&P 500, but this projection should be treated with caution.  It's crucial to remember that this is a long-term projection and highly speculative, based on historical performance and current market conditions which can and likely will change.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  Revenue has remained relatively stable around $25B, with a slight dip in Q1 2024.  EPS shows some fluctuation but generally indicates profitability. More data is needed for a more comprehensive analysis.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.68 | $25.18B       |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.46 | $25.50B       |
| 2024-04-24 | 0.37 | $21.30B       |
| 2023-10-23 | 0.58 | $23.35B       |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.58 | $23.35B       | *(Note: Duplicate entry. Potential data entry error.)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively stable, although there's a decrease in Q1 2024. Profit margins are relatively consistent, hovering around 17-19%. Equity has shown growth, but ROE is quite volatile and not consistently high.  The significant drop in ROE from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 and then some recovery needs further investigation.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B    | 19.84%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B    | 17.95%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B    | 17.35%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B    | 17.63%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $23.35B    | 17.89%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE     |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B    | 3.10%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B    | 2.22%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38B    | 1.75%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B    | 12.66%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $53.47B    | 3.47%   |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock performance has shown exceptional growth in certain periods, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this growth has been characterized by extreme volatility, as evidenced by significant drawdowns and highly variable CAGRs. The low beta suggests relative market independence, but this also implies substantial risk. Recent price action suggests a short-term upward trend, but technical indicators hint at potential overbought conditions.  Earnings data show some consistency in revenue but some fluctuation in EPS. Financial data shows relatively stable revenue and profit margins but highly volatile ROE. The projected long-term expected return is extremely high but highly uncertain due to the company's inherent volatility.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high rewards against the significant risk involved.  Further investigation into the causes of the fluctuations in ROE and the reasons behind recent negative CAGRs is needed before making any investment decisions.
