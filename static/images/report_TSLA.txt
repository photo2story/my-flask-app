2024-12-12 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1219.53%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.40%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1099.12%, placing it at the 66.7th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (max: 1673.3, min: -53.1).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values for TSLA, particularly between 2018 and 2021. However,  the significant negative CAGR from 2021 to 2024 demonstrates substantial volatility.  The consistently low Beta values suggest relatively low correlation with the overall market, although the market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates significantly. The consistently low alpha values indicate that the stock's performance, while volatile, hasn't consistently exceeded the market's overall performance by a significant margin after accounting for risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $400.99 (Last Market: $418.95)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $381.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $349.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $282.45

The closing price is below the last market price, indicating a recent decline.  The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting potential upward momentum, although this is partially influenced by the recent price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 73.22 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.45 – A positive value suggests upward momentum, although the magnitude is relatively small.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +9.4 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

The last market price of $418.95 is higher than the closing price, suggesting a recent short-term decline or correction after a period of relative strength.  No information is present to indicate a sudden drop or jump in price.

The expected return of 908.5% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a very high figure and should be considered cautiously.  This is likely a projection based on historical data, and future performance is not guaranteed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates around $25B, with a slight decrease in Q1 2024.  There's no clear consistent upward trend.
* **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS shows some fluctuation, peaking at $0.68 in Q4 2024, followed by a decline.  There is no clear consistent upward trend.
* **Comparison:** Comparing quarters, we see no consistent pattern in either revenue or EPS.  No information about beats or misses versus expectations is available.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable around $25B, while profit margins show some fluctuation, but generally hover around 17-20%.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown growth, but ROE (Return on Equity) is highly volatile, experiencing significant fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.  The extremely high ROE in Q4 2023 is a notable outlier.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Market outlook information is also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500. However, recent performance shows considerable volatility.  While the stock exhibits strong long-term growth potential based on its historical data (reflected in the very high expected return figure), it also carries substantial risk as evidenced by the sharp fluctuations in its CAGR, RSI, ROE, and EPS.  The recent price action suggests a potential correction after a period of relative strength.  More information, specifically recent news, analyst opinions, and details on earnings expectations, is necessary for a complete and up-to-date analysis. The projected 908.5% long-term return should be treated as highly speculative.
