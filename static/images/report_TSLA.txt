## Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Review

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return (1178.51%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (85.44%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 1093.1%, placing it at the 67.2nd percentile of the historical divergence range (max: 1648.6, min: -44.5). This indicates Tesla's substantial outperformance relative to the broader market, although the relative divergence is not at its historical peak.

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and significant outperformance in several periods, particularly between 2018 and 2021. However, the period 2021-2023 shows a substantial negative CAGR, highlighting the risk associated with Tesla's high growth.  The rising Beta value over time indicates increasing market sensitivity.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $267.28
* **5-day Moving Average:** $268.24
* **20-day Moving Average:** $254.56
* **60-day Moving Average:** $326.89

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price drop of $5.47 (from $282.76) indicates a short-term decline.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.49 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 2.23 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.9% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return:** 467.4% (Long-term, over 2 years, exceeding the S&P 500).  This high expected return reflects the inherent risk associated with Tesla's volatility.  The recent price drop of $5.47 might be factored in this expected return, indicating a possible pullback from potentially overvalued prices.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show some inconsistencies, with duplicate entries for 2025-01-30 and variations in revenue figures for seemingly similar quarters.  More consistent and complete data is needed for a thorough analysis.  The data does suggest flat EPS between October 2024 and January 2025 and an overall fluctuation in revenue.  Further analysis requires a more comprehensive dataset.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.68 | 25.18         |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.46 | 25.50         |
| 2024-04-24 | 0.37 | 21.30         |


**5) Financial Information:**

The financial information shows some fluctuation in revenue and profitability, with profit margin ranging from 16.26% to 19.84% in the latest quarters.  Equity has shown steady growth, but ROE is highly volatile, showing a significant drop in the 2024-03-31 quarter. This warrants further investigation into potential factors driving these changes.


| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31  | 25.71         | 16.26%        | 72.91        | 3.23    |
| 2024-09-30  | 25.18         | 19.84%        | 69.93        | 3.10    |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's historical performance shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with considerable volatility. Recent price action suggests a bearish trend, supported by the price being below its moving averages. While technical indicators present a mixed picture, the high expected return reflects the potential for long-term growth, but also highlights the significant risk involved.  Inconsistent earnings data and fluctuating financial metrics necessitate a more thorough review with complete and consistent data.  Investors should carefully consider Tesla's high volatility and the risks associated with its high growth potential before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the causes of the volatility in ROE and the discrepancies in the earnings data is essential for a complete assessment.
