## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 1046.1% for TSLA versus 123.86% for VOO.  The difference in cumulative returns is 922.24%, placing it at the 53.71st percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500 (based on a min/max range of -54.48% to 1763.87%). This indicates a substantial outperformance historically but its recent relative performance has declined.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data further emphasizes this significant outperformance, particularly during 2018-2021.  However, the most recent periods (2021-2023 and 2022-2024) show a dramatic slowdown and even negative returns, highlighting the volatility inherent in TSLA's performance. The high alpha values consistently above 1 suggest TSLA has historically generated returns exceeding those explained by market movements alone.  The beta values generally above 1 indicate higher volatility than the market.

* **Closing Price:** $320.72 (Last Market: $320.83)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $328.13

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $245.91

The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the moving averages indicates a recent price drop.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 66.29 – This suggests the stock is not overbought (above 70), but is approaching potentially overbought territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.81 – A positive PPO indicates upward momentum, but its magnitude requires further context within the broader market conditions.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +19.37 –  Indicates a recent short-term upward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 101.23% – This represents a substantial potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500, if the current price holds and future market conditions remain favorable.  However, this is a projected figure and actual returns can vary significantly.  The $320.83 price is not substantially above the moving averages to suggest extreme rapid price changes.

Further analysis of the reported figures vs. analyst expectations is needed to thoroughly evaluate the results.  The inclusion of duplicate data points (2024-10-24) suggests an error in the provided dataset.
