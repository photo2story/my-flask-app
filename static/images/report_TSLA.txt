* Closing Price: $267.28
* 5-Day Moving Average: $268.24
* 20-Day Moving Average: $254.56
* 60-Day Moving Average: $326.89

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The significant daily price change (-5.47) indicates a recent sharp decline.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's historical performance shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, marked by high CAGR and Alpha in several periods.  However, recent performance reveals considerable volatility and a period of significant underperformance. The current price is below key moving averages, signaling a potential downtrend. While some technical indicators suggest bullish momentum, the recent sharp price decline and negative divergence warrant caution.  The high expected long-term return should be viewed with prudence considering the recent volatility and the inherent uncertainty of future market performance.  A thorough investigation into the factors driving the recent decline in ROE and the inconsistencies in EPS is necessary for a comprehensive assessment.  Further analysis of macroeconomic factors and company-specific news is needed for a more informed investment decision.
