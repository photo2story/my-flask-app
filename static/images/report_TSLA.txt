* **Closing Price:** $379.28
* **5-day Moving Average:** $417.26
* **20-day Moving Average:** $420.30
* **60-day Moving Average:** $328.87

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.95 – This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce, however it’s not enough on its own to signal a reversal.
* **PPO:** -2.70 – A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Divergence (20-day):** -15.9% – This further confirms the negative short-term momentum.

Given that the current price ($379.28) is significantly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, the price action suggests a recent downward trend.  The provided Expected Return of 476.8% over a long-term (2+ years) is a high-growth forecast that needs to be considered with caution due to the inherent volatility of Tesla's price and high sensitivity to market conditions and news events.  The expected return should be viewed as a potential upside rather than a guaranteed outcome.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly results show a slight decrease in revenue from $25.50B to $25.18B.  EPS also decreased from $0.46 to $0.37 between Q2 and Q3, before increasing to $0.68 in Q4. The revenue growth trend is inconsistent, while EPS shows some volatility. There is no information provided to determine if these numbers beat or missed expectations.  Further data is needed for thorough analysis.  Note the repetition of data for Oct 24, 2024.  The source data seems to contain some errors and should be reviewed for accuracy.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates over the quarters, showing no consistent upward trend in the presented data.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margin fluctuated between 17.35% and 19.84% in the reported period.
* **Equity and ROE:** Equity has shown a general upward trend, while the return on equity (ROE) is highly volatile, showcasing significant swings in profitability.
