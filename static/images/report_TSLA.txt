| Year | CAGR | MDD | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2016-2018 | 9.0% | 30.5% | 5.0% | 1.3 | 73.8 |

| 2019-2021 | 759.0% | 29.9% | 715.0% | 1.3 | 1171.5 |
| 2020-2022 | 258.0% | 46.9% | 259.0% | 1.5 | 409.7 |
| 2021-2023 | 201.0% | 46.9% | 200.0% | 1.9 | 826.4 |
| 2022-2024 | 573.0% | 46.4% | 554.0% | 2.0 | 1343.1 |
| 2023-2025 | 512.0% | 57.1% | 450.0% | 2.3 | 1495.7 |

**Analysis:**
1.  **Explosive Growth & Alpha:** The period between 2018 and 2025 shows phenomenal annualized returns (CAGR), peaking at 759% (2019-2021). The Alpha figures (e.g., 715.0%, 554.0%) confirm that these returns were overwhelmingly generated by company-specific performance (not just market exposure).
2.  **Rising Volatility (Beta):** The Beta coefficient has seen a clear upward trend, rising from 1.3 (2016-2021) to 2.3 (2023-2025). This indicates that TSLA has become increasingly sensitive to general market movements, making it highly volatile and riskier relative to the overall market.
3.  **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** High downside risk is inherent, with MDD reaching 46.4% to 57.1% in the most recent periods, underscoring the necessity for high risk tolerance when investing.
4.  **Market Cap Growth:** The Market Cap data reflects the explosive growth trajectory, surging from below $100B pre-2020 to nearly $1.5 Trillion in the latest period.

### 2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Close Price** | **445.01** |
| Previous Close | 435.80 |
| Change | +2.11 (+4.85%) |
| 5-day SMA | 438.54 |
| 20-day SMA | 461.61 |
| 60-day SMA | 443.94 |

**Simple Analysis:**
The current price ($445.01) recently experienced a significant single-day rebound (+4.85%).
Technically, the stock is showing short-term strength as it is trading above its very short-term (5-day SMA) and medium-term support (60-day SMA). However, it remains below the 20-day SMA ($461.61), indicating that the short-term trend is still bearish, and a confirmed momentum shift requires a break above the 20-day average.

### 3) Indicator Analysis

| Indicator | Value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Market Risk Indicator (MRI)** | **0.7** | Low Investment Recommended (Cautionary signal). |
| **RSI (14-Day)** | **33.49** | Near the oversold threshold (<30), suggesting recent selling pressure. |
| **PPO (12, 26)** | **-1.1126** | Negative value confirms bearish momentum (short-term moving average is below the long-term). |
| **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days)** | **+1.0** | Short-term rise (단기상승). |
| **Expected Return (%)** | **398.6%** | High expected excess return over S&P 500 long-term. |

**Hybrid Signal:** *cash\_0%* / **Buy 100% of cash** (Very Safe - MRI:0.90)

**Analysis:**
The indicators present a mixed picture:
1.  **Momentum Pressure:** Both the RSI (33.49) and PPO (-1.1126) confirm that the stock has recently been under significant selling pressure, though the RSI is now close to levels where a technical rebound might occur.
2.  **Risk Assessment:** The MRI of 0.7 suggests caution (Low Investment), contradicting the internal Hybrid Signal, which calls for a 100% cash allocation to buy (Very Safe, MRI 0.90). This conflict highlights model disagreement on immediate tactical safety.
3.  **Positive Outlook:** The recent positive change in relative divergence (+1.0) and the massive Expected Return (398.6%) confirm the stock's long-term growth potential and current rebound attempt.

### 4) Recent News & Significant Events

Recent news suggests strong technical price action but underlying fundamental concerns:

| Date | Headline Summary | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2026-01-08/09 | Stock gained, providing a break for investors; but fundamental issues remain (Berlin Gigafactory risk, "Math Doesn’t Add Up"). | Barron's, TipRanks |
| 2026-01-07/10 | Mixed analyst views: GLJ Research maintains a Sell rating despite raising the price target to $25.28 (highly bearish valuation). Other reports note the recent gains. | Investing.com, Yahoo Finance |

**Analyst Opinions:**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Consensus | **Hold** (2.63 on 1-5 scale) |
| Target Price (Mean) | **$403.32** |
| Current Price | **$445.01** |
| Target Range | $120.00 (Low) / $600.00 (High) |
| Opinions Count | 41 |

**Analysis:**
The average analyst target price ($403.32) is **8.9% below** the current market price ($445.01). This indicates that Wall Street, on average, views the stock as overvalued at its current level. The "Hold" consensus and the extremely wide target range ($120 to $600) reflect deep division regarding TSLA's future valuation and growth trajectory, often seen with highly disruptive technology stocks.

### 5) Recent Earnings Analysis

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-10-23 | 0.43 | $28.09 B |
| 2025-07-24 | 0.36 | $22.50 B |
| 2025-04-23 | 0.13 | $19.34 B |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.68 | $25.18 B |
| 2025-01-30 | 0.68 | $25.18 B |

**Analysis:**
Tesla demonstrated significant revenue and profitability volatility during this period. Revenue hit a recent low in Q1 2025 ($19.34B) but showed a strong recovery throughout 2025, culminating in Q3 revenue of $28.09B. Earnings per Share (EPS) followed a similar sequential recovery in 2025 (from $0.13 to $0.43), although the Q3 2025 EPS ($0.43) remains significantly lower than the late 2024/early 2025 figures ($0.68). This suggests that while production and sales volumes are recovering strongly, pricing power or cost structures may still be under pressure compared to the previous year.

### 6) Financial Information

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-09-30 | $28.09B | 17.99% |
| 2025-06-30 | $22.50B | 17.24% |
| 2025-03-31 | $19.34B | 16.31% |
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B | 16.26% |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B | 19.84% |

**Capital and Profitability (ROE):**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-09-30 | $79.97B | 1.72% |
| 2025-06-30 | $77.31B | 1.52% |
| 2025-03-31 | $74.65B | 0.55% |
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B | 3.17% |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B | 3.11% |

**Analysis:**
1.  **Revenue & Margin Improvement:** Revenue showed robust growth over 2025, and crucially, the Profit Margin has sequentially improved, rising from a low of 16.26% (Q4 2024) to 17.99% (Q3 2025). This suggests successful efforts in controlling costs or stabilizing pricing after earlier volatility.
2.  **Weak Capital Efficiency:** While Total Equity continues to grow robustly, providing a strong balance sheet foundation (nearly $80B), the Return on Equity (ROE) remains exceptionally weak and inconsistent. ROE fell sharply in Q1 2025 (0.55%) and, despite recovering to 1.72% by Q3 2025, this figure is very low for a company valued based on high growth. This indicates poor efficiency in generating profits relative to the capital invested by shareholders, echoing the skepticism seen in some analyst reports.

### 7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)

TSLA remains an extreme outlier in terms of market performance, delivering a cumulative return of over 1000% against the S&P 500's 94%. This massive alpha generation comes with extreme systemic risk, indicated by a soaring Beta (up to 2.3) and high maximum drawdown (over 57%).

**Technical and Momentum:** The stock is showing signs of a strong short-term rebound (+4.85% recent change, positive relative divergence change), trading above its 5-day and 60-day moving averages. However, it still needs to break above the 20-day SMA ($461.61) to confirm a reversal of the recent bearish trend. RSI suggests the stock was recently oversold.

**Fundamentals and Risk:** TSLA has successfully demonstrated a sequential recovery in both revenue and profit margins throughout 2025, proving its capacity for expansion. However, concerns regarding fundamental efficiency are evident: the ROE is highly volatile and significantly weak (Q3 2025 ROE: 1.72%). The Market Risk Indicator (MRI 0.7) and the fact that the average analyst target price ($403.32) is below the current market price ($445.01) suggest market participants are pricing in risk and skepticism about current valuation levels.

**Conclusion:** TSLA presents a **high-risk, high-reward** opportunity. While the long-term expected excess return is immense (398.6%), the technical indicators point to a recent recovery within a structurally volatile environment. Investors must weigh the improving revenue and margin trajectory against weak current capital efficiency (low ROE) and the prevailing skepticism among analysts regarding its current stock price.
