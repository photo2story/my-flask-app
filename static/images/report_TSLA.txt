**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| 2024-2026  | 1180.0%   | 86.0% | 1074.0%  | -0.0 | 1503.8  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** An extremely high CAGR of 1180.0% indicates very strong average annual growth over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** An MDD of 86.0% suggests significant potential downside risk. Investors should be aware of the possibility of large losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** A very high Alpha of 1074.0% signifies that Tesla has substantially outperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. It implies that Tesla's returns are not solely due to market movements.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of -0.0 suggests Tesla's price is virtually uncorrelated with the S&P 500. This would indicate a high degree of independence of price action.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** The market capitalization is reported as 1503.8 Billion Dollars.

    *   The PPO is slightly negative, suggesting short-term underperformance.
    *   The Hybrid Signal recommends aggressive buying.
    *   The recent decline in relative divergence indicates short-term weakness in Tesla's performance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   The extremely high expected return suggests strong long-term potential (compared to the S&P 500).
    *   The significant price change in "Last Market Data" could be reflecting recent market volatility, so this should be monitored.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Headlines:** The news feed presents a mixed picture.
    *   Positive: Michael Burry is not shorting Tesla. This can reassure investors that a well-known short-seller doesn't see immediate downside.
    *   Negative: Cathie Wood (ARK Invest) is selling Tesla stock.  A large sale by a prominent investor can sometimes put downward pressure on the stock. A supplier slashing a large battery deal is also negative news, potentially impacting Tesla's future battery supply or production plans. Reports of a China ban are clearly negative, potentially impacting a significant market.
    *   Uncertain: Articles about upcoming deadlines and valuation analysis are more neutral, but should be considered in light of the overall picture.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.63 (~Hold)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 399.15 / 600.00 / 120.00

*   **Analysis:** Analyst consensus is a "Hold."  The average target price ($399.15) is below the current price, suggesting analysts, on average, believe the stock is currently overvalued. The wide range between the high and low target prices ($600 to $120) indicates a high degree of uncertainty and disagreement among analysts regarding Tesla's future prospects.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-10-23 | 0.43   | 28.09 B$   |

*   **Analysis:**  Revenue and EPS (Earnings Per Share) have fluctuated.  While the most recent quarter (2025-10-23) shows the highest revenue, the EPS is lower than previous quarters. A downward trend in EPS relative to revenue could indicate rising costs or declining profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Strong Performance, High Risk:** Tesla has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. Its high CAGR and Alpha confirm its strong financial performance, but the very high MDD suggests considerable downside risk, and the analyst community provides a "Hold" consensus with an average price target well below the current price.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators are mixed. The MRI suggests investment, while the recent relative divergence change indicates a short-term decline compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Conflicting News:** Recent news events are a mixed bag, with some positive and some negative developments.
*   **Earnings and Profitability Concerns:**  While revenue is growing, declining EPS and ROE raise questions about profitability.
*   **Valuation Concerns:** Analysts largely rate the stock as a "Hold" and the average price target is significantly below the current price.
*   **Overall:** Tesla presents a high-risk, high-reward investment. The company has demonstrated substantial growth and innovation, but significant risks remain related to valuation, competition, execution, and market volatility. Investors should carefully weigh these factors before making any investment decisions.
