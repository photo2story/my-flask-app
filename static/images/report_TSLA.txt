2025-03-24 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**0) Overview:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  

**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return (1152.64) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (104.98). The difference is 1047.7, placing it at the 63.9th percentile of its historical range (max: 1670.3, min: -54.1).  This indicates Tesla's performance has been substantially higher than the S&P 500 over the period considered.


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals significant volatility and outperformance in certain periods.  High Alpha values (especially in 2018-2021) suggest superior returns relative to the market benchmark.  However, the negative CAGR (-454%) between 2021-2023 highlights substantial risk and the importance of considering broader market trends when assessing performance. The large swings in CAGR and Alpha demonstrate a high degree of risk and reward inherent in TSLA.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) also shows significant growth over the years.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $248.71
* **5-day Moving Average:** $236.83
* **20-day Moving Average:** $261.83
* **60-day Moving Average:** $349.35

The price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend.  The recent price increase of $5.27 (from $236.26) suggests a possible short-term upward correction, but further analysis is required to confirm.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4247 (Medium Risk)  This suggests moderate risk, indicating caution is warranted.

* **RSI:** 39.26  Below 40, indicating the stock is potentially oversold.

* **PPO:** 0.3585 Positive value, but needs further context (e.g., historical PPO levels) for meaningful interpretation.

* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term decline).

* **Expected Return:** 437.3% (2+ years). This suggests significant potential outperformance of the S&P 500 in a long-term investment scenario. The recent price increase of $5.27 does not significantly alter this long-term outlook.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue          |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18 Billion  |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18 Billion  |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46 | $25.50 Billion  |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.46 | $25.50 Billion  |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30 Billion  |

The data shows some inconsistency and potential duplication in the provided earnings data (Jan 30th entries appear twice).  A more complete and consistent dataset is needed for a robust analysis. Revenue is relatively stable, while EPS fluctuates.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71 Billion | 16.26%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18 Billion | 19.84%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50 Billion | 17.95%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30 Billion | 17.35%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17 Billion | 17.63%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity        | ROE      |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91 Billion | 3.23%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93 Billion | 3.10%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47 Billion | 2.22%    |

| 2023-12-31 | $62.63 Billion | 12.66%   |

Revenue remains relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently healthy, though there is variation between quarters.  Equity is growing, but ROE is inconsistent, warranting further investigation into the underlying causes for the large difference between Q4 2023 and subsequent quarters.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, as evidenced by the high cumulative return.  However, this outperformance comes with substantial risk, as highlighted by the highly volatile CAGR and significant price swings. Recent price action suggests a possible short-term correction, with the stock trading below its moving averages.  While long-term projections show high potential for outperformance, investors should carefully consider the high-risk profile.  The inconsistent earnings data and the unusual ROE fluctuation require further investigation for a complete assessment.  The MRI indicates moderate risk, reinforcing the need for a cautious approach.  More consistent and comprehensive data are needed for a complete and accurate analysis.
