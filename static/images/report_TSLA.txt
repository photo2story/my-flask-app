2024-11-19 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return for TSLA is 1110.48%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 124.78%.  The difference is 985.7%, placing it at the 57.2nd percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided max/min range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently high Alpha values (exceeding 1.0), indicating Tesla has historically outperformed the market.  The Beta values, generally around 1.3-1.9, suggest higher volatility than the market.  Note the significant drop in CAGR and a negative value in the most recent period (2022-2024).  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values in recent years highlight the risk associated with Tesla's investment.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects its growth trajectory, although it has fluctuated.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $338.74 (Last-market: $338.87)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $325.87
* **20-day Moving Average:** $281.00
* **60-day Moving Average:** $247.88

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates that the recent upward momentum might be slowing down.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 70.45 – Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.69 – Positive value indicates upward momentum, but the level isn't extremely high.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +23.21 – Shows recent strong upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 101.42% – This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment.  This is a very optimistic projection and should be viewed with caution.

The price of $338.87 doesn't inherently indicate a sharp reversal.  However, given the RSI nearing overbought territory, a short-term correction is possible.


**4. Recent Financials & Outlook:**

The provided quarterly revenue shows some fluctuations, but generally maintains a high level.  EPS is also variable. The most recent quarter (2024-10-24) shows a higher EPS than expected, along with strong revenue figures.  Further analysis is needed to assess the sustainability of these numbers and potential factors contributing to the variability.  We lack the expected EPS for 2024-10-24 for proper comparison.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is consistently high, but profit margins show some fluctuation, though generally remaining above 17%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been increasing, though ROE (Return on Equity) has experienced volatility.  The significant jump in ROE in 2023-12-31 requires further investigation to understand the contributing factors.


**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD.

Analyst opinions and performance highlights from these sources will offer insights into the short-term and long-term market outlook.


**8. Summary:**

Tesla's stock has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high growth and substantial volatility.  While recent financial results are strong, the stock price shows signs of potential short-term correction due to overbought conditions indicated by RSI.  The high expected long-term return is a very optimistic prediction and subject to various market forces and company performance.   A comprehensive analysis requires incorporating recent news, analyst opinions, and a deeper dive into the financial statements to understand the driving forces behind the fluctuations in profit margins and ROE.  The high volatility of the stock warrants a careful risk assessment before investment.
