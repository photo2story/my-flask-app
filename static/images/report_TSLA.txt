## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Tesla Inc., an American electric vehicle and clean energy company, exhibits significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  However, recent price action suggests a potential slowdown, warranting careful consideration.  High growth potential is indicated, but considerable risk is also present, as shown by volatility metrics.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla's cumulative return of 2340.41% drastically outperforms the S&P 500's 66.36% return. The relative divergence of 75% suggests Tesla's performance is currently positioned in the higher range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows considerable variation year-to-year, indicating high volatility and market sensitivity. While  Alpha (excess return compared to the market) generally shows positive values in recent years, particularly noticeable spikes in 2018-2021 and 2022-2024, suggesting periods of significant outperformance,  Beta (market sensitivity) remains relatively stable, suggesting the stock's price is somewhat sensitive to overall market movements. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates significantly, reflecting Tesla's dynamic growth trajectory.  Note the exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in recent years.


**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $252.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $246.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $255.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $311.22

The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish short-term trend.  The recent small price drop of -$0.04 does not indicate a significant event.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.33 (Approaching oversold territory but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.68 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 615.5% (Significant outperformance compared to S&P 500 expected over the long term)

The MRI suggests a high-risk profile.  While the RSI is approaching oversold conditions, it's not decisively in that zone. The positive PPO and upward relative divergence support the bullish momentum.  The high expected return highlights Tesla's long-term growth potential.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock demonstrates remarkable historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, the recent price action and high-risk indicators suggest caution. The high expected return over the long term is promising, but the volatility and the current price position below moving averages indicate a potential short-term correction.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in earnings data and a more detailed financial statement analysis are necessary to provide a more comprehensive assessment of Tesla's current financial health and future prospects.  The provided data suggests high growth potential with considerable risk.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential rewards against the significant volatility.
