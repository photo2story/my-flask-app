## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA (1210.98%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (130.81%). The difference is 1080.17%, placing it at the 62.4th percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 across all periods suggest that TSLA's performance is not significantly attributed to factors outside the market movements reflected in the Beta. The high Beta suggests high volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $369.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $356.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $338.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $274.23

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.95 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** -0.356 (Slightly negative, indicating potential weakening momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-), suggesting recent short-term downward pressure.  The closing price of $369.49 might reflect a recent rebound, but the data doesn't suggest a dramatic jump (no mention of a sharp price movement).
* **Expected Return:** 1042.5% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500.  This highlights the significant potential for outsized returns, but this is a projection and not a guaranteed outcome.  The high volatility inherent in TSLA should be considered.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided within the given data.  Information on recent market outlook and analyst opinions is absent.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, as indicated by the vastly higher cumulative returns. However, recent technical indicators (RSI) suggest the stock might be approaching overbought territory, and the PPO shows slightly weakening momentum. Earnings data reveals fluctuations in both revenue and EPS, without clear consistent upward trends. The considerable difference between the highest and lowest ROE values signals significant shifts in profitability. The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive analysis.  The high long-term expected return must be considered in light of the inherent volatility of the stock and the absence of supporting context such as current market conditions or future expectations.
