## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return for TSLA is 1159.86%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 127.58%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1032.28%.  The relative divergence of 59.77% indicates that TSLA's performance is in the upper 59.77th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The high alpha values across different periods suggest significant outperformance compared to the market benchmark, while the relatively stable beta (around 1.3-1.9) indicates a correlation with the broader market. However, note the recent negative CAGR (-11.8%) and significant MDD indicating increased risk.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $343.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $301.95
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $256.98

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  However, the relatively large gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicates some volatility. The last market price of $355.61 being slightly higher than the closing price suggests a minor upward correction.

**4. Recent Financials and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS, but overall positive growth in the last 2 years.  The October 2024 EPS of $0.68 is higher than previous quarters, but requires comparison with analyst expectations and future predictions.  Revenue also seems to have plateaued recently despite fluctuating between $21 billion and $25 billion per quarter. Further analysis is needed regarding the October 2024 EPS figure to determine if it exceeded or missed expectations.

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remained relatively stable at around $25 billion for the last several quarters. Profit margins have fluctuated between 17% and 20%, suggesting some variability in profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown overall growth, but ROE has fluctuated significantly, with a notably high ROE in Q4 2023 and lower returns in subsequent quarters.  This inconsistency warrants further investigation.
