Tesla's cumulative return (2201.72%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (76.31%).  The divergence between TSLA and VOO is substantial, currently at 2125.4%, placing it at the 70.6th percentile of its historical range (max: 3037.1%, min: -65.1%).  This indicates TSLA's performance has been exceptionally strong compared to the broader market, but also highlights the significant volatility involved.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for TSLA over several years, ranging from 29% to an astonishing 1751%.  The high CAGR is accompanied by high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures, reflecting significant periods of price decline.

The dramatic increase in CAGR and MDD between 2018-2021 is particularly notable.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $237.97
* **5-day Moving Average:** $240.50
* **20-day Moving Average:** $255.04
* **60-day Moving Average:** $293.82

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price increase of $4.6 (from previous close of $227.5) might be a short-term bounce, warranting further investigation.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.73 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.11 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.4% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 696.7% (significantly higher than S&P 500, implying significant outperformance is expected, however this is a high-risk high-reward scenario).  The price increase of $4.6 could be a short-term fluctuation, thus not affecting the long-term expectation drastically.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows relatively consistent revenue around $25 billion per quarter, with some fluctuation. EPS figures are also fairly consistent, with slight variations.  More data is needed for a more comprehensive analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's historical performance has been exceptionally strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this has been accompanied by high volatility.  Current indicators suggest a potential short-term downward trend, but the long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, remains positive, though inherently very risky.  Further analysis of the recent dip in ROE and the consistency of earnings is needed for a complete assessment.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with Tesla's volatility before making any investment decisions. The significant divergence from the market warrants ongoing monitoring and a thorough understanding of the underlying factors driving Tesla's performance.
