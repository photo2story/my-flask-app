## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Performance Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows significantly higher returns for TSLA compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, although recent performance has been more volatile.  Key indicators like RSI and PPO suggest a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment.  However, the high expected return needs further context.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 1184.15%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** 1094.71% (This is the difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point)
* **Relative Divergence:** 67.3% (This indicates TSLA's performance is in the 67.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO).  

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows TSLA's significant outperformance (high alpha) relative to the market (beta significantly higher than 1 in some periods reflecting high volatility), particularly in the 2018-2021 period. However, recent years (2021-2023) show negative CAGR, highlighting the risk associated with its high growth and volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $268.46
* **Last Market Price:** $280.59 (a recent increase of $4.52)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $267.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $254.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $331.42

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend but a longer-term downtrend from its peak. The recent price jump from previous closing suggests a notable upward movement that may warrant further analysis of underlying news and market events.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.04 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 2.25 (Positive; suggests bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.8% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return:** 466.3% (This high expected return, relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon, needs to be critically assessed considering the inherent volatility of Tesla.)

The recent price increase of $4.52 shows a notable short-term upward movement, possibly indicating a market reaction to positive news or a short squeeze.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68  | $25.18B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68  | $25.18B      |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46  | $25.50B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.46  | $25.50B      |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37  | $21.30B      |

The data shows some inconsistencies.  There are duplicated entries for dates 2025-01-30. Revenue shows some fluctuation, but no clear upward or downward trend is immediately apparent without further analysis to determine the cause of the fluctuations.  EPS seems to fluctuate with revenue, possibly indicating the companyâ€™s reliance on sales volume to impact profitability. More data is needed for robust trend analysis.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B     | 16.26%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B     | 19.84%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B     | 17.95%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B     | 17.35%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B     | 17.63%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity      | ROE           |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B     | 3.23%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B     | 3.10%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B     | 2.22%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38B     | 1.75%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B     | 12.66%        |


Revenue shows relatively consistent performance, except for a dip in Q1 2024. Profit margins fluctuate but remain relatively stable. Equity is steadily increasing. ROE shows a significant drop in recent quarters which needs further investigation to determine the cause (e.g., increased debt, changes in accounting standards).  The 12.66% ROE in Q4 2023 is an outlier.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock performance has historically outpaced the S&P 500 significantly, but this has come with substantial volatility.  Recent performance shows a mix of positive and negative signals. While the high projected return is promising, the considerable risk associated with TSLA must be acknowledged.  The inconsistent earnings data and the sharp decrease in ROE require further examination. A thorough fundamental analysis, incorporating macroeconomic factors and industry trends, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data alone does not offer a complete picture; further research is strongly recommended.
