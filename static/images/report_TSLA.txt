## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1316.95%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1199.4%.  The relative divergence of 72.5% indicates that TSLA's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this is a relative measure and doesn't predict future performance. The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a modest outperformance compared to the market, although this is highly volatile year to year. Beta values are highly volatile, reflecting the high risk associated with TSLA.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $430.60
* **Last Market Price:** $462.28 (This indicates a recent price increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $441.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $396.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $311.40

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend, but the gap between the last market price and closing price suggests a possible correction.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.84 –  Approaching overbought territory (generally above 70).
* **PPO:** -0.64 – Negative value suggesting bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.0% – Indicates a recent short-term price decline.
* **Expected Return:** 857.5% –  This represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) assuming consistent past performance continues.  This is a very high-risk, high-reward projection.  The 462.28 last market price, compared to the 430.60 closing price, could indicate a short-term price jump.  Further analysis is required to determine whether this is a sustained trend or a temporary fluctuation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates between $21.30B and $25.50B, showing some inconsistent growth. There is no clear upward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS also fluctuates, with no consistent upward trend.  The 0.68 EPS in the latest quarter is noteworthy.

Without expectations data, it's impossible to definitively label any results as "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable but shows some fluctuation. Profit margins are relatively stable around 17-19%, suggesting good profitability, though there is a slight decrease in recent quarters.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has been increasing generally, but ROE is highly volatile, with a significant drop in the quarter ending 2024-03-31. This volatility underscores the risk associated with TSLA.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

Looking for news related to earnings announcements, product launches, regulatory changes, and market sentiment is crucial.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock shows significant long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, the high volatility in both price and financial metrics indicates a significant risk.  The recent price increase needs further analysis to determine if it's sustainable.  Technical indicators suggest a possible overbought condition and short-term bearish momentum.  The inconsistent revenue and EPS growth require a deeper dive into the underlying factors driving these numbers.  The high projected long-term return should be approached with caution, given the inherent volatility of the stock.  More data, particularly current news and analyst sentiment, is needed for a complete assessment.
