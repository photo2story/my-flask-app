**Analysis of the Table:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows extremely high growth rates, especially in the 2018-2025 period. This reflects Tesla's rapid expansion and stock appreciation.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD values indicate significant volatility and risk. Investors need to be prepared for substantial price swings.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently positive and very high, meaning Tesla has significantly outperformed its benchmark *after* accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:**  Generally low (close to 0), which is somewhat unexpected for such a volatile stock. A beta close to 0 indicates less systematic risk, or that the stock's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market. However, the beta increased to 0.8 by 2023-2025, which could indicate that TSLA's price is becoming more correlated with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization of TSLA stock, which shows an increasing trend.
