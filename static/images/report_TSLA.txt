## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1316.95%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1199.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 72.5% indicates that TSLA's performance is substantially higher than the S&P 500 based on the historical range of their relative performance.  The provided Alpha and Beta values illustrate TSLA's high growth (CAGR exceeding 1000% in certain periods) but also its volatility (high MDD figures reflecting substantial drawdowns). Note the dramatic swings in CAGR, particularly the -456% in 2021-2023 and the subsequent recovery.  This highlights the inherent risk associated with TSLA investment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly results show some volatility.  Revenue was highest in Q2 2024 ($25.50B), followed by Q3 2024 ($25.18B) and Q4 2023 ($25.17B).  EPS peaked in Q3 2024 ($0.68), then declined to $0.46 and $0.37 in the following quarters. This is followed by a rise in Q4 2024 to $0.58, and the data shows a repeat of the same information. There's a lack of consistency in the provided EPS and revenue data requiring clarification.  Notably, comparing similar quarters, there are no significant revenue changes across quarters year over year.  There's also no information available to compare against expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue fluctuates, but overall shows strong growth.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins generally remain consistent, showing minor fluctuations.
* **Equity:** Equity shows a steady increase with one minor dip (Q1 2024).
* **ROE:** ROE exhibits significant volatility, most strikingly with a large jump from 3.47% (Q3 2023) to 12.66% (Q4 2023), followed by a substantial decline again in subsequent quarters. This high ROE figure in 2023-12-31 needs further investigation to find the cause.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires current news data to be populated.  No information is provided in the prompt regarding recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions.)

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows exceptional growth over the long term, massively outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance is characterized by significant volatility, as evidenced by the large drawdowns and fluctuating CAGR figures.  Recent price action indicates a short-term upward trend, but the high RSI suggests potential for a near-term correction.  The provided earnings data is inconsistent and lacks sufficient information to make definitive conclusions.  Profitability metrics are fairly stable. The projection of an 857.5% expected return is extraordinarily high and highly uncertain.  Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to obtain current market analysis, earnings expectations, and consider the significant risk associated with TSLAâ€™s volatile performance. Further investigation is required regarding the inconsistencies in the provided financial data.
