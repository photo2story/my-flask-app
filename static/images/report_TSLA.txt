## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Tesla, Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  This report analyzes Tesla's performance based on provided financial and market data, comparing its returns to the S&P 500 (VOO) and assessing its current market position.  Key metrics include cumulative returns, moving averages, RSI, PPO, and financial statements.

**1. Return Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return (1053.45%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (121.84%). The current divergence is 931.6, placing it at the 57th percentile of historical divergence (max: 1673.1, min: -53.2).  This indicates a historically high level of outperformance relative to the S&P 500, although this does not guarantee future performance.

The provided CAGR data reveals high growth (1069% and 1463% in 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 respectively) punctuated by significant negative returns (-456% in 2021-2023 and -59% in 2022-2024).  Alpha values fluctuate, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (Beta).  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has shown substantial growth over the analyzed period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $355.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $345.50
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $384.57
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $392.12

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend in the short-term.  The recent slight price decrease (-$0.10) from the previous close is not significant enough to qualify as a sharp drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.87):**  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-1.28):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-1.3):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.

The combination of these indicators points towards a bearish short-term outlook.  However, the expected return of 553.9% over the long term (2+ years) suggests significant potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500, if the long-term growth trend resumes.

| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B   | 12.66%  |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock shows a history of dramatic swings and high growth potential but also substantial risk.  While the long-term expected return is highly positive, the current short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend. The significant divergence from the S&P 500 is historically high, but sustainability is uncertain.  Inconsistencies and potential data errors in the provided earnings and financial data necessitate further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions.  A thorough examination of the factors driving the volatility and the reasons behind the fluctuations in ROE and the duplicated earnings data is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
