## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1146.88%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 129.75%. The difference in cumulative return is 1017.1 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 58.9% indicates that TSLA's performance has been considerably higher than the S&P 500 over the historical period considered, placing it in the higher range of past performance differences.  However, note that this relative divergence is a snapshot based on past performance, and doesn't guarantee future returns.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable CAGR and Alpha (0.0 consistently) across different time periods, suggesting substantial volatility and market sensitivity.  Beta is not consistently available to calculate a clear market sensitivity measure.  The dramatic swings in CAGR, particularly the exceptionally high returns in 2018-2021 followed by steep declines in 2021-2024, highlight the risk associated with TSLA investment. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) increased significantly over the analyzed period. The consistently low alpha values suggest the company has performed mostly in line with overall market movements,  and its high CAGR periods reflect general market strength amplified by TSLA's specific drivers.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $351.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $344.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $329.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $269.68

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although this needs further analysis with more contextual market information.  The gap between the closing price and the 60-day MA indicates a relatively recent strong price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 59.21 –  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.57 –  Indicates a bearish signal, suggesting downward price momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (-) –  The missing value prevents interpretation of recent relative divergence.  
* **Expected Return:** 1099.3% – This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500, assuming continued performance trends.  However, this high expectation should be considered with caution given historical volatility.  The current price ($351.9) is higher than the last market price ($351.42), reflecting a slight recent increase and not showing a dramatic uptrend or downtrend based on the provided information alone.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, but this comes with substantial volatility.  The recent price action shows a potential upward trend, though indicators are mixed (positive price movement, neutral RSI, bearish PPO).  Earnings data show fluctuating revenue and EPS. Financial data reveals variable profitability.  The exceptionally high projected return should be treated with caution due to the inherent volatility in the company's historical performance.
