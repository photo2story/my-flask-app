## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:** Tesla Inc., an electric vehicle and clean energy company, exhibits significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  While recent price action shows some volatility, long-term projections indicate strong potential for outperformance.  However, the high beta suggests substantial market sensitivity.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) shows a cumulative return of 2629.12%, drastically outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 85.20%.  The provided relative divergence of 84.1% indicates TSLA's performance is significantly higher than the majority of historical periods compared to the VOO.  This massive difference underscores TSLA's exceptional growth, but also its inherent volatility.

The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta analysis highlights the dramatic swings in TSLA's performance. While exhibiting consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), the high Beta values indicate significant sensitivity to overall market movements.  The high Alpha values in recent years suggest outperformance compared to the market, yet past performance is not indicative of future results.  The fluctuating Alpha shows the considerable uncertainty surrounding TSLA's future performance.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

TSLA's current closing price is $282.16.  The stock experienced a recent decline, with a closing price of $282.16 compared to a previous close of $292.03, a change of -$3.38.

* 5-day moving average: $280.91
* 20-day moving average: $256.58
* 60-day moving average: $281.86

The stock price is currently slightly below its 60-day moving average, indicating a recent period of consolidation or slight downward pressure, following a short period of price increases above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3721 (Medium Risk) suggesting a relatively moderate level of risk.
* **RSI:** 54.06, indicating the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning slightly toward overbought territory.
* **PPO:** 2.5, a positive value suggesting bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** +9.6%, a positive change, indicating short-term upward momentum.

The significant negative price change of -$3.38 suggests a potential short-term correction or consolidation after a period of price growth.  There is no immediate indication of a crash or extreme volatility, although the price is still relatively near the highs for the stock.

* **Expected Return:** 479.8% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500. This is a very aggressive and potentially unrealistic figure. It must be heavily discounted due to the inherent risks related to TSLA's volatile nature.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue figures. While revenue generally shows upward growth, EPS isn't consistently increasing, possibly due to fluctuations in profitability.  Further analysis is required to understand the drivers behind these variations.  Data duplication appears in the provided table, requiring clarification before proper interpretation.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-04-23 | 0.13 | $19.34 B    |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.68 | $25.18 B    |
| 2025-01-30 | 0.68 | $25.18 B    |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.46 | $25.50 B    |
| 2025-01-30 | 0.46 | $25.50 B    |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows some instability in profitability, which needs further investigation. While revenue shows consistent growth in recent quarters (except for a dip in Q1 2025), profit margins fluctuate, potentially affecting overall profitability.  The ROE (Return on Equity) also shows some volatility, which needs careful evaluation.  The high revenue numbers do suggest a growing business, but the less consistent profit margins and ROE raises some concerns regarding profitability.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $19.34B | 16.31% |
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B | 16.26% |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B | 19.84% |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B | 17.95% |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B | 17.35% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's past performance has been exceptionally strong, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, this performance is associated with substantial volatility and market sensitivity (high beta).  Recent price action suggests a potential consolidation period after a period of strong price increases. While long-term projections suggest significant potential, investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with TSLA's volatile nature.  The data provided requires clarification (duplicate earnings data) and further analysis to fully assess the financial health and future prospects of the company.  The very high projected return should be treated with considerable skepticism.  A more in-depth analysis, incorporating additional financial metrics and industry comparisons, is crucial for a more comprehensive evaluation.
