## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA (1136.42) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (125.6) over the analyzed period. The difference in cumulative returns is 1010.82. This places TSLA at the 58.59th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 1763.87, min: -54.48).  The high relative divergence suggests a strong outperformance compared to the broader market, though it's crucial to remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis show high alpha values (significantly outperforming the market benchmark) and Beta values consistently above 1 (higher volatility than the market), particularly during periods of significant growth (2018-2021). The recent decline in CAGR (2022-2024) and negative alpha suggest a period of underperformance relative to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $346.0
* **5-day Moving Average:** $329.38
* **20-day Moving Average:** $287.4
* **60-day Moving Average:** $250.1

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend, although the relatively small difference between the closing price and 5-day moving average indicates a recent slowing of the momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (72.22):** Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (1.59):** Positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+24.77):** Shows recent strong upward movement relative to the broader market.
* **Expected Return (101.61%):**  Suggests a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if current trends continue.  This is a projection and not a guarantee.  The high closing price of $346 might be attributed to factors like anticipation for future products or strong investor sentiment. This could potentially indicate a period of consolidation or even a short-term correction due to overbought conditions.  Given the high price and overbought RSI, a short-term pullback is possible.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided quarterly financial data shows some fluctuations in revenue and EPS.  While revenue generally remained high, profit margins have shown some variability.  Missing data makes detailed analysis difficult. The latest earnings report ($0.68 EPS, $25.18B revenue) needs to be compared to analysts' expectations to ascertain its impact.
