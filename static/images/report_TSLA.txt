The long-term outlook is positive based on the expected return, but investors should be aware of the high risk and volatility associated with this stock.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and a more in-depth analysis of the financial statements is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The recent price drop warrants monitoring for potential further corrections.
