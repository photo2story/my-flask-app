2025-04-17 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**0) Overview:** Tesla Inc. is a leading designer, developer, manufacturer, and seller of electric vehicles, battery energy storage devices, and solar panels.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Tesla's cumulative return of 2236.34% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 76.08%.  The difference is 2160.26%, placing it at the 71.7th percentile of its historical range (max 3037.1%, min -65.1%).  This indicates Tesla's substantial outperformance relative to the broader market, although this high relative performance may not be sustainable.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data further underscores this significant outperformance.  However, it is crucial to note the high volatility (MDD - Maximum Drawdown) experienced in some periods. The exceptionally high CAGR figures from 2018 onwards suggest periods of rapid growth, interspersed with substantial risk.  The relatively low beta values (generally below 1) in some periods suggest lower correlation with the overall market than one might initially assume based on the dramatic price swings.  The increasing beta from 2021 onwards suggests increasing market correlation. Capitalization (Cap(B)) has seen substantial growth.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $241.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $250.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $257.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $302.61

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend. The recent price drop of $4.94 (from $254.11 to $241.55) signals a significant downward movement.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41, suggesting a medium risk level.
* **RSI:** 41.37, indicating the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** 0.49, a positive value suggesting potential upward momentum, but low values imply relative weakness.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -9.5%, indicating a recent period of underperformance.
* **Expected Return:** 673.2% â€“ A high expected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is projected, though this should be viewed cautiously given the inherent volatility of this stock.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entries).  Assuming the unique data points represent the correct values, revenue is relatively consistent across quarters, but EPS shows variability.  Further analysis would require more complete and verified data.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18B       |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46 | $25.50B       |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30B       |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows relatively stable performance, although there's a dip in Q1 2024. Profit margins fluctuate but generally remain healthy.  Equity is growing steadily, but ROE displays significant volatility, with a notable drop in recent quarters and an unusually high value at the end of 2023, indicating an anomaly requiring investigation.  This volatility in ROE highlights the need for further investigation.

**6) Summary:**

Tesla's performance dramatically outpaces the S&P 500, showing extremely high growth rates, but also very high volatility.  While the recent price action reveals a bearish short-term trend, the long-term outlook, based on the expected return, remains bullish.  However, considerable caution is warranted due to the high volatility and relatively low and fluctuating ROE. Thorough fundamental analysis, considering factors like competition, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic conditions, is crucial before making any investment decisions. The inconsistency and lack of completeness in the provided financial data necessitates further investigation to gain a complete understanding.  The high expected return should be viewed skeptically until additional data and analysis can be performed.
