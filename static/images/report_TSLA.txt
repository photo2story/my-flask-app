## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 1109.94% for TSLA compared to 128.31% for the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative return is 981.63%, placing it at the 56.98th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500.  While this indicates significant outperformance, the relative outperformance indicator is crucial to remember:  It shows where the current performance sits within its historical range, not a guaranteed future performance.

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals high growth potential (CAGR ranging from 42% to 1603.8% across different periods) and substantial volatility (MDD from 32.3% to 73.3%), reflecting Tesla's high-growth, high-risk profile. The Beta consistently above 1 suggests higher volatility than the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $338.59 (Last Market: $338.44)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $343.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $305.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $259.05

The price is currently above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, it's slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating some recent price consolidation or a minor pullback.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (70.85):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70), suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.28):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (14.29% +):**  Shows a recent increase in relative strength against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (102.49%):**  Indicates a significant potential for outperformance over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500, if the current trend continues.  This is a projection, not a guarantee. The closing price of $338.44 is not significantly different enough to suggest a sudden major price movement (either a sharp increase or decline).


**4. Recent Financials and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS. While revenue generally remains high, there's some quarter-to-quarter variation.  The latest earnings report (2024-10-24) shows EPS of $0.68 and revenue of $25.18B.  A comparison with analyst expectations for this quarter is needed to accurately assess performance.  Additional data such as profit margins and operating cash flow is necessary to paint a complete picture.


**5. Financial Data Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is consistently high but profit margins fluctuate between 17% and 19.84%, indicating some variability in profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown steady growth. ROE (Return on Equity) is highly variable, indicating fluctuations in the company's ability to generate profits from its shareholders' equity.  The significant jump in ROE in 2023-12-31 needs further investigation to identify the contributing factors.
