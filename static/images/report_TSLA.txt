## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:**

Tesla Inc., a leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, exhibits significant performance discrepancies compared to the S&P 500 (VOO). While its cumulative return significantly outperforms the benchmark, recent performance shows volatility and a bearish trend.  Further analysis is needed to ascertain its future prospects.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Tesla's cumulative return of 849.69% drastically surpasses the S&P 500's 116.17% cumulative return.  The current divergence of 733.5 points, placing it at the 45.6th percentile of historical divergence (max 1673.1, min -53.2), highlights Tesla's significant outperformance relative to its historical volatility against the S&P 500. However, the large swings in alpha and beta (see table below) indicate substantial risk and volatility.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |

| 2023-2025  | 265.0%   | 27.5%    | 208.0% | 1.1   | 959.6  |


The highly volatile CAGR and Alpha values over time suggest periods of extreme outperformance and underperformance, indicating substantial risk. The Beta values, while generally low, show increasing sensitivity to market movements in recent years.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $292.98
* **Last Market Price:** $298.26 (a 1.8% increase from the previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $299.81
* **20-day Moving Average:** $346.40
* **60-day Moving Average:** $389.32

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 28.34 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -2.01 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.3% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 815.8% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected in the long term,  but volatility is expected to be high).
The recent price increase (1.8%) is relatively small and does not signal a significant rebound.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18B      |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46 | $25.50B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.46 | $25.50B      |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30B      |

There seems to be a data duplication in the table.  Revenue appears relatively stable, though EPS fluctuates. More data is needed for a robust analysis.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B    | 16.26%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B    | 19.84%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B    | 17.95%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B    | 17.35%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B    | 17.63%        |

Revenue shows some fluctuation but is generally stable. Profit margins are healthy, though there's some quarter-to-quarter variance.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE    |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B    | 3.23%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B    | 3.10%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B    | 2.22%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38B    | 1.75%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B    | 12.66% |

Equity is increasing steadily, but ROE shows significant variation, particularly the drop from Q4 2023 to subsequent quarters. This needs further investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's long-term performance has been exceptional, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent data reveals short-term bearish trends, indicated by the moving averages, RSI, PPO, and relative divergence.  While the long-term expected return is highly positive, the significant volatility and the need for clarification on the duplicated earnings data necessitate cautious interpretation.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the fluctuations in ROE and the apparent data duplication in the earnings report is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Investors should be prepared for significant price swings.
