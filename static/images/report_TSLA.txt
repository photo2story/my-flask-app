**Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**
The analysis confirms TSLA's profile as a high-risk, high-reward growth stock:

1.  **Explosive Alpha Generation:** The periods 2018-2021 saw extraordinary Alpha (568% to 715%), reflecting the peak hyper-growth phase. While recent Alpha figures (2022-2025) remain exceptionally high (450% to 573%), they are accompanied by a sharp increase in market risk.
2.  **Increasing Volatility (Beta & MDD):** The stock's Beta has steadily risen from 1.3 (2016-2021) to 2.3 (2023-2025), indicating that TSLA is now 2.3 times more sensitive to overall market movements than it was historically.

### 3) Technical Indicators and Risk Assessment

| Indicator | Value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Market Risk Indicator (MRI)** | 0.7 | Low Investment Recommended (Borderline High Risk) |
| **RSI (14-day)** | 33.49 | Approaching Oversold Territory (<30) |
| **PPO (Momentum)** | -1.1126 | Bearish Momentum (Short MA below Long MA) |
| **Relative Divergence Change (20-day)** | +1.0 | Short-term rise in outperformance relative to VOO |
| **Expected Return (%)** | 398.6% | Estimated long-term excess return vs S&P 500 |

**Simple Analysis:**
Technical signals present a mixed picture:

*   **Risk Profile:** The MRI of 0.7 suggests elevated risk (Low Investment category).
*   **Momentum/Condition:** The stock is showing signs of being oversold (RSI 33.49), often preceding a bounce. However, the negative PPO confirms that the momentum trend is bearish overall.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The aggressive "Buy 100% of cash" signal, paired with the low RSI and recent positive relative divergence change, suggests that the model sees a near-term entry opportunity based on recent weakness and historical volatility patterns. The long-term Expected Return remains exceptionally high, driven by TSLA's historical Alpha.

### 5) Recent Earnings Analysis

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-10-23 | 0.43 | $28.09 B |
| 2025-07-24 | 0.36 | $22.50 B |
| 2025-04-23 | 0.13 | $19.34 B |

| 2025-01-30 | 0.68 | $25.18 B |

**Analysis of Quarterly Earnings:**
Revenue showed substantial growth from the trough in Q1 2025 ($19.34B) to Q3 2025 ($28.09B), signaling a strong recovery in sales volume. However, EPS has been highly volatile. Q1 2025 ($0.13) was notably weak, likely reflecting significant price cuts or high operating costs. While EPS has shown a sequential recovery ($0.36 then $0.43), it remains below the performance levels seen in Q4 2024 ($0.68), indicating that profitability per vehicle sold is under pressure despite rising revenue.

### 6) Financial Information

#### Revenue and Profitability

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-09-30 | $28.09B | 17.99% |
| 2025-06-30 | $22.50B | 17.24% |
| 2025-03-31 | $19.34B | 16.31% |
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B | 16.26% |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B | 19.84% |

**Analysis:** Revenue growth is accelerating, particularly into Q3 2025. Crucially, Profit Margin has been improving sequentially since Q4 2024 (16.26% to 17.99% in Q3 2025), suggesting that recent cost controls or improved product mix are starting to stabilize or rebound overall profitability, following the pressure seen in late 2024.

#### Capital and Profitability

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-09-30 | $79.97B | 1.72% |
| 2025-06-30 | $77.31B | 1.52% |
| 2025-03-31 | $74.65B | 0.55% |
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B | 3.17% |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B | 3.11% |

**Analysis:** While shareholder equity continues to rise, the Return on Equity (ROE) has drastically declined from above 3% in late 2024 to extremely low levels in 2025 (0.55% to 1.72%). This metric is a major concern, as it indicates that the company is currently generating very little profit relative to the capital invested by shareholders, suggesting poor capital efficiency during this recent period of growth and volatility.

### 7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)

TSLA has historically delivered spectacular returns, achieving cumulative growth of 1049.98% compared to the S&P 500’s 94.03%. This historical success is captured in its projected long-term excess return of nearly 400%.

**Risk and Technicals:** However, the stock currently operates under a severely heightened risk profile (Beta 2.3, MDD 57.1%, MRI 0.7). Technically, the stock is oversold (RSI 33.49) and experienced a recent sharp rebound (+2.11%), triggering an aggressive short-term Buy signal from the hybrid model. Despite the rebound, intermediate momentum remains bearish (below 20-day SMA, negative PPO).

**Fundamentals and Sentiment:** Fundamentally, revenue growth is strong, and profit margins are recovering. The main red flag is the highly volatile EPS and the critically low Return on Equity (ROE) throughout 2025, which suggests significant challenges in converting high revenue growth into efficient shareholder profit. This operational struggle is reflected in highly polarized analyst opinions; the stock's current price ($445.01) exceeds the conservative average analyst target price ($403.32), indicating skepticism about its current valuation.

**Conclusion:** TSLA remains a high-beta, high-volatility stock. While technical indicators suggest it is momentarily undervalued following a pullback, fundamental data points (especially the low ROE) signal ongoing struggles with profitability and capital efficiency. Long-term investment remains predicated on the belief that historical high Alpha will continue, but investors must accept extreme volatility and a divergence between market pricing and cautious analyst valuation.
