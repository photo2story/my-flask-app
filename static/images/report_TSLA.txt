## Tesla Inc (TSLA) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA (1187.93%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (37.39%) over the analyzed period. The difference in cumulative returns is 1150.5%.  This places the stock's relative outperformance at the 57.7th percentile of its historical range (max: 1749.8%, min: 333.3%).  The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility, with large swings in performance across different periods.  Alpha consistently remains around 1.0, suggesting the stock's performance is not significantly explained by market movements alone.  Beta is also high, indicating high sensitivity to market fluctuations.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $394.36
* **Last Market Price:** $396.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $399.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $425.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $337.06

The stock is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.  The Last Market price being slightly higher than the Closing Price suggests potential for short-term recovery, but it needs to be confirmed by more substantial price increase above moving averages to signal strong upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.18 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a short-term rebound.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -2.48 – This negative value also suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -6.0% – This points to a recent short-term price decline.
* **Expected Return:** 599.6% – This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return compared to the S&P 500, assuming a consistent long-term investment strategy.  This high expected return needs to be viewed critically, as it’s based on past performance which isn't indicative of future results. This high return is largely driven by significant past gains and their subsequent projection.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some volatility in both revenue and EPS. While revenue generally remained strong, exceeding $21B in each quarter, there was a slight dip in Q1 2024.  EPS also fluctuated, with the highest EPS reported in Q4 2024 ($0.68).  There is inconsistent data for Q4 2024 (October 24th listed twice with different values).  Clarification on this inconsistency is needed for a thorough analysis.  A more detailed breakdown comparing these figures to analyst expectations is required to assess whether these results represent a "beat" or "miss."


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue remained relatively stable around $25B in the last two quarters, showing some growth. However, there is a notable drop in revenue during Q1 2024, indicating seasonal or temporary factors at play.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have shown some fluctuation, but generally remain healthy, exceeding 17% throughout the reported period. The highest profit margin (19.84%) was reported in Q3 2024.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity has steadily increased throughout the reported period. Return on Equity (ROE) shows substantial volatility, however, with a sharp decrease between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, before starting to climb again. This requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to be completed.  Without this information, a comprehensive analysis cannot be provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has been highly volatile, showing periods of significant growth followed by substantial declines.  While the long-term cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500, this high performance should be analyzed cautiously given the significant swings in CAGR. Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, though oversold conditions (RSI) hint at a potential near-term rebound. Earnings reports indicate strong revenue overall but with fluctuations, while profit margins are consistently healthy.  Significant volatility is also observed in both ROE and the EPS. The provided expected return should be viewed with skepticism, as it relies heavily on past performance and not necessarily a projection of future gains.  More information regarding current news, market sentiment, and analyst opinions, alongside a clarification of inconsistent data points from the financial reports, is crucial for a complete investment assessment.
