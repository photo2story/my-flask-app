## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return for TSLA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 1081.7 (1194.46 - 112.74).  The relative divergence of 65.7% indicates that TSLA's performance is substantially above the S&P 500 compared to its historical range of performance differences.  However, it's crucial to remember that this relative divergence is a measure relative to its own past performance differences with the S&P 500, not an absolute measure of outperformance. The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting that the stock's outperformance is consistently modest despite significant swings in CAGR.  High beta values, especially in 2018-2021, indicate a high sensitivity to overall market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $396.36
* **5-day Moving Average:** $396.74
* **20-day Moving Average:** $423.04
* **60-day Moving Average:** $348.92

The price is currently below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential longer-term support.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.46 (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting the stock might be slightly oversold.)
* **PPO:** -1.91 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.5% (Indicates a recent decline in relative performance.)
* **Expected Return:** 429.6% (This represents a significant potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance against the S&P 500, assuming consistent outperformance relative to historical trends.  This is highly speculative and should not be considered a guaranteed return.)

The current price of $396.36 doesn't signal a drastic price change (neither a significant uptrend nor a significant downtrend), given the context of the other indicators. However, the combination of a low RSI, a negative PPO, and a declining relative divergence warrants caution.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has demonstrated exceptionally high historical returns compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent indicators suggest a potential short-term slowdown. While the long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, appears optimistic, this should be viewed with extreme caution due to its speculative nature and the inherent volatility of the stock.  The inconsistent and potentially erroneous data regarding earnings and financial information requires further investigation and clarification before drawing definitive conclusions.  The high beta indicates significant risk associated with the investment.  A thorough due diligence process is essential before any investment decisions are made.
