2024-12-20 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1335.27%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 114.28%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1221.0 percentage points.  This places TSLA at the 73.8th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  While a high percentile, it's crucial to remember this is relative to historical performance against the S&P 500 and doesn't guarantee future performance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values, especially between 2018 and 2021, reflecting significant growth. However, the 2021-2023 period shows a substantial negative CAGR, highlighting the volatility inherent in TSLA's stock. The consistently low beta values suggest that TSLA's price movements have been relatively independent of overall market trends.  The Alpha values generally positive (although small in magnitude and mostly 0.1), indicating potential outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  However, the periods with extremely high CAGR and correspondingly high Alpha are offset by the drastic negative CAGR seen in 2021-2023, highlighting the inherent risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $436.17
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $451.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $388.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $305.78

The price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The gap between the 5-day and 20-day MA suggests recent downward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 72.41 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.47 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 838.2% (This is a significant long-term projected excess return over the S&P 500. It is important to note that such high long-term projected returns are exceptionally high and should be treated with a significant degree of caution given the inherent volatility of TSLA.)

Given the current price of $436.17, which is below the 5-day MA and relatively close to the 20-day MA, a short-term consolidation or minor correction seems possible, though no significant 20-day relative divergence is noted.  The expected return, while impressive, must be viewed with substantial skepticism due to the high volatility of Tesla stock.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* **Latest Quarterly Results:** Revenue decreased slightly from Q2 2024 ($25.50B) to Q3 2024 ($25.18B), but EPS increased from $0.46 to $0.68. This indicates an improvement in profitability despite a slight revenue dip.  There is a discrepancy in the provided table which shows two entries for 2024-10-24, potentially an error needing clarification.
* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue has fluctuated over the past few quarters, showing some inconsistency and not revealing a clear consistent upward trend.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS has been generally increasing, although the trend isn't strictly monotonic. There is some fluctuation that needs to be considered.
* **Beats or Misses:**  It is impossible to determine beats or misses without information on analysts' expectations. The reported numbers are given without context for comparison.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation; profit margin is generally healthy but has shown some variability over the past few quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown growth, but ROE (Return on Equity) is highly volatile, with significant swings between quarters. This points to potential short-term shifts in profitability and/or leverage.

The financial data points to profitability, but the volatility suggests a high-risk, high-reward investment.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided. To complete this section, real-time information would be needed.  The current market outlook for Tesla needs to be assessed through external current market data.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla (TSLA) shows substantial long-term growth potential as reflected in the historical data, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the stock is extremely volatile, as demonstrated by the substantial swings in both price and financial metrics. Recent price action shows a short-term downtrend that may be a temporary correction.   The high expected return is exceptionally high and therefore speculative and needs additional validation.  Thorough due diligence, incorporating up-to-date news, market analysis, and independent financial projections, is crucial before making any investment decision.  The extreme volatility should be considered a primary risk factor.
