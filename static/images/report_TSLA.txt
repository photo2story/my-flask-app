2025-04-15 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return (2340.80%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (66.69%). The difference is 2274.1%, placing it at the 75th percentile of historical divergence based on a range of 3050.7% (max) to -60.4% (min).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance with substantial swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown). While Beta is generally high, indicating significant market correlation, Alpha fluctuates wildly, sometimes being significantly positive, suggesting periods of outperformance.  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects Tesla's growth over the years.  However, it's crucial to note that high Alpha values are concentrated in specific periods and do not guarantee future performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $252.35
* **5-day Moving Average:** $250.22
* **20-day Moving Average:** $256.15
* **60-day Moving Average:** $308.53

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change of $0.02 indicates minimal daily movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk) indicating relatively high market volatility.
* **RSI:** 40.37 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.71 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)

The RSI and PPO show conflicting signals. While the RSI suggests bearish momentum, the PPO indicates bullish momentum.  The 20-day relative divergence change of +5.5 indicates a short-term upward trend.  The minimal daily price change does not reflect significant volatility. The expected return of 616.0% over the long term (2+ years) represents a substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this should be viewed cautiously given the inherent volatility and risk.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30B      |

There seems to be some duplication in the earnings data.  Revenue seems relatively stable, while EPS shows some fluctuation.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the discrepancies and repeated entries.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity      | ROE           |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B     | 3.23%         |

| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B     | 12.66%        |

Equity is steadily increasing, but ROE shows significant variation, notably dropping significantly from Q4 2023 to subsequent quarters.  This requires further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla exhibits a history of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility.  Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, though conflicting signals from technical indicators (RSI and PPO) need clarification.  While the long-term expected return is high, the high risk (MRI) necessitates caution.  Inconsistencies in the earnings data and a significant drop in ROE warrant further investigation.  A deeper dive into the underlying factors driving revenue, profitability, and ROE fluctuations is necessary for a more robust assessment.  Given the high volatility, any investment decision should consider a long-term horizon and a risk tolerance appropriate for this level of market exposure.
