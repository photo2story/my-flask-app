* **20-Day Moving Average:** $416.57
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $324.00

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, indicating a recent downward trend. However, it's slightly above its 20-day moving average, suggesting some support at current levels.

* **Expected Return:** 380.0% (A long-term (2+ years) investment is projected to yield a 380% return exceeding the S&P 500's return.)

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically. However, recent performance shows volatility.  While the long-term expected return is high, the short-term trend appears bearish based on the moving averages and PPO.  The recent earnings show relatively stable revenue but fluctuating EPS and profit margins.  Analyzing the ROE also reveals significant variation in profitability. Further data, including up-to-date news and analyst opinions, is necessary for a more complete and accurate assessment.  The data provided lacks critical elements needed for a truly holistic assessment, particularly regarding recent market sentiment and analyst expectations that would provide context to the reported financial numbers.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data requires clarification.
