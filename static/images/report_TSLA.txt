However, the high relative divergence also suggests a potential for reversion to the mean, requiring further analysis of risk factors.  The historical Alpha and Beta values in the following table are also key indicators of this outperformance and risk.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 29.0%    | 52.4%    | 0.0%  | -0.1  | 66.8   |

The table reveals periods of exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), particularly from 2018 onwards, which also correlates with high Alpha values, indicating significant outperformance relative to the benchmark. However, high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight the significant risk associated with TSLA.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $272.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $246.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $254.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $316.55

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The significant price increase from the previous close (221.86 to 272.2) indicates a recent sharp upswing, potentially due to recent market sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 58.25 (Slightly above the neutral 50 level, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.62 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 517.3% (Significant excess return over S&P 500 expected)

The high MRI score reflects the inherent volatility of TSLA. While the RSI and PPO suggest some bullish momentum, the recent price movement and negative divergence raise concerns about near-term performance. The extremely high expected return should be viewed with caution, as this likely incorporates the high volatility and associated risks.  The 22.69 price change from the previous close supports the observation of a recent sharp price upswing.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla (TSLA) has demonstrated exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this performance comes with significant risk, reflected in high MDD and the high MRI score.  The recent price surge suggests a potential short-term upward trend, however the price is below all three moving averages which indicates a potential bear market.  The long-term outlook is promising, based on projected excess returns.  However, investors should be aware of the substantial volatility and the need for a robust risk management strategy.  More comprehensive financial data and a deeper industry analysis would be necessary for a fully informed investment decision.  It is crucial to consider the potential for substantial price fluctuations given the inherent volatility of the stock.  The current data set, while informative, requires further investigation to provide more conclusive insights.
