**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $479.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $444.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $378.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $299.70

The price is significantly above its recent moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 90.01 –  Extremely overbought, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO:** 1.718 – Positive, indicating upward momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +15.0 – Short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return:** 753.0% – This is a very high projected long-term (2+ years) excess return compared to the S&P 500.  This projection should be viewed with caution, as such high returns are unlikely to be sustained consistently.  The current price is relatively high and the RSI is very overbought.  High returns are likely to be compensated for by high risks.

Given the current price of $479.86 and the high RSI, there is a potential risk of a short-term price correction. While a sharp price increase may have recently happened, an abrupt downturn remains a possibility.
