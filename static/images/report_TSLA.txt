## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Performance Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Tesla Inc., a leading electric vehicle and clean energy company, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While exhibiting high volatility, its exceptional growth potential is evident, though risk associated with high valuation and market sentiment must be considered.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla's cumulative return of 2724.59% drastically surpasses the S&P 500's 85.11% return. The current divergence of 2639.5% sits at the 87.2nd percentile of historical divergence, indicating a historically high level of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this extreme outperformance may not be sustainable.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, especially from 2018 onwards, reflecting periods of substantial growth.  The high and volatile MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures highlight the considerable risk involved in Tesla's investment. The relatively low to moderate Beta values suggest the stock's price movements are somewhat correlated with the overall market, but the alpha shows that it consistently outperforms (though this is more visible in recent years).  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) throughout the periods also reflects the company's considerable expansion.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $292.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $274.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $255.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $283.56

The recent price of $292.03 reflects a $2.15 increase from the previous close ($285.88). The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The proximity to the 60-day average hints at a potential consolidation or short-term correction.

**3. Market Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Medium Risk) – Suggests a moderate level of risk.
* **RSI:** 71.50 – Approaching overbought territory, indicating potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO:** 2.62 – Positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +16.6% (Short-term upward trend).
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 441.4% – Indicates a substantial outperformance over the S&P 500 in the long term, though this is highly speculative. This significant expected return should be viewed cautiously given inherent market volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and relatively stable revenue around $25B.  Further analysis would require additional data to draw conclusive statements about trends. The two duplicate entries (for 2025-01-30 and 2025-01-30) need clarification and correction.  Consistent revenue despite fluctuating EPS suggests potential operating efficiency challenges or strategic investments affecting profitability.


| Date        | EPS   | Revenue     |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-04-23  | $0.13 | $19.34B     |
| 2024-10-24  | $0.68 | $25.18B     |
| 2024-07-24  | $0.46 | $25.50B     |
| 2024-03-31  |  (Data Missing)|$21.30B   |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively stable, although a dip occurred in Q1 2025. Profit margins fluctuate around 16-19%, suggesting some volatility.  Equity has shown steady growth, however, ROE (Return on Equity) is inconsistent. Q4 2024 and Q3 2024 show stronger ROE compared to the rest of the periods. This warrants further investigation into underlying factors influencing profitability and return on equity.

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin | Equity     | ROE    |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------|--------|
| 2025-03-31 | $19.34B   | 16.31%        | $74.65B    | 0.55%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B   | 16.26%        | $72.91B    | 3.23%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B   | 19.84%        | $69.93B    | 3.10%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B   | 17.95%        | $66.47B    | 2.22%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B   | 17.35%        | $64.38B    | 2.16%  |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows exceptional growth but with considerable risk.  Its performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but this extreme outperformance may not be sustainable.  The high valuation and volatility need careful consideration.  A deep dive into the financial statements and industry analysis is crucial to determine the long-term viability and investment potential. The inconsistencies in ROE and profit margins suggest factors affecting Tesla's profitability which require further investigation to determine its sustainability. The recent price movement, while positive, signals the potential for short-term corrections.  Long-term investors should carefully weigh the potential for high returns against the significant inherent risks.  Further data and a more comprehensive analysis would provide a clearer investment recommendation.
