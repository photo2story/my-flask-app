    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying Tesla. This is based on a strategy combining cash and stock allocation, suggesting a preference to be fully invested in Tesla given the current conditions, within the parameters of the indicator.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence suggests that Tesla is underperforming VOO.
    *   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return suggests significant potential upside if the investment is held long-term, but comes with substantial risk.
