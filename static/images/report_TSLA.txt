The high Alpha (1139.0%) and relatively high Beta (1319.0) indicate significant outperformance compared to the market (S&P 500) but also elevated risk.

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B)  |
|------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2015-2025  | 1256.0%   | 73.2%   | 1139.0% | 1319.0  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $415.11
* **Last Market Price:** $411.06
* **5-day Moving Average:** $407.55
* **20-day Moving Average:** $420.25
* **60-day Moving Average:** $355.62

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, the relatively small difference between the last market price and the closing price indicates limited recent volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 37.76 (Below 50, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.01 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 387.5% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 expected over the long term)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest a bearish momentum.  However, the positive 20-day relative divergence change and high expected return suggest the possibility of a short-term reversal and strong long-term growth potential. The fact that the last market price ($411.06) is not significantly different from the closing price doesn't indicate a sudden surge or drop in price.

| Quarter     | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | $69.93        | 3.10    |
| 2024-06-30  | $66.47        | 2.22    |

| 2023-09-30  | $53.47        | 3.47    |

Equity is increasing, but ROE shows significant volatility.  The high ROE in Q4 2023 is notable but needs further investigation to understand the contributing factors.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA demonstrates exceptional long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, it's a highly volatile stock with a high beta, indicating substantial risk.  While recent indicators suggest a potential short-term bearish trend, the strong long-term growth prospects,  combined with the current oversold conditions (RSI), make it a potentially attractive investment for long-term, risk-tolerant investors.  Further investigation is needed into the data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data and the significant ROE fluctuation) before making a definitive investment recommendation.  Consider diversification to mitigate risk.
