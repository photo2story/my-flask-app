* 5-Day Moving Average: 328.13
* 20-Day Moving Average: 275.01
* 60-Day Moving Average: 245.91

The price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  However, the last market price (320.83) is very close to the closing price, indicating limited recent volatility.

* PPO: 1.81 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)

The RSI suggests that the stock might be slightly overbought, while the PPO indicates positive momentum. The positive relative divergence change further confirms a short-term upward trend.  Given that the last market price (320.83) is not significantly higher than the closing price, no major sudden price movement (sharp increase or decrease) is evident. The expected return of 101.23% over the long term (2+ years) represents a substantial potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500.
