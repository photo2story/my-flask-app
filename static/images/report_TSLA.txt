## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA (1219.53%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) (120.40%). The difference in cumulative returns is 1099.1 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering the historical range of the difference, places TSLA at the 66.7th percentile. This indicates a high level of outperformance relative to its historical performance compared to the S&P 500.  However,  it is crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $400.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $381.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $349.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $282.45

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day MA to the current price indicates recent price momentum. The larger gap between the 20-day and 60-day MAs and the current price shows a stronger upward trend in the more recent period.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 73.22  - This suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating a potential short-term pullback.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.45 - A positive PPO suggests upward momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +9.4 -  Positive divergence shows a short-term upward trend.

Given the closing price of $400.88 is not significantly different from the previous day's closing price, there is no immediate indication of a sharp price movement (either up or down).  The expected return of 908.5% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 is a significant prediction and warrants caution as it is a high expectation.  This needs to be considered in the context of risk tolerance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla has demonstrated exceptional performance exceeding the S&P 500 significantly.  However, recent technical indicators suggest a potentially overbought condition, warning of a possible short-term correction.  Earnings show some volatility in revenue but a strong increase in EPS in the most recent quarter.  Financial statements highlight fluctuating ROE, which needs further analysis to determine the causes.  The very high projected long-term return needs to be evaluated with appropriate risk management strategies.
