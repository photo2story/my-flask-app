## TSLA Stock Analysis Report

**Company Overview:** Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles, battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services.

**Performance Analysis:**

**1. Return Comparison and Deviation:**

* **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 542.81%
* **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 84.86%
* **Deviation:** 457.95% (Relative Deviation: 38.01%)

TSLA has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 with a cumulative return more than six times higher. However, its relative deviation suggests that it has experienced periods of both extreme outperformance and underperformance compared to the index.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $219.41
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $211.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $210.21
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $215.04

The price is currently above all three moving averages, indicating a short-term bullish trend. However, the 60-day moving average is slightly higher than the current price, suggesting some potential resistance in the near future.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 60.91
* **PPO:** 0.3
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 2.39 (Positive, indicating short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected_Return:** 798.01% (This is a high expected return, but it is important to note that it is based on past performance and future performance is not guaranteed.)

Both RSI and PPO indicate that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting that the current price is fairly valued. The positive Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence supports the short-term bullish trend. However, the high expected return should be considered cautiously.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-07-24 | 0.46 | 25.50 B$ |
| 2024-04-24 | 0.37 | 21.30 B$ |
| 2023-10-23 | 0.58 | 23.35 B$ |
| 2023-07-24 | 0.85 | 24.93 B$ |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.85 | 24.93 B$ |

The most recent earnings (2024-07-24) came in below analyst expectations, which led to a decline in the stock price. However, the company's revenue remains strong and is expected to continue to grow in the future. The company's focus on expanding its production capacity and entering new markets, such as China, could contribute to future growth.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has historically outperformed the market, and its recent price movement suggests a potential short-term bullish trend.  However, the recent earnings miss and high expected return warrant caution. Investors should monitor the company's progress in expanding its production capacity, entering new markets, and developing new products.
