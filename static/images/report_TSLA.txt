**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Tesla exhibits high growth potential, as demonstrated by its cumulative return drastically outperforming the S&P 500. However, this growth comes with significant volatility, as indicated by the high MDD and the mixed news headlines. The stock price is above the average analyst target, and RSI approaching overbought territory, which suggests potential downside risk in the short-term. The combination of strong potential returns with high risk makes Tesla a potentially rewarding but inherently speculative investment. The declining EPS, and high long-term return suggest that future may be in store for the company. The long-term return suggests that if Tesla is held for a long period of time, it is projected to significantly out-perform the S&P 500.
