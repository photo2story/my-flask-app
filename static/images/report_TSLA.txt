## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla's cumulative return (849.69%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (116.17%). The difference is 733.5%, placing it at the 45.6th percentile of historical relative divergence (range: -53.2% to 1673.1%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and volatile Alpha values across different periods.  Noteworthy is the exceptionally high CAGR in 2018-2021 (1069% and 1463%), followed by substantial negative returns in 2021-2024.  The Beta, indicating market volatility sensitivity, fluctuates, suggesting varying levels of correlation with the overall market.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $292.98
* **Last Market Price:** $299.78 (a $2.32 increase from the previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $299.81
* **20-day Moving Average:** $346.40
* **60-day Moving Average:** $389.32

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase may be temporary.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 28.34  (Indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.01 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.3% (Short-term downward trend)

The recent price change reflects a small positive movement. While a price increase is observed, the negative RSI, PPO, and 20-day divergence change suggest that this might be a temporary bounce. The expected return of 815.8% over the long term (2+ years) is significantly higher than the S&P 500, reflecting the high potential, but also high risk, associated with Tesla's stock.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively consistent revenue around $25 Billion across the reported quarters, but some fluctuation in EPS (Earnings Per Share). There appears to be no clear trend in earnings over the presented periods. Further analysis would require additional data points and a more comprehensive review.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock has shown exceptional growth historically, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent performance indicates a possible downward trend.  While financial information suggests strong revenue and generally healthy margins, the recent price action and technical indicators suggest caution. The high expected long-term return is alluring but comes with substantial risk, given the historical volatility.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into earnings drivers, future projections, and macroeconomic factors, is needed to form a complete investment thesis.  The inconsistency in several key metrics necessitates further investigation to understand the underlying reasons for such fluctuations.
