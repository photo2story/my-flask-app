## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Performance Review

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return (2656.11%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (83.89%). The difference is substantial, with Tesla exhibiting a return that is 2572.2 percentage points higher than the S&P 500 at the reviewed time period.  The relative divergence of 85.0 indicates Tesla's performance lies at the 85th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence values (-65.1 and 3037.1 respectively). This is a remarkably high relative divergence, suggesting exceptionally strong performance compared to its historical range of outperformance versus the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values, especially from 2018 onwards,  indicating strong performance. However, the relatively low Beta values suggest a lower correlation with the overall market (S&P 500) than one might expect from such a high-growth stock.  This implies that Tesla's performance is driven by factors specific to the company rather than solely mirroring broader market trends.  Note that this high CAGR is only from backtesting and is not a future guarantee.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 29.0% | 52.4% | -3.0% | 0.0 | 66.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 39.0% | 68.3% | 18.0% | -0.1 | 71.5 |
| 2017-2019  | 32.0% | 68.3% | -2.0% | 0.3 | 89.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 1125.0% | 68.3% | 1094.0% | 0.2 | 757.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 1751.0% | 63.9% | 1691.0% | 0.1 | 1134.6 |
| 2020-2022  | 640.0% | 74.6% | 631.0% | 0.3 | 396.8 |
| 2021-2023  | 428.0% | 74.6% | 407.0% | 0.6 | 800.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 1214.0% | 74.6% | 1193.0% | 0.7 | 1300.8 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $284.95
* 5-day moving average: $252.13
* 20-day moving average: $253.14
* 60-day moving average: $287.34

The price is currently above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating some potential for further price consolidation or correction.  The significant daily price increase of 9.8%  suggests a recent sharp price jump, which warrants further investigation into potential news or events driving this upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* RSI: 63.11 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* PPO: 1.70 (Positive; suggesting upward momentum)
* Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change: +13.3% (Short-term upward trend)
* Expected Return (Long-Term, 2+ years): 467.3% (vs. S&P 500) – This is a high number indicating an expectation of significant outperformance. However, it's crucial to understand that this is a projected value and not a guaranteed return.  High projected returns often come with higher risk.

The recent price change of 9.8% indicates a sharp upward movement, which potentially contributes to the RSI value and might warrant further analysis for underlying reasons.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-04-23 | $0.13 | $19.34 B      |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18 B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18 B      |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46 | $25.50 B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.46 | $25.50 B      |

There appears to be a duplication of data in the table.  Assuming the duplicates are errors, revenue shows relatively consistent performance around $25 Billion except for the 2025-04-23 entry which shows significantly lower revenue. EPS shows significant fluctuation between quarters, requiring further investigation into the underlying reasons for these changes.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $19.34B | 16.31%       |
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B | 16.26%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B | 19.84%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B | 17.95%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B | 17.35%       |

Revenue shows some fluctuation, with a noticeable drop in Q1 2025. Profit margins are relatively stable, though there is some variation between quarters.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE    |
|---------|----------|--------|
| 2025-03-31 | $74.65B | 0.55%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B | 3.23%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B | 3.10%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B | 2.22%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38B | 2.16%  |

Equity is generally increasing, while ROE (Return on Equity) shows some variation, with a notable drop in Q1 2025.  This suggests that further investigation into the company's profitability and financial health is warranted.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance significantly outperforms the S&P 500, both in terms of cumulative return and long-term CAGR projections.  Technical indicators suggest a positive, though potentially volatile, short-term outlook.  However, recent earnings show some inconsistency and the Q1 2025 data raises concerns which need further investigation. The high long-term expected return should be viewed with caution, acknowledging the inherent risks associated with such a high-growth, high-volatility stock.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the underlying reasons for recent price movements and the variances in financial statements, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data in the earnings reports needs clarification.  The exceptionally high projected CAGR and expected return figures should be carefully examined, considering the risk associated with Tesla’s high volatility and dependence on factors such as market sentiment, regulatory changes, and competition.
