The cumulative return of TSLA is 1180.80%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.19%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1058.61%. This places TSLA's performance at the 64.4th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $389.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $365.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $343.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $276.89

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.97 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.06 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +7.8% (Short-term upward trend)

The RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought, potentially indicating a near-term correction.  However, the positive PPO and upward relative strength suggest continued bullish momentum. The expected return of 936.1% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 indicates significant outperformance potential, but this should be viewed with caution given the inherent volatility of such a projection. The large difference between the closing price ($389.22) and the last market price ($389.38) is negligible and does not suggest any significant sudden price movements.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Long-term projections indicate substantial outperformance potential, but high volatility is a significant risk factor.  Further research is crucial to assess the sustainability of current growth and to consider the risks involved.  The lack of information regarding analyst expectations and market reaction to the recent earnings reports is a significant gap in the analysis.  More information on broader market trends and analyst sentiment is needed for a complete picture.
