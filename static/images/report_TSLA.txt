## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**0) Overview:** Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Tesla's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 2234.60% for TSLA versus 76.19% for VOO.  The difference (2158.4%) is substantially higher than the historical range of differences (max: 3037.1, min: -65.1). The relative divergence of 71.7% indicates TSLA's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to VOO.

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals high growth and volatility.  While Beta generally indicates a higher correlation with the overall market (especially in recent years), the substantial Alpha suggests Tesla's outperformance isn't entirely explained by market movements.  The extremely high CAGR values in recent years (2018-2025) reflect exceptional growth, however, this should be viewed with caution due to the high volatility indicated by MDD (Maximum Drawdown).

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla (TSLA) has demonstrated exceptionally high growth and significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  However, this performance is characterized by high volatility, as evidenced by the Maximum Drawdown figures.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward correction, indicated by price being below key moving averages and some bearish technical indicators.  Despite this, the long-term outlook remains highly positive, based on a projected significant excess return over the S&P 500.  However,  a thorough analysis requires addressing inconsistencies in the provided earnings data and a deeper understanding of the fluctuations in profit margins and ROE. Further research into macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape, and Tesla's future product pipeline is crucial for a complete evaluation.
