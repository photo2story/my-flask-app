## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1219.53%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.40%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1099.1 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 66.7% indicates that TSLA's performance has been substantially higher than the S&P 500 historically, considering the maximum and minimum divergence levels observed.  However, this is a relative measure against past performance and not a prediction of future returns.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows highly variable alpha and beta values across different time periods,  with exceptionally high CAGR and alpha values between 2018 and 2021, followed by significant negative returns in 2021-2023.  This highlights the volatility and high risk associated with TSLA. The beta values fluctuate, indicating varying sensitivity to overall market movements.  Note that the substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth over the years.

The provided expected return of 908.5% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 is extremely high and should be viewed with caution.

Further analysis is needed to determine the drivers behind the price.

The provided data does not include any specific news or recent events within the last two days, market outlook, or analyst opinions.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has shown remarkably high growth historically, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent financial data shows some inconsistencies and variability.  The high RSI suggests an overbought condition, indicating a potential correction.  The highly volatile nature of the stock, as reflected in both the price movement and the financial statements, necessitates a cautious approach. The long-term expected return should be treated with extreme skepticism, as such projections are highly uncertain.  More information is required concerning news, market conditions, and analyst forecasts to provide a more comprehensive assessment.  The duplication in the Oct 2024 earnings data needs clarification.
