**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $479.86
* **Last Market Price:** $464.30

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $378.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $299.70

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the recent price difference between the last closing price and last market price requires further investigation of market events.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 90.01 (Overbought condition, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.718 (Positive value indicates upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +15.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 753.0% (Significantly higher than S&P 500, but this is a projected, long-term return, which is highly uncertain.)

The high RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction.  The substantial expected return is notable but should be viewed with caution, as future performance is never guaranteed.  A drop from 479.86 to 464.30 suggests a recent correction, but not a dramatic crash.

Tesla's performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term. However, recent indicators suggest the stock may be overbought, and its price could correct.  Earnings show some volatility but are generally positive.  A deeper dive into the news and analyst opinions is crucial for a more complete picture.
