**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla, Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

TSLA's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The substantial difference highlights TSLA's higher volatility and risk compared to the broader market. The relative divergence metric suggests that while exceptionally high, this outperformance is not unprecedented compared to its historical performance relative to VOO.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and substantial alpha (outperformance relative to the market) in several periods, especially 2018-2021.  However, the negative CAGR and large negative alpha in 2021-2023 show significant periods of underperformance. The high Beta values in some years indicate higher sensitivity to market movements than the S&P 500.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 34.0% | 14.2% | 5.0% | 0.0 | 66.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 46.0% | 21.0% | 28.0% | 0.3 | 71.4 |
| 2017-2019  | 48.0% | 21.0% | 18.0% | 0.9 | 89.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 1069.0% | 21.1% | 1042.0% | 0.2 | 756.6 |

| 2022-2024  | -59.0% | 36.6% | -92.0% | 0.8 | 1299.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $328.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $358.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $394.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $390.68

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The significant drop from the previous close (-$6.34 or -1.8%) indicates potential negative momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 18.29 (significantly below 30, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -2.04 (negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -12.0% (short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** 656.1%

The technical indicators point towards a bearish sentiment.  The large price drop from the previous close warrants attention, and further analysis of the underlying factors driving this decline is needed.  The high expected return, however, suggests potential for significant long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this comes with inherent higher risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18B       |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18B       |

| 2025-01-30 | $0.46 | $25.50B       |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30B       |

There appears to be some duplication of data in the provided earnings report.  A consistent upward trend in revenue is observed, though EPS shows some fluctuation. Further analysis is needed to account for the repeated entries and understand the underlying causes of these fluctuations.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B | 17.35%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B | 17.63%       |

Revenue shows relatively stable performance with a slight dip in Q1 2024.  Profit margins fluctuate but remain consistently healthy.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE    |
|---------|----------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B | 3.23%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B | 3.10%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B | 2.22%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38B | 1.75%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B | 12.66% |

Equity shows a steady increase, while ROE displays significant variation, with a notably high value in Q4 2023 and significantly lower values in subsequent quarters.  This warrants further investigation into the contributing factors.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA's performance is highly volatile, with periods of exceptional outperformance and significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While the cumulative return is exceptionally high, recent price action indicates a downtrend. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but this does not negate the potential for further downside.  The high expected return underscores the potential for long-term growth, but investors must carefully consider the associated risks.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and the fluctuation in ROE is necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health and future prospects.  The significant recent price drop warrants careful monitoring of news and developments impacting the company.
