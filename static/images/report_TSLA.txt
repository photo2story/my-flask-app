## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns for TSLA compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), indicating potential outperformance.  However, recent price action suggests a period of weakness.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this performance.


**1) Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 1072.18%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 118.49%
* **Return Difference:** 953.69%  (TSLA significantly outperformed VOO).
* **Relative Divergence:** 58.3% (This indicates TSLA's performance relative to its historical range of outperformance against VOO. It is not a measure of future outperformance.)

The historical alpha and beta values show inconsistent performance relative to the market (beta), with periods of significant outperformance (high alpha) and underperformance (negative alpha). This highlights TSLA's volatility and dependence on factors beyond broader market movements.  Note the extremely high CAGR values in some years are significantly influenced by the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 periods.  The large changes in market capitalization (Cap(B)) also reflects this volatility.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $361.62
* **Previous Close:** $374.32
* **5-day Moving Average:** $378.00
* **20-day Moving Average:** $400.02
* **60-day Moving Average:** $390.67

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-to-medium-term trend. The recent price drop of approximately $3.40, while not extreme, contributes to this bearish signal.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 21.75 (Suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a bounce, but also vulnerability to further declines.)
* **PPO:** -1.35 (Negative PPO confirms bearish momentum.)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.6% (Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the market.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 533.3% (This is a significant projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but it depends on many assumptions.  A high level of uncertainty surrounds this figure.)

The significant price drop from the previous close reinforces the bearish signals from the RSI, PPO, and moving averages. The high expected return reflects potentially high risk and should be treated with extreme caution.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows relatively consistent revenue figures across the reported quarters.  However, there is a lack of consistency in EPS figures, with variations likely reflecting seasonal factors or varying production efficiency across quarters. More detailed analysis is required to determine the underlying trends in profitability.  The duplication of data for 2025-01-30 should be investigated.  This requires confirmation that it is not an error in the reporting.


**5) Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue remains fairly stable across the past several quarters, which is positive. The profit margin shows some fluctuation but generally remains in a healthy range.  The capital position shows steady growth in Equity.  However, the Return on Equity (ROE) demonstrates significant variability. The dramatic drop in ROE in 2024 Q1 and Q2 after the unusually high 2023 Q4 results requires investigation for reasons for this change.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock shows a history of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this has come with substantial volatility. Recent price action is bearish, confirmed by technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) suggesting a short-term downward trend.  The financial information reveals stable revenue with fluctuating profit margin and ROE, meriting further examination. The projected long-term expected return is very high, but high risk is also implied.  Investors should cautiously consider this projected return given the substantial volatility of Tesla's performance and the uncertainty surrounding future earnings.  Further analysis including industry comparisons, competitive landscape evaluation, and macroeconomic factors would strengthen the analysis.
