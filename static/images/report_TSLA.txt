## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return for TSLA is 1189.17%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 112.20%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1077.0 percentage points.  The relative divergence, calculated as 65.5%, indicates TSLA's performance lies in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  While impressive, this relative performance has fluctuated significantly as shown by the maximum and minimum divergence of 1673.1 and -53.2 respectively.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows highly variable alpha and beta values across different time periods, reflecting TSLA's volatile nature.  High CAGR values are observed in certain years, accompanied by correspondingly high maximum drawdowns (MDD). Notably, the period 2018-2021 shows extremely high returns and also an extreme MDD, reflecting the high risk associated with TSLA investments.  The consistently low beta values (around 0.1) indicate low correlation to the overall market, which further highlights the high volatility of the stock.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $394.74
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $401.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $425.20
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $342.94

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a notable recent decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 38.21 (Approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce, but not confirmation of a trend reversal.)
* **PPO:** -2.34 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.0 (Short-term upward movement, but needs further confirmation)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 433.0% (This is a substantial projected return significantly exceeding the S&P 500. However, it's crucial to remember that this is a projection, and the actual return could vary significantly given Tesla's high volatility.)
* **Price Consideration:** The current price of $394.74 is below the recent moving averages.  While the RSI suggests potential for a bounce, it's not a clear indication of a substantial recovery, especially considering the negative PPO.  No significant *sudden* price jumps (up or down) are evidenced by the provided data.  However, the significant gap between the current price and the recent averages indicates a notable decline.

The high projected long-term return needs to be viewed with caution due to the inherent volatility of the stock.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in TSLA.  Further due diligence and a comprehensive understanding of the company's fundamentals and market conditions are crucial before making any investment decisions.
