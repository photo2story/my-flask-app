## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1217.15%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.47%. The difference is 1104.7%, placing it at the 67.1st percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and significant swings in performance over different time periods.  The extremely high CAGR figures for 2018-2021 are noteworthy but need to be considered alongside the substantial negative CAGR in subsequent years.  The Beta consistently increases, indicating increasing sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $403.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $399.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $424.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $346.00

The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend. The proximity to the 5-day moving average indicates recent price stability or a potential slight recovery.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 41.67 – This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.  However, it's not a conclusive buy signal on its own.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.06 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.1 – This indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 412.3% –  This represents the projected long-term (2+ years) excess return compared to the S&P 500 given a current investment. This projection should be considered with a significant degree of caution.  Such high projections are extremely unusual and should be scrutinized carefully.  The underlying assumptions driving this number are not disclosed and warrant further investigation. A 403.31 price is not significantly high to suggest extreme rapid price changes (either up or down) based on the given data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has shown exceptional historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this has been volatile.  Recent price action suggests a potential bearish trend, although the RSI indicates oversold conditions.  Earnings data shows some inconsistencies and requires further investigation to understand the drivers of EPS and ROE variance.  The projected long-term return needs rigorous validation given its exceptionally high magnitude and the lack of disclosed assumptions.  Overall, a more comprehensive fundamental analysis, considering macro-economic factors and competitive landscape, is required before forming a conclusive investment opinion.  The data provided contains inconsistencies (duplicate data entry) and potentially unreliable projections that need clarification before drawing robust conclusions.  Proceed with caution.
