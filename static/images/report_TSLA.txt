2025-12-31 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided data for Tesla (TSLA), incorporating simple numbers, analysis, and comparisons.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Tesla Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems.
*   **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 1178.06%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current Divergence: 1133.2
    *   Relative Divergence: 68.3%

**Analysis:** Tesla has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The divergence is very high, indicating Tesla's returns have far exceeded the market average. The relative divergence of 68.3% suggests that the current divergence is in the upper-middle range of its historical fluctuations relative to the S&P 500.  This means that while the outperformance is substantial, there have been periods where the difference was even larger.

**Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 2015-2017  | 39.0%    | 72.0%    | 10.0%   | -0.0    | 69.0    |
| 2016-2018  | 25.0%    | 76.2%    | 10.0%   | -0.0    | 73.8    |
| 2017-2019  | 20.0%    | 76.2%    | -3.0%   | 0.3    | 92.8    |
| 2018-2020  | 634.0%   | 82.6%    | 610.0%  | 0.2    | 782.3   |
| 2019-2021  | 837.0%   | 82.6%    | 790.0%  | 0.1    | 1171.5  |
| 2020-2022  | 302.0%   | 86.0%    | 303.0%  | 0.3    | 409.7   |
| 2021-2023  | 269.0%   | 86.0%    | 267.0%  | 0.4    | 826.4   |
| 2022-2024  | 685.0%   | 86.0%    | 665.0%  | 0.5    | 1343.1  |
| 2023-2025  | 542.0%   | 79.4%    | 475.0%  | 0.8    | 1511.3  |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows massive growth, particularly in the 2018-2021 period.  More recent periods still show very high growth, but at a reduced rate.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.  Drawdowns range from ~72% to 86% meaning investments could theoretically lose that much value during those periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is extremely high in most periods, confirming significant outperformance relative to a market benchmark.  This indicates Tesla's returns are due to company-specific factors rather than just general market movements.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally low, suggesting Tesla's price movements are not as strongly correlated with the overall market. However, it's increasing towards 1, implying a higher correlation with the market now.
*   **Cap(B):** Shows the market capitalization in billions for each period.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 454.43
*   **Previous Close:** 459.64
*   **Change:** -1.13
*   **5-day SMA:** 472.04
*   **20-day SMA:** 464.67
*   **60-day SMA:** 443.76

**Analysis:** The stock price closed lower than the previous day. The 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are above the current price, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. The 60-day SMA being below the 20-day and 5-day suggests the recent price weakness relative to the medium-term trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 54.44 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.52 (Slightly oversold)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.6 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** 432.3% (Over 2 years compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite recent price dips, the Market Risk Indicator suggests that Tesla is still considered a relatively safe investment.
*   **RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 54.44 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is slightly negative, suggesting some recent price weakness relative to its moving averages.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Hybrid Signal is suggesting buying, reinforcing the MRI opinion.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent decrease in relative divergence indicates that Tesla's performance compared to the S&P 500 has weakened slightly in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return compared to the S&P 500 is a strong bullish signal, but it's important to consider the high volatility associated with Tesla.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Cathie Wood Dumps Tesla Stock:** This indicates a large institutional investor is reducing their position, potentially signaling concerns about future growth or alternative investment opportunities.
*   **Deadlines Looming:** This suggests that there are specific events in the near future that could significantly impact Tesla's stock price.  The article should be consulted for specifics.
*   **Supplier Slashes Battery Deal:** This is a negative development, indicating potential problems in Tesla's supply chain or changing demand expectations.
*   **Analyst Remains Positive:** This provides a counterpoint to the negative news, suggesting some analysts still have confidence in Tesla's long-term prospects.
*   **SpaceX IPO Idea:** This could be a positive catalyst if it creates value for Tesla shareholders, but details are needed.
*   **Tesla Stock Dropping:** This reinforces the recent price weakness.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. There are positive analyst opinions and a potential catalyst with a SpaceX IPO idea, but significant concerns with a major investor selling, a battery deal being slashed, and general price declines. This suggests increased uncertainty.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean of 2.63)
*   **Target Price:**
    *   Average: $399.15
    *   High: $600.00
    *   Low: $120.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Hold," suggesting a neutral outlook. The wide range in target prices indicates significant disagreement among analysts regarding Tesla's future valuation. The average target price is significantly below the current price.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-10-23 | 0.43   | 28.09 B$   |
| 2025-07-24 | 0.36   | 22.50 B$   |
| 2025-04-23 | 0.13   | 19.34 B$   |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.68   | 25.18 B$   |
| 2025-01-30 | 0.68   | 25.18 B$   |

**Analysis:**  The trend is positive in terms of revenue, but EPS has been fluctuating. The most recent quarter shows strong revenue growth, but a lower EPS than previous quarters. The EPS needs further monitoring to see if costs are going up or margins are being squeezed, or if investments are bringing in increased revenue.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $28.09B      | 17.99%         |
| 2025-06-30   | $22.50B      | 17.24%         |
| 2025-03-31   | $19.34B      | 16.31%         |
| 2024-12-31   | $25.71B      | 16.26%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $25.18B      | 19.84%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity       | ROE      |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $79.97B      | 1.72%    |
| 2025-06-30   | $77.31B      | 1.52%    |
| 2025-03-31   | $74.65B      | 0.55%    |
| 2024-12-31   | $72.91B      | 3.17%    |
| 2024-09-30   | $69.93B      | 3.11%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is generally trending upward, indicating strong sales growth. Profit margins are relatively stable but show some fluctuation, with a recent improvement in the last quarter.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is consistently increasing, demonstrating healthy capital accumulation. ROE (Return on Equity) is more volatile. The most recent ROE is lower than previous periods. This suggests that while Tesla is growing its equity, it's not necessarily generating as much profit relative to its equity base as it has in the past.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Tesla has demonstrated tremendous growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500 historically. However, recent data paints a more nuanced picture.

*   **Positives:** High expected return, strong revenue growth, increasing equity, relatively high MRI, and positive Hybrid Signal.
*   **Negatives:** Recent price weakness, negative short-term divergence change, analyst consensus is "Hold" with an average target price below the current price, mixed news sentiment with a major investor selling shares and a battery deal being slashed, and fluctuating ROE and EPS.
*   **Key Considerations:** Tesla remains a high-growth, high-volatility stock.  The future direction hinges on its ability to maintain revenue growth while improving profitability. External factors (battery deals, macroeconomic conditions) and investor sentiment will continue to play a significant role.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data suggests cautious optimism. The long-term potential remains significant, but recent headwinds and mixed signals warrant careful consideration. I would recommend a buy, but in a way that uses a small amount of resources (dollar-cost averaging, and allocating only a small % of investment portfolio).
