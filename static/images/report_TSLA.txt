| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Close Price | **$445.01** | N/A |
| Previous Close | $435.80 (Change: +2.11%) | Sharp rebound/strong daily gain. |
| 5-day SMA | $438.537 | Price is above the short-term average (Positive short-term momentum). |

| 60-day SMA | $443.9421 | Price is slightly above the long-term average (Slight long-term strength). |

**Analysis:** The stock experienced a strong single-day rebound (+2.11%) and is trading above its immediate 5-day and 60-day moving averages.

### 3) Technical Indicators and Risk Assessment

| Indicator | Value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Market Risk Indicator (MRI) | **0.7** | Low Investment Recommended (Cautionary signal). |
| RSI | **33.49** | Approaching oversold conditions (typical oversold < 30), suggesting recent strong selling pressure. |
| PPO | **-1.1126** | Negative, confirming bearish momentum where the shorter-term average is below the longer-term average. |
| Recent Relative Divergence Change | **1.0 (+)** | Short-term rise (short-term rebound). |
| Expected Return (%) | **398.6** | High excess return expected relative to S&P 500 over 2+ years. |
| Hybrid Signal | cash\_0%\_Buy 100% of cash | Aggressive buy recommendation based on the model's momentum/safety analysis. |

**Analysis:** Technical indicators are mixed. The RSI (33.49) and PPO (-1.11) suggest bearish momentum and that the stock has been recently sold off. However, the system registers a short-term rebound (+1.0 divergence change) and issues an aggressive buy signal. The high Beta (2.3) risk is reflected in the cautious MRI score (0.7), placing the stock in the "Low Investment" category despite its high potential Expected Return (398.6%).

### 6) Financial Information

#### Revenue and Profitability

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-09-30 | $28.09B | 17.99% |
| 2025-06-30 | $22.50B | 17.24% |
| 2025-03-31 | $19.34B | 16.31% |
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B | 16.26% |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B | 19.84% |

**Analysis:** Revenue growth has been extremely strong sequentially in 2025, recovering from the Q1 dip. Profit margins have also shown sequential improvement throughout 2025, rising from 16.31% to 17.99%, though still below the level seen in Q3 2024 (19.84%).

#### Capital and Profitability

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-09-30 | $79.97B | 1.72% |
| 2025-06-30 | $77.31B | 1.52% |
| 2025-03-31 | $74.65B | 0.55% |
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B | 3.17% |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B | 3.11% |

**Analysis:** Total Equity has consistently increased, reaching $79.97B by Q3 2025. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) has dropped significantly year-over-year. ROE peaked at over 3.1% in late 2024 but fell drastically to 0.55% in Q1 2025 during the operational slowdown, and despite the recovery in earnings, Q3 2025 ROE remains low at 1.72%. This indicates that while the capital base is growing, the company’s ability to generate profit relative to its equity has substantially decreased.

### 7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)

TSLA has delivered exceptional long-term cumulative returns (1049.98%), showing massive historical Alpha, but is currently characterized by extremely high volatility, evidenced by a Beta of 2.3 and an MDD of 57.1% in the 2023-2025 period.

**Technical and Risk Profile:** The stock recently displayed a strong daily rebound (+2.11%) but is technically weak with RSI approaching oversold territory (33.49) and a negative PPO, supporting an intermediate bearish trend (below 20-day SMA). The Market Risk Indicator (MRI 0.7) suggests caution ("Low Investment").

**Fundamental Performance:** After facing a sharp operational dip in Q1 2025, TSLA demonstrated a strong sequential recovery in both revenue and profit margins throughout Q2 and Q3 2025. However, a major concern is the **deterioration of capital efficiency**, with ROE falling substantially from over 3% (late 2024) to 1.72% (Q3 2025), indicating that the growing equity base is generating weaker relative returns.

**Sentiment:** Analysts maintain a neutral "Hold" rating, with the consensus target price below the current market price, suggesting caution regarding immediate upside potential despite the recent positive stock movement.
