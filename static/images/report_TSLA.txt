* **20-Day Moving Average:** $255.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $293.82

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase (Last-market data shows a $4.6 increase) might indicate a short-term bounce, but sustained upward movement needs confirmation.

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative strength suggests a bearish short-term outlook. However, the high long-term expected return warrants further consideration. The recent price increase of $4.6 warrants monitoring for signs of a sustained upward trend or potential short-lived upward bounce.

The fluctuating profitability and ROE, as shown in recent financial data, warrant closer examination.
