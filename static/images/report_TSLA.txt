## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The provided data shows a cumulative return of 1255.69% for TSLA, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1139.26%. This places TSLA's performance in the 69.1st percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, indicating a substantially higher return compared to the benchmark index.  However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The high volatility of TSLA is evident in the large swings in its CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values over the years presented.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $415.11
* **Last Market Price:** $413.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $407.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $420.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $355.62

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average highlights the recent price volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.76 – Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.01 –  Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +3.8 – Suggests a recent short-term upward trend.

The discrepancy between the RSI and PPO could indicate a potential short-term reversal.  The positive relative divergence supports this notion. However, the -1.01 PPO still suggests cautiousness.

Considering the Last-market price of $413.36 is relatively close to the closing price, no significant price jumps (rapid increase or decrease) are immediately apparent from this limited data.  The expected return of 387.5% is extremely high and likely unrealistic as a guaranteed figure, especially considering this is a projection against the S&P 500 over a long-term period (2+ years).   This projection should be taken with considerable skepticism, given Tesla's high volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-10-23 | $0.72   | $0.58        | +$0.14      |

| 2023-10-18 | $0.66   | $0.72        | -$0.06      |

Tesla has shown mixed results in recent earnings, exceeding expectations in some quarters and falling short in others.  A consistent trend is difficult to establish based on this limited data. Further analysis is needed for a definitive conclusion.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18       | 19.84%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50       | 17.95%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30       | 17.35%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17       | 17.63%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $23.35       | 17.89%        |

Revenue has remained relatively stable, though showing some fluctuation. Profit margins show some variability, but generally remain healthy.  The significant jump in profit margin in Q3 2024 warrants further investigation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93      | 3.10    |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47      | 2.22    |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38      | 1.75    |
| 2023-12-31 | $62.63      | 12.66   |
| 2023-09-30 | $53.47      | 3.47    |

Equity is steadily increasing. ROE shows significant variability, with a notably high value in Q4 2023.  This fluctuation requires deeper analysis to determine the underlying drivers.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, but this comes with considerable volatility.  Recent price movements show some bearish short-term signs, while technical indicators present a mixed picture.  Earnings have been inconsistent, and financial data reveals fluctuations in both profitability and ROE.  The extremely high projected long-term return needs to be considered with extreme caution.  Investors should carefully consider Tesla's high risk profile alongside its significant growth potential before making any investment decisions.  Further in-depth analysis is required to reach a more definitive conclusion.
