## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Summary:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1292.88%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1174.5%, placing it at the 71.1th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates a substantially higher return than the benchmark index over the period considered.  The provided alpha values consistently suggest outperformance relative to the market, although the high volatility (reflected in the Beta and MDD â€“ Maximum Drawdown) should be noted.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $426.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $413.64
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $417.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $359.06

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  However, it is significantly above the 60-day moving average, which might indicate a potential pullback.  The recent price increase of $3.06 (from $413.82) signifies a short-term upward trend but doesn't fully explain the large difference between the current price and the 60 day average. Further investigation is needed to determine if this is sustainable.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.04 (Slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, but leaning toward oversold).
* **PPO:** -0.66 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum).
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +5.6 (Positive value indicates short-term upward momentum).
* **Expected Return:** 365.2% (This is a remarkably high expected return and needs to be considered within the context of the significant volatility of the TSLA stock.  It should not be taken as a guaranteed outcome, but a potential outcome given past performance, especially with long-term investment).

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO values, contrasted with the positive relative divergence, suggest some conflicting signals. The significant recent price change ($3.06) contributes to the short-term upward trend, but the long-term outlook needs more comprehensive analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA shows exceptionally high returns relative to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility.  Recent price movements suggest short-term upward momentum, but longer-term trends are less clear, with signals from technical indicators being somewhat mixed.  Earnings data is somewhat inconsistent and requires more information. While financial information shows generally healthy revenue and profit margins, ROE's volatility raises concerns. The exceptionally high projected return needs careful consideration given the inherent risk associated with TSLA.  Further in-depth analysis including risk assessment is required before making any investment decisions.  The contradictory indicators and high volatility necessitate cautious interpretation of the data.
