2024-12-19 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1479.01%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.85%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1358.17%.  The relative divergence of 81.7% indicates that TSLA's performance is substantially higher than the S&P 500 over the period considered, placing it in the top 81.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  Note that this is a relative measure, not an absolute measure of outperformance.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slightly positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market after accounting for risk) though this should be considered alongside other factors. The beta values, however, are significantly higher than 1 in most periods, indicating higher volatility compared to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $479.86
* **Last Market Price:** $435.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $444.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $378.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $299.70

The recent price of $435.49 is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend, but above the 60-day average, indicative of a longer-term upward trend. The significant gap between the current price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages indicates the recent volatility of the stock price.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 90.01 – This extremely high RSI suggests the stock is overbought, indicating a potential short-term correction or pullback.
* **PPO:** 1.718 – A positive PPO suggests upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +15.0 –  Indicates a recent period of upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 753.0% – This represents a significant projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, assuming the current trend continues. However, this is a projection, not a guaranteed return.
* **Last Market Price vs Closing Price:** The Last Market Price being lower than the closing price suggests that there has been a recent significant price increase, or there was a considerable gap between the most recent transaction price and the day's closing price.  Further investigation of market activity around the closing time is needed for a complete understanding of this discrepancy. A sharp price increase is implied, but to confirm whether it was a "rapid surge" requires detailed intraday data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The most recent quarter (2024-10-24) shows a slight decrease in revenue compared to the previous quarter (2024-07-24) but an increase in EPS.  Revenue has generally been fluctuating and EPS is trending upwards, though with some quarter-to-quarter variability. There is not enough information here to evaluate whether these numbers beat or missed expectations.  More context and comparative data is required.  There is a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24 in the provided data.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue has been relatively stable in recent quarters, with a slight decrease in Q1 2024 before a rebound in Q2.  Overall revenue is very strong.

* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have been generally consistent, fluctuating slightly between 17% and 20%, indicating good profitability.  The significant drop in Q4 2023 warrants further investigation.

* **Equity & ROE:** Equity has steadily increased, suggesting a healthy financial position.  The ROE shows significant fluctuation, with a large spike in Q4 2023 and a subsequent decline.  This volatility requires deeper examination of the contributing factors.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  Providing recent news articles and analyst opinions on Tesla would greatly enhance the report.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows extremely strong performance relative to the S&P 500, indicated by both its cumulative return and relative divergence. However, this high performance comes with high volatility.  Technical indicators suggest an overbought condition (RSI), but positive momentum (PPO). Recent earnings show stable revenue and fluctuating but generally increasing EPS.  Financial health looks good, although there is some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation in key profitability metrics. The significant projected future returns should be treated cautiously, as this is based on historical trends that may not continue.  Further investigation of market conditions, recent news events, and analyst opinions are needed for a more complete picture.  The discrepancy between the closing price and the last market price requires clarification and further investigation.
