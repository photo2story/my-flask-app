**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $272.04
* **Previous Close:** $284.65
* **Change:** -$4.43 (a significant single-day drop)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $284.48
* **20-day Moving Average:** $334.82
* **60-day Moving Average:** $386.79

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The large single-day drop warrants further investigation into the underlying cause.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 30.70 (Below 30 suggests the stock is oversold)
* **PPO:** -2.06 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.7% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** 944.4% (This is a very high projected return and should be treated with caution.  Long-term investing does not guarantee this outcome.)

The significant negative change in price (-$4.43) indicates a substantial price drop, which could be related to negative news or market sentiment.  Given the combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative divergence, the short-term outlook appears bearish.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entries for Jan 30, 2025).  Assuming the unique entries are correct, revenue remains relatively stable, but EPS varies. Further analysis requires more complete and consistent data.

| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows some fluctuation in revenue and profitability. Profit margins show relative stability but are not exceptionally high.  ROE is extremely high in Q4 2023, significantly dropping in subsequent quarters.  Further investigation is needed to understand this sharp decline.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue      | Profit Margin |

| 2023-12-31  | $62.63B       | 12.66%        |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's past performance has been highly volatile, showing periods of exceptional growth interspersed with significant declines. While the cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500, this doesn't guarantee future success.  The current market indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend. The projected long-term return is exceptionally high and should be viewed with significant skepticism.  Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons for recent price drops and the fluctuation in key financial metrics.  A thorough due diligence process considering various factors, including market conditions and company-specific news, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data provided is insufficient for a fully comprehensive analysis; additional information is necessary for a more robust conclusion.
