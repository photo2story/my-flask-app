## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:** Tesla, an electric vehicle and clean energy company, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  However, recent performance shows signs of weakness, requiring a closer examination of its financial health and market trends.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Tesla (TSLA) exhibited a cumulative return of 994.97%, far exceeding the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 118.31%. The divergence is substantial (876.7 points), placing it at the 53.9th percentile of its historical range (max: 1673.1, min: -53.2).  This highlights TSLA's significant outperformance but also its high volatility relative to the broader market.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data reveals periods of exceptionally high growth (e.g., 1069% and 1463% in 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 respectively), punctuated by significant drawdowns (-456% in 2021-2023). The alpha values show periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (beta), indicating periods of both market-driven and company-specific returns. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows significant growth over the years.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights significant risk associated with TSLA investment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $337.8
* **Previous Close:** $354.4
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $352.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $371.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $392.79

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent significant price drop (-4.68%) indicates a potential market correction or negative sentiment toward the stock.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.97 – Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity but also the possibility of further decline.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.56 – Shows a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -3.2 – Confirms a short-term downtrend.

The large negative change in price (-4.68%) warrants attention. While it could be a buying opportunity in the long term, it signifies a notable short-term downturn.  The expected return of 611.8% over a long-term (2+ years) horizon relative to the S&P 500 is a significant projection but should be viewed with caution due to the inherent volatility of TSLA.
