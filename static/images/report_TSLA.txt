**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  However, recent performance indicates a potential downturn.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 971.41
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 117.28
* **Return Difference:** 854.13  This indicates TSLA significantly outperformed VOO.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data reveals highly volatile performance with fluctuating alpha and beta values.  High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values are offset by significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  The sharp increase in alpha in 2018-2021 is noteworthy, indicating significant outperformance during that period. However, subsequent years display negative returns and high MDD, suggesting substantial risk. Market capitalization also displays significant fluctuation over time.

* **Change:** -$7.27 (a 2.15% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $347.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $367.21

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price drop is notable.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** -0.715 (negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.4% (indicates a recent short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 638.7% (significantly higher than S&P 500)

The recent price drop of $7.27 warrants attention.  While the oversold RSI might indicate a potential bounce, the negative PPO and downward trend suggest caution.  The high expected return is based on historical outperformance but carries significant risk.
