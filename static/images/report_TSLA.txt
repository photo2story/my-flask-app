**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows significantly higher returns for TSLA compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  However, the high volatility and potentially unsustainable growth rates warrant further investigation.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 2656.73%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 88.48%
* **Return Difference:** 2568.25%
* **Relative Divergence:** 84.9% (This indicates TSLA's performance is in the top 84.9% percentile relative to its historical performance compared to VOO, based on the provided min/max range. It does *not* mean it outperformed VOO by 84.9%).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $287.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $285.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $257.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $278.49

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term correction within a longer-term trend.  The significant difference between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages implies recent volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 65.70 (Approaching overbought territory; above 70 is generally considered overbought)
* **PPO:** 2.15 (Positive value indicates upward momentum, but the magnitude needs further context)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 470.4% (Significantly higher than the S&P 500, but this projection requires careful consideration due to its high volatility and inherent uncertainty)

The combination of RSI approaching overbought territory and negative relative divergence change suggests a potential short-term price correction might be likely.  The high expected return reflects the historical outperformance but should not be viewed as a guaranteed outcome.

**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available. This is a significant limitation in assessing the company's overall financial health and profitability. Further data is needed for a comprehensive analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla has shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, as evidenced by a significantly higher cumulative return and relative divergence.  However, this performance has been characterized by high volatility, as indicated by the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) in the provided CAGR data and the recent price movement analysis. The high expected return should be treated with caution; the projection is subject to significant uncertainty, especially considering the current market conditions and the company's growth trajectory. The limited financial data and inconsistent earnings report entries limit the depth of this analysis.  Before making any investment decisions, a more thorough analysis, including a detailed examination of financial statements, industry comparisons, and a comprehensive risk assessment, is crucial.
