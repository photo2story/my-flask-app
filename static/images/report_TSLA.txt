2024-12-18 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1423.61%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.78%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1301.83%. The relative divergence of 78.5% indicates that TSLA's performance is in the upper 78.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range.  This shows a substantial outperformance historically.  However, this is a historical comparison and doesn't predict future performance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, particularly in the 2018-2021 period, indicating strong growth. However, the significant negative CAGR in 2021-2023 highlights substantial volatility. The relatively low beta (around 0.1) suggests relatively low correlation with the overall market, although the high market cap values suggest that it might not reflect the full picture.   It's important to note that high alpha values do not necessarily signify future success and should be viewed in context of other metrics.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $463.02
* **Last Market Price:** $475.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $428.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $371.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $295.87

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  However, the significant gap between the 5-day and 60-day moving averages indicates considerable price volatility. The jump to $475.49 from the closing price implies a substantial recent positive movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 88.76 – This extremely high RSI indicates the stock is significantly overbought and potentially prone to a correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.42 – A positive PPO suggests upward momentum, but the value itself isn't highly informative without additional context.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +13.9 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 781.1% – This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). However, such high projections should be treated with significant caution.  The actual return is highly uncertain and depends on many factors beyond this analysis.  This high expected return is consistent with the historical overperformance shown above, but again, past performance is not indicative of future results.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions to complete this analysis.  This data was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock shows a history of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this is based on past performance, which is not a guarantee of future success.  Current indicators suggest significant short-term upward momentum, but the high RSI indicates the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction. Earnings are showing some fluctuations, and profitability indicators show variability.  The high expected return is highly speculative, requiring more thorough fundamental analysis and considering current market conditions and external factors.  More information on recent news and analyst opinions would provide a more comprehensive picture.  The extreme volatility warrants close monitoring.  Due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions.
