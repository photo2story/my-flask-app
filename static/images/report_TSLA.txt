## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  As of the last data point, TSLA's cumulative return is 1159.86%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 127.58%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1032.28%.  The relative divergence of 59.77% indicates that TSLA's performance is in the upper percentiles of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this is relative to its own historical volatility against the S&P 500, not an absolute measure of outperformance.  The maximum divergence observed historically was 1763.87%, and the minimum was -54.48%.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high Alpha values (significantly outperforming the market)  across most periods, indicating strong stock-specific performance.  However, the Beta is consistently above 1, suggesting higher volatility than the S&P 500. Note the significant drop in CAGR and a negative value in the 2022-2024 period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $352.56 (Last market: $358.0)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $343.79
* **20-day Moving Average:** $301.95
* **60-day Moving Average:** $256.98

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The difference between the last market price ($358.0) and the closing price ($352.56) suggests a minor price correction.  However, it is important to note that this represents just one day of movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 76.95 (Overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.75 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +15.72% (Indicates recent short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 102.27% (This represents a potential excess return over the S&P 500 with long-term, consistent investment, but carries inherent uncertainty.)

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought, potentially indicating a short-term correction.  However, the positive PPO and strong recent relative divergence suggest continued bullish momentum.  The high expected return is a long term projection and should be viewed with caution.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS.  While revenue generally remains strong, profit margins have seen some variability.  For example, Q3 2024's earnings per share (EPS) of $0.68 exceeded the previous quarter's $0.46 but was slightly lower than the $0.58 reported in Q4 2023.  Revenue similarly fluctuated. A comparison with analyst expectations for the most recent quarter's earnings would provide a more complete picture.


**5. Revenue and Profitability:**

The provided data reveals some volatility in revenue and profit margins, even amidst high overall revenue.  ROE has also fluctuated significantly, reaching a high of 12.66% in Q4 2023, but declining afterwards. This should be investigated further for underlying causes.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Tesla's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, showing strong alpha.  However, this has come with increased volatility (high beta). Recent price action shows short-term upward momentum but technical indicators (high RSI) suggest potential overbought conditions.  Earnings data show fluctuating but generally strong revenue figures.  A deeper analysis, including comparison with analyst expectations, and examining news concerning recent earnings releases, is necessary for a complete assessment. The high expected return over the long-term should be considered carefully in the context of potential volatility.
