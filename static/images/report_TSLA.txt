## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Performance Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Tesla, Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows a significantly higher cumulative return for TSLA compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison:**

* **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 1047.84%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 122.48%
* **Return Difference:** 925.4%  This indicates a substantial outperformance of TSLA compared to the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 56.7% places it in the upper percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500, but this doesn't guarantee future performance.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance with significant year-to-year variations.  The Beta values are consistently near zero, suggesting a low correlation with the overall market.  However, the very high alpha values in certain years (especially 2018-2021) are noteworthy but not necessarily sustainable.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $346.18
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $380.95

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish trend in the short term.

* **RSI:** 35.03  (Below 30 suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.99 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.5 (Slight short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 558.9% (This extremely high figure requires further context and justification, especially given the volatility shown in the CAGR data)

The RSI indicates the stock is potentially oversold, while the PPO confirms bearish momentum.  The positive relative divergence suggests a short-term upward correction might be underway, but this should be viewed cautiously.  The extremely high expected return needs significant qualification and context to be considered reliable.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18 B       |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18 B       |

| 2025-01-30 | $0.46 | $25.50 B       |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30 B       |

The data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  More detailed analysis, including a comparison to previous quarters and industry benchmarks, is required for a comprehensive assessment.  Duplicate entries for Jan 30, 2025 need clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits the ability to conduct a thorough financial analysis.  This missing data is a major obstacle to a complete assessment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has shown extraordinary historical returns compared to the S&P 500.  However, its performance has been highly volatile, as evidenced by the CAGR and MDD figures.  Current technical indicators suggest a possible short-term upward correction, but the overall trend appears bearish.  The lack of comprehensive financial data hinders a robust evaluation.  The exceptionally high expected return requires detailed justification and should be treated with skepticism given the other data.  More information, especially complete financial statements, is necessary for a more informed investment decision.  The high volatility implies a significant risk profile.
