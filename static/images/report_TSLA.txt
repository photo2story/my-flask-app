## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative return between TSLA and VOO as of the last data point is 1086.2 percentage points. This places the stock's relative performance at the 66th percentile of its historical range (based on the provided maximum and minimum deviations).  While this shows strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future results.  The high volatility reflected in the CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures further supports this caution.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $400.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $398.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $404.98
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $379.92

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend. The recent price increase (from $389.1 to $400.28) is significant, indicating a potential short-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.13 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.95 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -2.2% (Indicates a recent short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 421.8% (This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon (2+ years).  This is a highly significant figure and should be viewed with caution given the inherent uncertainties in long-term projections).

The recent price increase should be considered within the context of the generally negative PPO and the slightly bearish relative strength indicator. The high expected return reflects the potential but highly uncertain long-term growth of the company.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over various periods, reflecting strong growth potential. However,  high volatility and considerable risk are also evident.  Recent price action suggests potential short-term bearishness, counterbalanced by longer-term positive trends.  Financial data shows generally positive revenue and relatively stable profit margins, though some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations exist.  The high projected long-term return warrants caution and thorough due diligence before any investment decision. The significant variations in ROE and the duplicated earnings data points require further investigation and clarification.  Investors should carefully consider the company's growth prospects, competitive landscape, and inherent risks before investing.
