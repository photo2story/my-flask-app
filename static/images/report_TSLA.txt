## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Overview:**

Tesla, Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  This report analyzes Tesla's performance based on provided financial and market data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla's cumulative return (1036.88%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.05%). The difference is 916.8%, placing it at the 56.2nd percentile of the historical range of divergence (max: 1673.1, min: -53.2).  This indicates strong relative performance compared to the broader market, although this relative performance is subject to substantial fluctuations as evidenced by the provided data.  Alpha and Beta values fluctuate significantly, suggesting high volatility and periods of both outperformance and underperformance compared to the market. Note that a high alpha doesn't automatically translate into better investment, and it's important to consider beta and market risk as well.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows substantial fluctuations in both Alpha and Beta across the years.  High Alpha values (e.g., 1.1 in 2023-2025) suggest periods of significant outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  However, the negative CAGR values (-456.0% in 2021-2023 and -59.0% in 2022-2024)  highlight the considerable risk involved in Tesla stock. The high volatility necessitates a careful risk assessment before investment.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth throughout the period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $350.73
* **Previous Close:** $361.62
* **Change:** -$3.01 (Downward trend)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $371.41
* **20-day Moving Average:** $397.82
* **60-day Moving Average:** $390.68

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 20.25 (Indicates oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a bounce but not a guaranteed reversal)
* **PPO:** -1.59 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -6.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 570.4% (This represents substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, implying significant potential gains under a long-term investment horizon, but this requires considering the high volatility inherent in Tesla's stock performance.)  The large price drop indicated by the 'Last-market' data is a significant negative factor and needs to be taken into account when considering this high projected return.  Significant risk is present.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively consistent revenue figures around $25 billion, but EPS is varied and may reflect seasonal or other factors. Further investigation is needed for a complete understanding of earning trends.

| 2023-12-31  | $62.63B    | 12.66% |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Tesla's stock exhibits high growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term based on the provided data. However, it also carries substantial risk, as evidenced by periods of significant price drops and high volatility. While the long-term expected return is impressive, the recent downward trend, oversold RSI, and negative PPO signal caution. A thorough understanding of the company's fundamentals, alongside careful risk management strategies, is crucial before investing in Tesla.  The significant drop in recent price and the drop in the ROE in the last year are points of concern that require further investigation.  Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance before investing in TSLA given the high volatility.
