## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 1174.5%.  This places TSLA's performance at the 71.1th percentile relative to its historical performance compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence values. The provided alpha values consistently show that Tesla has outperformed the market (positive alpha), although the magnitude fluctuates greatly year-over-year.  The beta consistently remains around 0.1, indicating very low correlation to the market as a whole. This high divergence indicates that TSLA's performance has been far more volatile and significantly outpaced the S&P 500 in the examined period, although recent years (2021-2024) show dramatic negative CAGR.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $426.50
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $413.64
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $417.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $359.06

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages might indicate a slight consolidation phase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.04  (Below 50, suggesting the stock might be slightly oversold.)
* **PPO:** -0.66 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.6% (Positive, short-term upward movement.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 365.2% (This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term. This should be viewed with significant skepticism as it represents an extraordinarily high return compared to historical averages.)

The current price of $426.50 reflects a recent increase from the moving averages, but given the low RSI and negative PPO, combined with historically high volatility, significant short term price fluctuations remain possible.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA exhibits exceptionally high growth compared to the S&P 500, but with significant volatility.  While recent price action shows signs of short-term upward momentum, the negative PPO and relatively low RSI suggest caution.  The extremely high projected long-term return requires rigorous scrutiny given its unrealistic magnitude.  Further analysis of the inconsistent earnings data and  ROE is critical for a complete assessment.  The extremely high volatility and low correlation with the market make TSLA a high-risk, high-reward investment.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing.
