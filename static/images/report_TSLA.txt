**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 1089.58% for TSLA compared to 128.86% for the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 960.7%, placing it at the 55.8th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (maximum difference: 1763.9%, minimum difference: -54.5%).  This signifies a significantly higher return than the S&P 500 over the period considered.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently high Beta (generally above 3), indicating TSLA's price movements are significantly more volatile than the overall market.  The Alpha is also largely positive, suggesting that TSLA has historically outperformed the market, especially between 2018 and 2021. However, recent years (2021-2024) show declining CAGR and negative returns, highlighting market volatility.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values consistently exceeding 30% further emphasize the significant risk associated with TSLA investment.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 12.4% | 34.2% | 0.9%  | 3.1   | 66.6   |
| 2016-2018  | 14.2% | 32.3% | 4.4%  | 3.5   | 71.2   |
| 2017-2019  | 24.5% | 47.8% | 9.6%  | 3.8   | 89.5   |
| 2018-2020  | 122.5%| 60.4% | 108.7%| 2.9   | 755.1  |
| 2019-2021  | 157.3%| 60.4% | 131.3%| 3.0   | 1000.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 62.5% | 73.1% | 55.2% | 2.8   | 395.4  |
| 2021-2023  | 0.7%  | 73.3% | -9.8% | 3.4   | 797.6  |
| 2022-2024  | -5.9% | 72.7% | -15.3%| 3.5   | 1000.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $332.89 (Last Market: $332.79)
* 5-Day Moving Average: $340.38
* 20-Day Moving Average: $313.45
* 60-Day Moving Average: $263.07

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it is significantly above its 60-day moving average.  This indicates potential support at the 60-day MA. The slight difference between the closing price and last market price suggests minimal intraday volatility on the last trading day.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 60.63 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* PPO: -0.55 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* 20-Day Relative Strength Change: +14.1% (Indicates recent short-term upward momentum)

Given the recent price of $332.79 is not significantly different from the closing price, no sudden surge or drop is apparent from this data alone. The positive relative strength change, however, contradicts the negative PPO and suggests a conflicting short term signal.  The high expected return of 1152.5% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is substantial and highlights the potential for significant gains but also increased risk.
