## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1316.95%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%.  The difference in cumulative return between TSLA and VOO is 1199.4%, placing it at the 72.5th percentile of its historical range of divergence (max: 1673.3%, min: -53.1%).  This indicates TSLA's performance has been considerably higher than the S&P 500 over the measured period.  The provided Alpha values consistently show a positive outperformance relative to the market (Beta), though the magnitude of the alpha fluctuates significantly from period to period. Beta values are high and volatile showing a significant market sensitivity, especially for 2018-2021 periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $430.60
* **Last Market Price:** $462.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $441.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $396.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $311.40

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term bullish momentum. However, it's significantly above the 60-day moving average which indicates a potential price correction if the positive trend isn't sustained. The difference between the Last Market Price ($462.28) and the Closing Price suggests a recent price drop, likely driving the change in the relative strength index (RSI).

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 68.84 – Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.64 – Shows negative momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence:** -6.0% - Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 857.5% - This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  However, this projection needs careful consideration given the historical volatility of TSLA. The large jump in the last market price versus the closing price ($462.28 vs $430.60) suggests a potential recent, quick upward price movement.  This should be examined further for underlying causes.

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-24).  Focusing only on the unique data points:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates, with a peak in Q2 2024 and slight decreases following.  No clear consistent upward trend is apparent over this short timeframe.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**  This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which is not provided in the given data.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock has historically shown substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, the recent data shows mixed signals. While the long-term expected return is high, short-term indicators like RSI and PPO suggest potential correction.  The recent price movement shows volatility, and the earnings data reveals fluctuations in both revenue and EPS without a clear upward trend.  The high beta value consistently shows a high level of market risk, making the stock highly sensitive to overall market shifts.  More data, particularly on recent news and analyst opinions, is needed for a comprehensive analysis.  The provided financial information highlights volatility in key metrics, and further investigation is required to understand the underlying drivers of these fluctuations.  A significant portion of analysis is impossible with the missing context.
