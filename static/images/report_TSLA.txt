**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  TSLA's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by 2028.03 percentage points.  The provided data shows that while the relative divergence is high, indicating superior performance in the past, it doesn't guarantee continued outperformance.  The maximum historical divergence reached 3037.1%, while the minimum was -65.1%. The current level sits at 67.5% on the relative scale.

The Alpha and Beta analysis indicates high growth with considerable volatility. Note that the significantly higher CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in recent years (2018-2025) highlight Tesla's exceptional growth but also its increased risk compared to the earlier years. The Beta is also consistently increasing, indicating a stronger correlation with the overall market.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth over the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $227.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $243.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $257.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $296.63

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The significant negative change from the previous close (-5.75) indicates a recent sharp drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.36 (Slightly below oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound but not confirming it)
* **PPO:** -0.1373 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -7.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years):** 762.8% (Significant potential excess return over the S&P 500, but highly speculative and dependent on numerous factors)

The price drop of -5.75 from the previous close (241.37 to 227.5) is a notable recent development which highlights risk.  Although the Expected Return is high, investors should be aware of this significant downward price movement and the overall medium risk assessment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18B      |

| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30B      |

There's a noticeable duplication of data points in the earnings report.  The data suggests relatively stable revenue around $25B, but EPS shows some fluctuation.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this is due to data error or genuine market fluctuation.

| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B   | 17.35%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B   | 17.63%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B   | 12.66% |

Equity is steadily increasing, but ROE shows a significant drop from Q4 2023 to subsequent quarters, requiring further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla has shown exceptional historical growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the recent price drop and the bearish technical indicators (PPO, RSI) suggest caution.  The medium risk assessment (MRI) supports this. While the long-term expected return is high, it's crucial to remember that this is a projection based on past performance and doesn't guarantee future returns. The company's financial data shows stable revenue but fluctuating profitability and ROE.  Before making any investment decision, a more in-depth analysis of the reasons behind the recent price drop and the decline in ROE, and potentially a review of the duplicate data in the earnings report, is crucial.  The high potential reward comes with significant risk, as evidenced by historical volatility.
