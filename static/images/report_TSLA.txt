**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high growth. However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.

Inconsistent earnings data and fluctuating ROE require further analysis and clarification before drawing definitive conclusions.  The high volatility inherent in TSLA requires a risk-tolerant investment strategy.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent risks associated with this high-growth, high-volatility stock.  Further investigation into the data discrepancies is crucial.
