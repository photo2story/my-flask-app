*   **Negative Factors:** High volatility (MDD), approaching overbought RSI, analyst "Hold" consensus, lower delivery estimates, EPS fluctuation, lower ROE.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the mixed signals, a neutral or cautious approach may be warranted. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing. Watch upcoming delivery numbers and profitability trends closely.
