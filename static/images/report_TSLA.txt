## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is 1228.90%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 115.09%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1113.8%, placing it at the 67.6th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (max 1673.1%, min -53.2%).  This indicates TSLA's substantial outperformance relative to the broader market, although this outperformance is less extreme than in past periods.  The provided Alpha values consistently remain around 0.1, suggesting a modest outperformance compared to the market benchmark beyond the beta.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show extremely high growth in some periods (e.g., 1069% and 1463%), followed by significant declines, emphasizing the volatility inherent in TSLA's stock.  The high beta values (especially in the years with high CAGR) also confirm this high volatility and sensitivity to broader market movements. The significant drop in CAGR in the latest periods (-456% and -59%) highlights recent market headwinds.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $403.84
* **Last Market Price:** $379.73
* **5-day Moving Average:** $433.86
* **20-day Moving Average:** $418.91
* **60-day Moving Average:** $326.56

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential longer-term support. The Last Market Price indicates a recent drop, highlighting the need to consider recent price volatility and market sentiment.  The significant gap between the current price and the 5-day moving average suggests a recent price decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.57 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -2.03 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** -4.9% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 408.8% (This figure needs clarification.  Is this the expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term?  What is the methodology behind this projection?)

The Last Market price of $379.73 is considerably lower than the closing price, suggesting a recent sharp downturn.  This requires caution, especially in combination with the negative PPO. The high projected long-term expected return (408.8%) requires justification and a thorough explanation of the methodology used to derive this figure.
