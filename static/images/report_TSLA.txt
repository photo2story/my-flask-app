**Analysis:**
The table illustrates TSLA's transition from a high-growth stock with moderate volatility (Beta 1.3, CAGR 9%-13% pre-2018) to a hyper-growth powerhouse (CAGR consistently over 200% post-2020) characterized by **extreme risk**.

1.  **Explosive Growth:** The period 2018-2021 shows phenomenal returns (up to 759% CAGR) and massive Alpha, reflecting the stock's parabolic rise and market dominance.
2.  **Increasing Volatility:** Beta has steadily increased from 1.3 to **2.3** in the latest period, indicating the stock is more than twice as volatile as the overall market.
3.  **Maximum Drawdown (MDD) Risk:** MDD has significantly increased, reaching a high of **57.1%** in the 2023-2025 period. This confirms that while the potential returns (CAGR) remain high, the depth of potential losses has also grown substantially.

1.  **Short-Term Rebound:** Multiple articles noted the stock's recent gains, indicating a short-term break for investors ("Tesla Stock Rose. Investors Finally Caught a Break.").
2.  **Fundamental Concerns:** Significant concerns persist regarding valuation and operations ("The Math Doesn’t Add Up Anymore," "Berlin Gigafactory at Risk?"), suggesting deep-seated issues that outweigh recent price movements.
3.  **Mixed Analyst Views:** While some outlets report GLJ Research raising their price target (PT), the analyst simultaneously *maintained a Sell rating* ($25.28 PT), highlighting extreme skepticism from specific firms regarding future valuation.

#### Analyst Consensus

### 6) Financial Information Analysis

#### Revenue and Profitability

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-09-30 | $28.09B | 17.99% |
| 2025-06-30 | $22.50B | 17.24% |
| 2025-03-31 | $19.34B | 16.31% |
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B | 16.26% |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B | 19.84% |

**Analysis:**
Revenue has shown excellent sequential growth throughout 2025, culminating in the highest reported figure of $28.09B. Profit margins have also shown sequential improvement in 2025, rising from 16.31% to 17.99%, suggesting improving operational efficiency and cost management.

#### Capital and Profitability (ROE)

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-09-30 | $79.97B | 1.72% |
| 2025-06-30 | $77.31B | 1.52% |
| 2025-03-31 | $74.65B | 0.55% |
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B | 3.17% |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B | 3.11% |

**Analysis:**
Shareholder Equity is robust and growing consistently, nearly reaching $80B. However, Return on Equity (ROE) remains relatively low, particularly in 2025, hovering between 0.55% and 1.72%. This low ROE indicates that while the company has a massive capital base, it is not generating profits efficiently relative to that large equity base, reflecting the massive scale and capital intensity of its recent growth phase.

### 7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)

TSLA remains a volatile, high-growth stock that has delivered historically exceptional performance (1050% cumulative return). However, its associated risk has also escalated, evidenced by a high Beta (2.3) and significant Maximum Drawdown (57.1%).

**Key Observations:**

*   **Fundamentals (Strong):** Recent quarterly financial data shows powerful sequential acceleration in both revenue and EPS through 2025. Profit margins are recovering and expanding.
*   **Technical Status (Bearish/Mixed):** The stock is facing medium-term resistance (below 20-day SMA). Momentum indicators (RSI 33.49, PPO negative) signal underlying weakness and oversold conditions, although a recent sharp daily rebound suggests short-term relief.
*   **Valuation and Risk (Cautionary):** The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) is cautious (0.7). Analyst consensus is "Hold," and the current price ($445.01) significantly exceeds the average target price ($403.32), indicating potential overvaluation relative to Wall Street expectations.
*   **Future Outlook:** Despite current technical and valuation concerns, the quantitative model projects an extremely high long-term growth potential (398.6% expected excess return), suggesting that the market continues to price in massive future expansion and innovation execution.

**Conclusion:**
TSLA is suitable only for investors with an extremely high tolerance for volatility and risk. While recent sequential financial performance has been excellent, the high valuation (relative to analyst targets), low ROE, and technical signals of recent weakness suggest near-term caution. The stock's performance remains highly dependent on successfully navigating operational risks (as hinted by recent news headlines) and fulfilling its long-term growth narrative in EVs and autonomy.
