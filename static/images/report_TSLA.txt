## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA (1109.94%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (128.31%).  The difference is 981.6%, placing it at the 57th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 1763.9%, min: -54.5%).  This indicates TSLA has historically outperformed the S&P 500, although the recent underperformance (2021-2024 CAGR) suggests a potential shift in relative performance.

The provided Alpha and Beta values reveal a high beta (generally above 3), indicating TSLA's price movements are significantly more volatile than the market.  However, positive alpha suggests consistent outperformance relative to the market.  Note that the Alpha and Beta values vary significantly from year to year and thus indicate considerable risk and market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $338.59 (Last-market: $338.4)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $343.76
* **20-day Moving Average:** $305.75
* **60-day Moving Average:** $259.05

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average and significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages.  This suggests potential short-term selling pressure but longer-term upward momentum. The closing price of $338.59 compared to the last market price of $338.4 shows minimal price change on this specific day, and doesn't indicate a significant jump (bullish) or drop (bearish) in the price.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 70.85 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.28 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +14.3% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1123.8% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is projected, though high-risk given the volatility).

The RSI nearing 70 suggests the stock might be overbought, indicating a potential pullback. However, the positive PPO and the recent positive relative divergence suggest continued upward momentum in the short term.  The high expected return highlights the potential for significant gains, but this also reflects the inherent risk of investing in a volatile stock like TSLA.


**4. Recent Financials & Outlook:**

The provided quarterly earnings show fluctuations in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue consistently remains high, EPS exhibits some variability.  Crucially, the most recent earnings data (2024-10-24) needs to be compared to analysts' estimates to properly assess its performance. Missing this crucial context prevents a thorough analysis of the recent results.  Further analysis requires understanding the reasons behind fluctuations in revenue and profitability, the impact of specific business developments (e.g., new product launches, price adjustments) and consideration of analyst forecasts for future performance.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable but Profit Margins are somewhat inconsistent, ranging from 17.35% to 19.84% with no clear upward or downward trend.  This requires further investigation into the company's cost structures and pricing strategies.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE shows significant fluctuation, notably a high ROE of 12.66% in Q4 2023, followed by a decline in subsequent quarters. This requires further analysis to understand underlying factors contributing to these variations.  Overall, both sections indicate a need for a deeper dive into underlying drivers of these financial numbers.


**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:**  (This section requires access to recent earnings news from sources like Shacknews and official Tesla releases.  Providing specific news headlines and summaries is crucial here.)
* **Market Outlook:** (This section requires analysis from sources like Finbold to provide current market sentiment on TSLA, including analyst ratings and forecasts.)  Current market outlooks should reflect the impact of the recent earnings report, overall market conditions and any other recent news impacting the stock.
* **Analyst Opinions:**  (A summary of analysts' opinions, including buy, sell, and hold recommendations is needed here).

**8. Summary:**

TSLA has historically shown exceptional returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent performance shows a decline and elevated volatility. While short-term indicators suggest a positive trend, the RSI indicates potential overbought conditions, and a complete picture requires understanding the latest earnings in context with analyst expectations.  The high projected long-term return reflects substantial upside potential but also signifies significant risk.  A thorough analysis necessitates access to the latest market news, analyst opinions, and a detailed breakdown of the quarterly financial statements (especially the October 24th report and analyst expectations). The significant fluctuations in ROE and Profitability highlight the need for a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and strategic direction.
