## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last day in the provided data is 1099.1 (1219.526 - 120.402).  The relative divergence of 66.7% indicates that TSLA's performance has been substantially higher than the S&P 500 over the period considered, placing it in the upper percentiles of past performance relative to the benchmark.  However, the provided  CAGR data shows significant volatility and negative returns in recent periods. This highlights the high risk associated with TSLA.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $400.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $381.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $349.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $282.45

The closing price of $400.99 is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  However, the last market price of $414.17 is significantly higher, indicating a recent, rapid price increase. This needs further investigation regarding the cause of this jump.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.22 –  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO:** 0.45 – Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.4 – Shows a recent short-term upward trend.

The significant difference between the closing price and last market price ($414.17) signals a sharp price increase.  This rapid upward movement could be a result of positive news or market speculation.  Further investigation is needed to determine the cause. The expected return of 908.5% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a very high projection and likely reflects the inherent volatility and potential for outsized gains (or losses) associated with Tesla's growth trajectory.  It is crucial to understand this projection is highly uncertain and relies on many assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some inconsistency. There is duplicate data for 2024-10-24.  Analyzing the remaining unique data:

* **Revenue:**  Revenue fluctuates, with a peak in Q2 2024. There's no clear consistent upward trend.
* **EPS:**  EPS shows fluctuations, with a peak in Q4 2024.  Again, no consistent upward trend is evident.  The reported EPS numbers need to be verified given the duplicate entry.

Without comparison to analyst expectations, it's impossible to determine whether these results beat or missed expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains high. Profit margin also fluctuates, with a high point in Q3 2024.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has generally increased.  ROE is highly volatile, with a significant spike in Q4 2023 and then a decrease in following quarters.  This volatility needs further investigation.

The financial data highlights considerable fluctuations in profitability and return on equity, emphasizing the high-growth, yet volatile nature of Tesla's business model.

Tesla's stock performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500 in the past, yet shows considerable volatility, reflected in both its price action and financial statements.  Recent price increases require investigation to identify the underlying causes.  While the long-term expected return is exceptionally high,  the high risk profile should be carefully considered.  Further information on recent news, analyst opinions, and a clarification on the inconsistencies in the provided earnings data are necessary for a more comprehensive and reliable assessment.
