| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $350.73
* **Previous Close:** $361.62
* **Change:** -$3.01 (a -0.83% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $371.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $397.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $390.68

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price drop reflects a potential correction after a period of high volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 20.25 (This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound, but also high risk.)
* **PPO:** -1.59 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.3% (Short-term downtrend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 570.4% (This represents a significant projected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, but this is a high-risk, high-reward scenario based on past performance that might not continue into the future.)


The significant negative change in price (-$3.01) is notable and should be considered in conjunction with the other indicators.  While the low RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and downward trend indicated by moving averages suggest caution.  The high expected return reflects Tesla’s historical high growth, but carries substantial risk.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $25.71B     | 16.26%        |

| 2024-09-30  | $69.93B     | 3.10% |

| 2023-12-31  | $62.63B     | 12.66% |


The significant drop in ROE from 12.66% to 3.23% between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024 warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's historical performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high growth and volatility.  However, recent data suggests a potential downturn.  While the stock is currently in oversold territory (RSI), negative momentum indicators (PPO) and the price's position below moving averages suggest a bearish trend.  The dramatic drop in ROE raises concerns about the company's profitability. The projected long-term outperformance (570.4%) is highly speculative and carries significant risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent decline in ROE and the overall market conditions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough examination of Tesla’s future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and potential risks is essential for informed investment analysis.
