The high CAGR figures, particularly in 2018-2021, demonstrate periods of exceptional growth, but also show significant volatility and negative returns in recent years. The consistently low beta suggests the stock's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $424.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $417.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $416.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $362.49

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, but the recent daily change (-0.57%) shows some short-term weakness.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.87 (slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.46 (negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.4 (indicates short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 371.3% (significantly higher than the S&P 500)

The recent price drop of -$0.57 does not indicate a significant downturn, considering the larger context. The high expected return reflects the historical high growth potential, but carries substantial risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |

| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18B      |

| 2024-10-24 | $0.58 | $23.35B (Duplicate entry - likely an error) |

Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains strong. EPS shows a mixed trend with some quarter-to-quarter variation.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B    | 19.84%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B    | 17.95%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B    | 17.63%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $23.35B    | 17.89%        |

Revenue is relatively stable, while profit margins show some variability but generally remain healthy.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE           |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B    | 3.10%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B    | 2.22%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38B    | 1.75%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $62.63B    | 12.66%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $53.47B    | 3.47%         |

Equity is increasing, but ROE shows significant fluctuation, with a notable spike in Q4 2023.  Further investigation into the reasons for this variation is warranted.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla demonstrates a history of exceptional growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over several periods. However, recent years have shown considerable volatility and negative returns.  Current technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook, but the long-term projected return remains exceptionally high.  Financial statements show generally healthy revenue and profitability, although the ROE displays some concerning inconsistencies that warrant further scrutiny.  Investors should carefully weigh the high potential returns against the significant risk associated with this volatile stock.  A thorough analysis of the reasons for the fluctuations in ROE and the duplicate earnings data entry is crucial before making any investment decisions.
