The substantial difference between the closing price ($320.83) and the 20-day ($275.01) and 60-day ($245.91) moving averages suggests a recent, potentially rapid, upward movement. The provided expected return of 101.23% over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon is a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but it's crucial to remember that this is a projected value with inherent uncertainty.

Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains above $20 Billion. Profit margins have been relatively consistent around 17-19%.


**6. Capital and Profitability Analysis:**

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:**  The prompt requests analysis of recent news (within 2 days) from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD, as well as analyst opinions and performance highlights.

Technical indicators point to positive momentum, but the RSI suggests approaching overbought territory.  The provided long-term expected return is high, but requires further investigation regarding its reliability and underlying assumptions.  A complete assessment requires additional data, specifically recent news coverage, analyst opinions, and comparison of reported earnings against analyst expectations.


**9. English Report Summary:**

Tesla (TSLA) exhibits a history of strong outperformance against the S&P 500, yet carries substantial volatility. Recent price action indicates a possible short-term correction after a rapid price increase.  While positive momentum signals exist (PPO), the RSI nears overbought levels, suggesting caution. The projected long-term return significantly surpasses the S&P 500, however,  validation through external news, analyst commentary, and a comparison of actual EPS against expectations are crucial.  The provided financial data reveals consistent revenue above $20 billion, with slight revenue fluctuations and stable profit margins.  The volatile ROE requires further investigation.  A comprehensive analysis necessitates inclusion of missing data points concerning recent news and analyst opinions, a vital element missing from the provided data.
