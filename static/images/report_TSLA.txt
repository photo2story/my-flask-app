* **5-Day Moving Average:** $340.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $313.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $263.07

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, it's significantly above its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term bullish trend.
