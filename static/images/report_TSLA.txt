* **60-Day Moving Average:** $283.56

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock has demonstrated exceptional growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this growth comes with high volatility.

Long-term prospects seem positive, supported by a high expected return, but inconsistencies in earnings data and ROE fluctuations require a more thorough analysis using complete and consistent data.  The high volatility necessitates a careful risk assessment before investment.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
