2024-12-19 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Cumulative Return vs. S&P 500:**

Tesla's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO), with a difference of 1358.17% as of the last data point. The relative divergence of 81.7 suggests that TSLA's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Company Overview:** Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high alpha, particularly from 2018 onwards, indicating substantial outperformance compared to the benchmark. The low beta suggests relatively low correlation with market movements.  However, the extremely high CAGR and alpha values in the 2018-2021 period should be interpreted with caution, as such extreme growth is unlikely to be sustainable.  The negative CAGR and alpha in 2021-2023 demonstrate the volatility of the stock.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $479.86
* Last Market Price: $475.22
* 5-Day Moving Average: $444.40
* 20-Day Moving Average: $378.65
* 60-Day Moving Average: $299.70

The stock price is currently above all moving averages, indicating a short-term upward trend. The substantial difference between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages suggests increasing momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 90.01 (Overbought) - This extremely high RSI suggests the stock is highly overbought and potentially due for a correction.
* PPO: 1.718 (Positive) -  A positive PPO confirms the upward momentum but should be considered alongside the overbought RSI.
* Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day): +15.0 -  Further reinforces the strong short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500.
* Expected Return: 753.0% -  This extremely high expected return should be treated with skepticism. While historical alpha has been strong, extrapolating it into the future is unreliable, especially given the recent volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* Latest Quarter (2024-10-24): EPS $0.68, Revenue $25.18B
* Previous Quarters:  Revenue shows some fluctuation, with a dip in Q1 2024 ($21.30B) before recovering.  EPS has generally increased, though there was a slight dip in Q2 2024 ($0.46). The table shows a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24 with different EPS.  This needs clarification as it could be an error. Without expectations data, it's impossible to comment on beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue fluctuated over the past five quarters, with the highest in Q2 2024 ($25.50B).
* **Profit Margin:**  Profit margins have remained relatively stable in the 17-19% range, with the highest in the most recent quarter (19.84%).
* **Equity:**  Equity has steadily increased, indicating growth in the company's underlying value.
* **ROE:** ROE fluctuated significantly, with a high of 12.66% in Q4 2023 followed by a substantial decline in subsequent quarters. This volatility requires further investigation.



**6. News and Recent Issues:**

Information about recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is not provided.  This information is crucial for a comprehensive analysis.

**7. Summary:**

Tesla has demonstrated impressive historical growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action indicates the stock is currently overbought, and the extremely high expected return should be viewed with caution. While revenue and profit margins have generally been strong, the volatility in ROE raises concerns.  A complete analysis requires additional information regarding recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, as well as clarification of the duplicate earnings entry.


**8. Overall Recommendation:**

While the long-term potential of Tesla remains a subject of debate among analysts, the current technical indicators suggest caution.  The stock appears overbought, and further investigation is needed to understand the fluctuating ROE and reconcile the conflicting EPS data for Q4 2024. Investors should carefully consider the risks before making any investment decisions and seek additional information to make informed choices.
