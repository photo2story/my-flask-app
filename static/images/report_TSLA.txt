## Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Review

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  The final cumulative return difference is 1101.5 percentage points.  This places its relative divergence at the 66.9th percentile based on historical data â€“ meaning its outperformance relative to its past performance against VOO is relatively high, but not at an extreme level.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly variable performance across different periods.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) was exceptionally high in some periods (reaching over 1400%), it also experienced dramatic declines. Notably, the Alpha (measure of excess return compared to the benchmark) fluctuates, suggesting inconsistent outperformance relative to the market. The Beta (systematic risk) also fluctuates, showing varying levels of market sensitivity.  Capitalization (Cap) shows substantial growth over the period.  These fluctuations highlight Tesla's volatility and dependence on market sentiment, even as its size has significantly increased.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 404.60
* **Last Market Price:** 384.71 (a decrease of -4.92 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 397.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 405.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 382.52

The price is currently below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend. However, it is above the 60-day moving average, suggesting potential support. The significant drop in the last market price (-4.92) signals a notable price decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.81 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)

* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.2 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 410.2% (This represents a significantly higher expected return than the S&P 500 over the long term.)  This projection needs to be considered cautiously given the volatility of Tesla stock and potential for error in such a long-term projection.

The significant price drop in the "Last-market" data suggests a potential negative market reaction to recent news or events, warranting further investigation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies, with duplicate entries for certain dates.  Analyzing the unique data points:

Revenue remains relatively stable, but EPS fluctuates.  Further analysis would require investigation into potential causes of the EPS fluctuation and clarification of the duplicate entries.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock performance has been exceptionally volatile, with periods of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 interspersed with substantial drops. While the cumulative return is impressive, its highly variable nature suggests significant risk.  The recent price drop, negative PPO, and fluctuating financial metrics point to a need for cautious observation. The high expected return projection should be viewed with extreme skepticism due to the inherent volatility and inherent uncertainty of such a long term prediction.  Further investigation into the reasons behind recent EPS and ROE fluctuations is crucial, as is a deeper dive into the market events that precipitated the recent price drop.  A long-term investment decision should be made with a full understanding of this inherent volatility and a thorough analysis of market factors affecting the stock's price.
