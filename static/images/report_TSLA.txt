Further analysis with complete data (including multiple quarters) is needed to draw significant conclusions about earnings trends.  The duplication of entries in the table suggests a data entry issue and requires clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This crucial information is needed to assess Tesla's profitability and overall financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla has shown remarkable growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this performance has been accompanied by substantial volatility.  While long-term prospects appear positive, based on the high expected return,  short-term price movements may experience fluctuations. The lack of complete financial data limits a thorough assessment of the company's financial health. Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with the stock before investing.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and securing complete financial statements are crucial for a more robust analysis.
