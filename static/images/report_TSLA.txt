## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1297.76%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.07%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1175.69%.  This places TSLA at the 71.2nd percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, based on a range of -53.1% to 1673.3%.  The alpha consistently shows outperformance, though the beta fluctuates significantly.  Note that high beta values (especially in 2018-2021) indicate heightened sensitivity to market movements.  The massive drop in CAGR from 2021-2023 (-456%) is a significant red flag.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $424.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $394.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $353.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $285.73

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish trend in the short-to-medium term.  The significant difference between the closing price and the moving averages indicates a recent rapid price increase.  The reported last market price of $424.29 confirms this upward trend, suggesting a recent sharp rally.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 79.93 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.879 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +12.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 853.5% (This represents a significant projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year period.  This figure needs to be treated cautiously and should be considered alongside other factors.)

The high RSI value suggests the stock is overbought and a price correction might be imminent.  However, the positive PPO and recent relative divergence indicate continued upward momentum.  The significant expected return highlights the potential for substantial long-term growth but carries inherent risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The most recent quarter (2024-10-24) shows a slight decrease in revenue compared to the previous quarter (2024-07-24)  ($25.18B vs $25.50B).  EPS also slightly decreased from $0.46 to $0.68. There's variability in both revenue and EPS across the reported quarters.  A more detailed analysis would require comparing these figures to market expectations at the time of each earnings release.  Note that there's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates, showing some recent decline.
* **Profit Margin:** Remains relatively stable, ranging between 17% and 19.84%.  The increase in the latest quarter is a positive sign.
* **Equity:** Shows a general upward trend, indicating growth in shareholder equity.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):**  Highly volatile.  The significant spike in ROE in Q4 2023 (12.66%) is noteworthy, followed by a sharp decrease in subsequent quarters.  This requires further investigation to understand the underlying drivers.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500 historically, indicating significant outperformance. However, recent price action reveals a possible overbought condition and the need for caution.  While the recent price surge is positive, the volatility in earnings, financial metrics, and the substantial drop in CAGR from 2021-2023 raise concerns regarding long-term stability.  A deep dive into the reasons for the recent price surge and further examination of the company's financial health, along with up-to-date news and analyst opinions, are critical before making any investment decisions. The high expected return should be viewed with skepticism, given the inherent risks associated with such a volatile stock.
