## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last day in the provided data is 1080.2 percentage points.  This places TSLA's performance at the 62.4th percentile relative to its historical performance range against the VOO, indicating strong outperformance.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 suggest that the returns are primarily driven by market movements (beta), rather than manager skill (alpha).  The substantial volatility (MDD) highlights significant risk associated with TSLA investment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $369.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $356.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $338.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $274.23

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although this should be interpreted within the context of the high volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.95 – This suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating a potential short-term pullback.
* **PPO:** -0.356 – A negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (-) - This absence of data prevents a proper assessment of short-term divergence.  However, the combination of RSI and PPO suggests cautious outlook.
* **Expected Return:** 1042.5% – This represents a substantial long-term (2+ years) expected excess return compared to the S&P 500.  This projection should be viewed with extreme caution, given the high volatility and uncertainty inherent in such long-term predictions.  The 369.49 price point does not appear to signify a significant sudden change.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** While revenue generally stays above $20B, there's no consistent upward trend.  There is a slight decrease in revenue from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024, and a more significant increase from Q3 2023 to Q1 2024.
* **EPS:** EPS has fluctuated, with no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent.  There is some variability in quarterly earnings.

**Missing information:** The table contains duplicate entries for 2024-10-24.  We need consistent and complete data for a more precise analysis.  Also, missing information regarding analyst expectations prevents analysis of beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows fluctuations, but it generally remains high. Profit margins are relatively consistent, hovering around 17-19%. The slight dip in Q1 2024 followed by a small rise in Q2 2024 and another small dip in Q3 2024, shows some variability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been generally increasing, but ROE is highly volatile.  The significant drop and subsequent increase between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 requires further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires recent news articles and analyst opinions to provide comprehensive coverage.  Without specific recent news and market outlook, this portion cannot be completed.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this should not be taken as a guarantee of future performance.  The company's earnings show variability in both revenue and EPS, requiring further analysis with complete and consistent data.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback despite the stock trading above its moving averages.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be treated with extreme skepticism due to its inherent uncertainties.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions hinders a complete evaluation of current market sentiment.  Overall, a thorough due diligence incorporating up-to-date information is crucial before making any investment decision.
