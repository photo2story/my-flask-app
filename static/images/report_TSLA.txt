## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Performance Review

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return (2656.73%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (88.48%). The difference is 2568.2%, placing it at the 84.9th percentile of the historical range (-65.1% to 3037.1%).  This indicates Tesla's exceptional performance relative to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows extremely high growth rates, particularly from 2018 onwards, exceeding 1000% in several periods.  While Alpha values generally remain positive indicating outperformance, Beta values are inconsistent, fluctuating significantly between periods and reflecting considerable market sensitivity, especially in periods of high growth.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has also grown dramatically, reflecting Tesla's expansion.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $287.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $285.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $257.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $278.49

The price is above its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting positive short-term and intermediate-term momentum. However, it is significantly above its 20-day moving average, potentially indicating an overbought condition. The recent price increase of $2.38 (from $280.52) suggests a recent upward trend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 65.70 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.15 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 470.4% (Long-term, 2+ years, significantly outperforming the S&P 500)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO and recent price action suggest bullish momentum, the RSI nearing overbought levels and negative 20-day relative divergence suggest caution.  The high expected return highlights the potential for substantial long-term gains, but this should be viewed in the context of the considerable risk associated with Tesla's volatility.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-04-23 | $0.13  | $19.34B      |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68  | $25.18B      |

| 2024-07-24 | $0.46  | $25.50B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.46  | $25.50B      |

There appears to be some duplication in the data.  Revenue is relatively stable, but EPS fluctuates significantly. Further analysis is required to determine the underlying reasons for these fluctuations.  A consistent revenue stream is positive, but volatile EPS needs further investigation.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $19.34B    | 16.31%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B    | 16.26%        |

| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B    | 17.95%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B    | 17.35%        |

Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains strong.  Profit margins are relatively consistent, though showing some variation.  Further analysis is needed to identify the drivers of these changes.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE    |
|------------|------------|--------|
| 2025-03-31 | $74.65B    | 0.55%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B    | 3.23%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B    | 3.10%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.47B    | 2.22%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $64.38B    | 2.16%  |

Equity is growing steadily, but ROE is volatile. The significant drop in ROE in Q1 2025 requires further investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has been exceptionally strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this performance is coupled with high volatility.  While the long-term outlook appears positive, based on the high expected return,  investors should be aware of the potential for significant short-term price swings. The recent price increase might signal further upward movement, but indicators suggest a potential overbought situation.  Further analysis is needed to reconcile the volatile EPS and ROE figures with the overall strong revenue growth and market capitalization.  Careful consideration of risk tolerance is crucial before investing in Tesla.  Cleaning up the duplicated data and performing a more in-depth analysis of financial statements and industry trends is recommended for a more complete assessment.
