## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1335.46%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.91%.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high volatility and significant swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD (Maximum Drawdown), and Alpha.  Beta remains consistently low, suggesting low correlation with the overall market. However, the extremely high CAGRs and Alpha in some periods are likely unsustainable.  The drastic -456% CAGR in 2021-2023 highlights the significant risk associated with TSLA.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $436.23
* **5-day Moving Average:** $413.98
* **20-day Moving Average:** $364.48
* **60-day Moving Average:** $292.12

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential uptrend, but the significant gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicates recent volatility.  The price of 436.19 shows a recent price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 78.33 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.05 –  A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +9.0 – Shows a short-term upward trend.

Given the RSI being significantly above 70 and the price of 436.19 (Last-market: 436.19) reflecting a recent price increase, a potential short-term price correction should be considered.  The expected return of 832.6% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a highly optimistic projection and should be treated with caution.  High projected returns often correlate with high risk.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly results show some inconsistencies:

* **Revenue:**  Revenue fluctuates, with a peak in Q2 2024 ($25.50B) followed by a slight dip in Q3 2024 ($25.18B). Overall, the trend shows relative stability rather than a consistent upward trend.
* **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS also fluctuates, with no clear upward or downward trend.  The highest EPS is reported in Q3 2024 at $0.68. There is a duplication of data for Oct 24, 2024.
* **Comparison:** There is no clear consistent trend for revenue growth or EPS.  We can't assess "beats or misses" without additional information (e.g., analyst expectations).

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable around the $25B mark with minor fluctuations. Profit margins show some variability, peaking at 19.84% in Q3 2024.  There is no clear upward or downward trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has generally increased. ROE (Return on Equity) shows significant variability and a drastic drop in Q4 2023, which then rebounds slightly.  This inconsistency highlights volatility and the need for further investigation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has been exceptionally strong historically, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the recent data reveals considerable volatility in both price and financial metrics.  The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, and the high expected return is a highly optimistic prediction with inherently high risk.  The inconsistent financial results and volatile price action indicate a need for careful consideration and risk management.  Further analysis requires clarification of conflicting data points (such as duplicated entries in the earnings report), as well as incorporating recent news and analyst sentiment to provide a complete picture.  The high growth potential should be balanced against the potential for significant losses, emphasizing the importance of a robust investment strategy and risk tolerance.
