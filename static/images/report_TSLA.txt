The difference is 1273.7%, placing it at the 76.9th percentile of historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's min/max range.  The alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market, even though the Beta is relatively low. This indicates TSLA's returns are less sensitive to market movements than some other stocks.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $454.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $440.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $408.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $318.01

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The significant gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a recent acceleration in price movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (68.25):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70), suggesting potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (-0.54):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.  This contrasts with the price action, warranting further investigation.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+2.3):** Shows a recent upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (313.4%):**  The projected long-term (2+ years) return significantly exceeds the S&P 500's expected return. This high expected return should be viewed with caution, as it relies on the projection and might not be realized.  The current price of $454.13, considering the RSI and PPO, doesn't necessarily indicate an imminent sharp uptrend or downtrend, instead signaling potential volatility.

The provided data shows mixed trends:

* **Revenue:** Revenue generally shows an increasing trend with a slight dip in Q1 2024.  The highest revenue was recorded in Q2 2024.
* **EPS:** EPS shows variability across quarters.  While Q4 2023 and Q4 2024 EPS values are the same, the Q3 2024 EPS is slightly higher than Q2 2024's.
* **Comparison:**  There is no information provided to compare reported numbers to expectations.  Hence any beats or misses analysis cannot be performed based on the data available.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows a steady growth pattern while ROE fluctuates significantly, suggesting changes in profitability and capital structure.

No information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered. However, recent technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest potential short-term volatility. While the long-term expected return is high, this should be viewed cautiously due to the inherent uncertainty in such projections. Financial statements reflect fluctuating profitability and revenue,  requiring further analysis to pinpoint potential drivers of these changes.  Lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive assessment. The high expected return necessitates careful consideration of risk tolerance and investment horizon.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for changes in EPS and ROE are crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.
