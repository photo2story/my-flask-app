*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |

| 2024-2026  | 1180.0%  | 86.0% | 1074.0% | -0.0  | 1501.6 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A staggering 1180.0% CAGR highlights exceptional growth potential. However, it's crucial to understand that such high growth rates are often unsustainable long-term.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The 86.0% MDD indicates substantial risk and volatility. Investors experienced significant losses at some point during the analyzed period.
*   **Alpha:** The extremely high alpha (1074.0%) suggests Tesla has significantly outperformed its expected return based on its risk profile (beta).
*   **Beta:** A beta close to 0 means that the return of the asset does not move with the market (VOO) (i.e. it moves independently of market trends).
*   **Cap(B):** The company capitalization is 1501.6 Billion US dollars.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  The MRI of 0.9 suggests that the model views Tesla as a good investment opportunity (high investment recommended).
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 54.44 indicates a neutral momentum. It is neither overbought (above 70) nor oversold (below 30).

*   **Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence suggests Tesla has been underperforming the S&P 500 recently.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

    *   **Cathie Wood Dumps $30 Million Worth Tesla Stock:** This could indicate a change in sentiment from a prominent investor, potentially signaling concerns.
    *   **Tesla supplier slashes a $2.9 billion battery deal to $7,386:** This is a potentially negative signal, suggesting challenges in Tesla's supply chain or manufacturing plans.
    *   **Tesla (TSLA) Stock Slides 2% On China Ban:** Restrictions in China, a major market for Tesla, are concerning.
*   **Positive/Neutral Catalysts:**
    *   **Big Moves On The Horizon For Tesla Stock With These Two Deadlines Looming:**  This suggests anticipation of potential positive developments.
    *   **Investor Michael Burry Rules Out Tesla Short Position:** This reduces short-selling pressure.

**Analysis:**

*   The recent news is mixed. There are concerning reports regarding supply chain issues, sales restrictions in China, and a large stock sale by a prominent investor. However, counterbalancing these are positive signals like Investor Michael Burry ruling out Tesla short position.

*   It's difficult to assess the weight of each news item without more context. The supply chain issue and China ban are likely more significant concerns than the Burry news. The mixed news creates uncertainty and increased volatility.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Tesla has demonstrated exceptional historical growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  The high CAGR, alpha, and expected return figures reflect this past success. However, this high growth comes with substantial volatility and risk, as evidenced by the high MDD.

Recent data paints a more nuanced picture. While revenue continues to grow, EPS has been declining. The stock price is currently below its short-term moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend. Analyst consensus is "Hold," with an average target price below the current price, which could indicate overvaluation.  Recent news is mixed, with concerns about supply chain disruptions and China sales restrictions being offset somewhat by positive sentiment from some investors.

**Overall:**

Tesla remains a potentially high-reward, but also high-risk investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.  The extremely high expected return should be viewed with caution, and a thorough assessment of Tesla's future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and execution capabilities is essential before making an investment decision. Given the conflicting signals, a neutral or slightly cautious stance may be warranted. Pay close attention to future earnings reports and any developments related to the news events mentioned above.
