| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30B      |

There's a duplication of data in the earnings report, requiring clarification for a thorough analysis.  However, revenue appears relatively stable, while EPS shows some fluctuation.  Further investigation is needed to understand the inconsistencies.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE      |
|---------|------------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $72.91B   | 3.23%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $69.93B   | 3.10%    |

Equity is growing, but ROE shows a significant drop in recent quarters, requiring further investigation.  The exceptionally high ROE in Q4 2023 needs context.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's long-term performance has been extraordinary, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action indicates a potential short-term downturn.  The high projected long-term return and positive Alpha suggest continued growth potential.  However, investors should monitor the recent price decline, earnings inconsistencies, and the decline in ROE.  Further investigation into the data discrepancies and macroeconomic factors is crucial before making investment decisions.  The medium risk assessment (MRI) coupled with the bearish short-term indicators warrants a cautious approach.
