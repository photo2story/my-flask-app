**1. Performance Comparison (TSLA vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Ticker:** TSLA (Tesla Inc.) - An electric vehicle and clean energy company.
*   **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 1106.98%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.36%

*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. High MDD values (72-86%) indicate significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Measures the performance of the investment compared to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500), after accounting for risk (Beta). Positive Alpha indicates outperformance on a risk-adjusted basis. The high Alpha values, especially in 2018-2025, underscore Tesla's substantial outperformance.
*   **Beta:**  Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta of 1 means the stock moves in line with the market.  Beta values are quite low (close to 0). This implies that TSLA is more aggressive stock and risk-takers can consider in the portfolio.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in Billions

**Analysis:** The table shows both Tesla's impressive growth and its significant volatility. The high Alpha values suggest that Tesla's outperformance is not simply due to market movements, but rather to company-specific factors.
