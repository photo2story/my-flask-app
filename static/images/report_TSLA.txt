## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

The cumulative return of TSLA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between TSLA and VOO as of the last data point is 1198.5%. This places TSLA's relative divergence at the 72.5th percentile based on historical data's minimum (-53.2%) and maximum (1673.1%) divergence.  While this suggests strong outperformance, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results. The provided alpha values consistently show marginal outperformance relative to the market (Beta).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $430.60
* **Last Market Price:** $456.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $441.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $396.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $311.40

The last market price of $456.70 indicates a recent price jump above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. However, it's still below the long-term trend indicated by the 60-day average. This warrants further investigation to determine whether this jump is a sustained trend or a temporary fluctuation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.84 – Indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory.
* **PPO:** -0.64 – Suggests a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.0% – Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.

The significant jump to $456.70 from the closing price of $430.60 could be interpreted as a sharp upward movement, potentially influenced by positive news or market sentiment.  The projected long-term expected return of 355.8% compared to the S&P 500 over two years or more is a highly optimistic forecast and should be viewed with significant caution. It's crucial to remember that such a high expected return is highly unlikely and susceptible to significant market volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in both revenue and EPS.  Revenue generally remains around the $25 Billion mark, showing limited significant growth in recent quarters.  EPS has also shown some volatility, with no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent from this limited data. There is no information to compare reported numbers against expectations.  Further analysis with a longer time horizon and the context of analyst expectations would provide a more complete picture.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue has been relatively stable, hovering around $25B in recent quarters, with a dip to $21.3B in Q1 2024.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have fluctuated, generally ranging between 17% and 20%.  A notable increase occurred in Q3 2024.
* **Equity:** Equity has shown steady growth, although there was a slight dip between Q1 and Q2 2024.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE displays significant volatility and a significant drop from 12.66% in Q4 2023 to 3.10% in Q3 2024.  This requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  The provided data lacks details on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions within the last two days.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has demonstrated significant historical outperformance against the S&P 500. However, recent indicators suggest potential short-term volatility. The relatively high RSI and the negative PPO suggest that the stock might be overbought and potentially due for a correction. The substantial difference between the closing price and the last market price indicates recent price action that needs further investigation. The fluctuation in financial metrics, particularly ROE, highlights the importance of conducting thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. The provided expected return is highly speculative and should not be relied upon for investment decisions.  More detailed information on recent news and analyst sentiment is necessary for a comprehensive assessment.
