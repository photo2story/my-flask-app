**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but with significant volatility.

Short-term indicators suggest some caution is warranted, with RSI approaching overbought territory and a slight negative short-term divergence.  A thorough examination of the duplicated earnings data and a deeper dive into the drivers of revenue and profit margin changes are crucial for a more complete assessment.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in TSLA.
