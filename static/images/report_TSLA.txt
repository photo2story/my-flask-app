## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 908.04%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 174.04%. The difference is 734.0%, placing it at the 56.41st percentile of its historical range of divergence (max: 1358.52%, min: -74.08%).  This indicates strong outperformance relative to the broader market, though the relative percentile suggests this level of outperformance has been seen before.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high growth rates (CAGR) in most periods, exceeding the market significantly (Beta consistently above 1).  However,  recent years (2021-2024) show a deceleration in growth and even negative returns, suggesting market sensitivity and potential cyclical factors.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures also highlight the significant risk associated with Tesla's stock.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $320.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $328.13 (slightly below)
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $275.01 (significantly above)
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $245.91 (significantly above)

The price is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend, but the 5-day average being higher hints at a recent minor correction.  The significant difference between the short-term and long-term moving averages indicates volatility.  The last market price of $320.83 is not significantly different from the closing price to trigger a "sharp jump" or "sharp drop" conclusion.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 66.29 – Suggests the stock is in slightly overbought territory, indicating potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.81 – A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +18.6% – Shows a recent increase in the relative strength of TSLA compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 126.29% – This is a significant projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but it's crucial to remember that this is a forecast and subject to significant uncertainty.  Long-term investment strategies should account for potential volatility.

**4. Recent Financials & Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows fluctuating quarterly revenue and earnings, with EPS showing some decline recently.  While revenue remains strong (generally above $20B), the profit margins are relatively consistent (around 17-20%) but not exhibiting strong growth.  A more detailed analysis, including a comparison to analyst expectations for the most recent quarter (2024-10-24), is needed to get a complete picture.  The provided data lacks this key context.

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The revenue is consistently high, but profit margin shows minor fluctuations without a clear upward trend.  ROE (Return on Equity) is highly volatile, swinging from exceptionally high to low values in consecutive quarters, indicating inconsistent profitability and potentially significant investment cycles.  Further investigation into the drivers behind these fluctuations is required for a thorough analysis.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by strong growth and high CAGR. However, recent performance has been less impressive, highlighting the risk inherent in investing in this high-growth, high-volatility stock.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction, while the long-term outlook remains positive based on the forecast of substantial outperformance, but this should be viewed with caution considering the volatile nature of the company and the general uncertainty associated with long-term predictions.  A thorough review of recent earnings reports and analyst opinions is crucial to assessing the current situation more accurately.  The provided financial data reveals some inconsistencies in profitability, needing more in-depth analysis.
