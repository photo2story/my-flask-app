2024-11-27 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1109.94%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.31%. The difference in cumulative returns is 981.6%, placing it at the 57th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  While this shows significant outperformance, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The high relative percentile suggests this outperformance is relatively extreme compared to historical data.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Close Price:** $338.59 (Last Market: $339.47)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $343.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $305.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $259.05

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. However, it's significantly above its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend. The difference between the last market price and the close price is minimal, suggesting minimal change within the trading day.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 70.85 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.28 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +14.3% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1123.8% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 expected)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term, potentially leading to a correction.  However, the positive PPO and recent relative divergence indicate ongoing upward momentum. The extraordinarily high expected return needs careful consideration; this is a projection based on past performance, and achieving this return is not guaranteed.  A price of $339.47 doesn't trigger any specific alerts for sudden price spikes or drops, given the other indicators.
