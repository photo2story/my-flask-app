**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines reveal a mix of factors influencing Tesla's stock:

*   **Robotaxi Development:**  Headlines focus on deadlines, forecasts, and debates surrounding Tesla's robotaxi plans.

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. Positive sentiment and high valuation targets are countered by delivery forecast concerns, a probe, and discussions of margin pressures. The robotaxi development is a key focus and a potential catalyst for future growth, but carries execution risk.

The average target price is *below* the current price, indicating potential downside risk according to the average analyst expectation.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜         | EPS   | 매출        |

| 2025-01-30   | 0.68  | 25.18 B$    |

**Analysis:**  Revenue and EPS show a trend of growth in the recent quarters. However, the EPS of the latest quarter (2025-10-23) is below the prior periods. This suggests a potential slow-down of earnings relative to the revenue.

**6) Financial Information:**

| 2024-09-30   | $69.93B   | 3.11%   |

**Analysis:** Revenue is generally increasing, with a recent spike in the last reported quarter. The profit margin has fluctuated, indicating varying levels of profitability. Equity is consistently growing. ROE (Return on Equity) has declined sharply in the latest quarter, which is concerning.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Tesla has demonstrated substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by high growth rates and positive alpha. However, this comes with significant volatility, as indicated by the high maximum drawdowns.

The recent stock performance suggests a short-term pull back after a period of growth.  Technical indicators like the MRI suggest a favorable investment environment, but the RSI nearing overbought territory warrants caution.

Recent news is mixed, highlighting opportunities (robotaxi, analyst targets) but also challenges (probes, margin concerns). Analyst sentiment, on average, is neutral with a "Hold" rating, and the average target price implies potential downside risk.

While the recent earnings and financial data indicate revenue growth, there's a concerning decline in ROE.  The latest EPS report also showed a lower number, indicating potential slow-down in earnings relative to the revenue.

**Overall, Tesla remains a high-growth, high-risk stock. While long-term growth potential remains, investors should be aware of the volatility and be cautious of potential short-term pullbacks.** The declining ROE and EPS in the latest reported quarter needs to be investigated further.
