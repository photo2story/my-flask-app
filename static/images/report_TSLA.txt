The difference is 1157.6%, placing it at the 70.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a substantial outperformance, but the provided range (max: 1673.1, min: -53.2) suggests periods of both significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
