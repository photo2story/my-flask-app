**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 2325.23% for TSLA versus 78.93% for VOO.  The difference (2246.3%) places TSLA at the 74.5th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (max: 3037.1%, min: -65.1%). This highlights Tesla's substantial outperformance relative to the broader market.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Tesla (TSLA) has demonstrated exceptional historical returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this comes with substantial volatility, as indicated by high Beta values and significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term bearish trend despite a recent price jump, while indicators like RSI and PPO offer mixed signals.  The provided earnings data shows inconsistencies that require further investigation for accurate analysis.  The projected long-term expected return is extraordinarily high and needs to be critically assessed, considering the inherent risks associated with Tesla's high volatility and the uncertainties of future market performance.  A thorough analysis requires a more complete and consistent dataset, along with further consideration of qualitative factors such as industry trends and competitive landscape.  Investors should proceed with caution and diversify their portfolios appropriately.
