## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Performance Review

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return (1184.15%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (89.44%). The difference is 1094.7%, placing it at the 67.3rd percentile of its historical range (max divergence: 1648.6%, min: -44.5%).  This highlights Tesla's substantial outperformance relative to the broader market, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and varying performance over different periods. While Alpha consistently demonstrates outperformance against the market (positive values), Beta indicates high sensitivity to market movements, particularly in recent years (2021-2023 showing a high beta of 0.7). The significant CAGR fluctuations reflect Tesla's high-growth, high-risk profile.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $268.46
* **Last Market Price:** $276.32 (a $2.93 increase from the previous close, indicating a recent positive price movement)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $267.27
* **20-day Moving Average:** $254.19
* **60-day Moving Average:** $331.42

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it remains below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downward trend. The recent price increase of $2.93 might reflect positive market sentiment, or it may be short-lived given the high volatility.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk) suggests moderate market volatility.
* **RSI:** 57.04 (slightly above neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions).
* **PPO:** 2.25 (positive value suggesting potential upward momentum).
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -5.8% (short-term downward trend).
* **Expected Return:** 466.3% (over 2 years)  This extremely high expected return relative to the S&P 500 should be considered with caution, given the inherent risks associated with Tesla's volatile nature.  The high expected return indicates a potentially high reward but also underscores the high-risk profile. The recent price jump of $2.93, while positive, doesn't necessarily alter the long-term projection given Tesla's overall volatility.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some consistency in EPS and revenue figures between consecutive reporting periods (e.g., 2024-10-24 and 2025-01-30). However, this needs further investigation as it's not clear from the provided data whether this is due to reporting inconsistencies or actual flat growth.  A more comprehensive analysis would need more quarters' data to determine reliable revenue and EPS growth trends. More data is required to assess the health of the business.

**5) Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue shows some fluctuation but overall maintains relatively high levels over the reported period.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are relatively stable, generally above 16%, indicating a consistently profitable operation.
* **Equity:**  Equity has been steadily growing, although there is a noticeable decrease in Q1 2024.
* **ROE:** Return on Equity has shown volatility, with a significant drop in recent quarters. The sharp drop from 12.66% to 3.23% from 2023-12-31 to 2024-12-31 requires further investigation. This warrants a deeper analysis to understand the underlying factors.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's past performance demonstrates significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, its high volatility (as reflected in the high Beta and substantial MDD values in the Alpha/Beta analysis) poses considerable risk.  The recent price increase is positive, but the sustained outperformance against the market needs context with recent financial results. The high expected return projection should be treated with caution due to the inherently risky nature of Tesla's stock. The recent financial information presents a mixed picture; while revenue and profit margins remain generally healthy, the declining ROE requires more thorough investigation. A long-term investment requires careful consideration of the company's risk profile.  Additional data and a more comprehensive fundamental analysis are needed for a more informed investment decision.
