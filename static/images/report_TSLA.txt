**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $263.55
* Last Market Price: $254.375 (Down $3.48)
* 5-day Moving Average: $275.05
* 20-day Moving Average: $255.64
* 60-day Moving Average: $335.67

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The recent drop of $3.48 represents a significant single-day decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* RSI: 63.19 (Slightly above neutral, not overbought)
* PPO: 2.62 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day): -2.8% (Short-term downward trend)

The relatively low MRI suggests a moderate risk level.  The RSI and PPO offer mixed signals, while the negative relative strength change confirms the short-term bearish trend.  The significant price drop of -$3.48 suggests a potential short-term correction.

The expected return of 477.9% over the long term (2+ years) represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this projection needs to be considered within the context of Tesla's high volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistencies, with duplicate entries for Q1 and Q2 2025.  The data suggests relatively stable revenue around $25 Billion, but EPS fluctuates.  Further clarification on the data is needed.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18B     |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18B     |  <-- Duplicate entry
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46 | $25.50B     |

| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, hovering around $25B.  Profit margins are generally healthy, ranging from 16% to nearly 20%, but showed some fluctuations.  Equity is growing, but ROE is inconsistent,  significantly dropping in the latest quarter (Q4 2024).  This needs further investigation.

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity     | ROE    |
|------------|------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B    | 16.26%        | $72.91B    | 3.23%  |

| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B    | 17.63%        | $62.63B    | 12.66% |


**6. Summary:**

Tesla (TSLA) shows a history of significantly outperforming the S&P 500, but with high volatility. Recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  While long-term projections are positive, the high volatility and inconsistent financial metrics (especially ROE) warrant careful consideration. Further investigation is needed into the duplicated earnings data and the sudden drop in ROE.  Investors should assess their risk tolerance before investing in TSLA due to its inherent volatility.
