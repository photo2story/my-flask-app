### 2. Alpha, Beta Analysis

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta    | Cap(B)  |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| 2015-2017  | 29.0%   | 52.4%  | -3.0%    | 0.0     | 66.9    |
| 2016-2018  | 39.0%   | 68.3%  | 18.0%    | -0.1    | 71.5    |
| 2017-2019  | 32.0%   | 68.3%  | -2.0%    | 0.3     | 89.8    |
| 2018-2020  | 1125.0% | 68.3%  | 1094.0%  | 0.2     | 757.6   |
| 2019-2021  | 1751.0% | 63.9%  | 1691.0%  | 0.1     | 1134.6  |
| 2020-2022  | 640.0%  | 74.6%  | 631.0%   | 0.3     | 396.8   |
| 2021-2023  | 428.0%  | 74.6%  | 407.0%   | 0.6     | 800.3   |
| 2022-2024  | 1214.0% | 74.6%  | 1193.0%  | 0.7     | 1300.8  |
| 2023-2025  | 1635.0% | 69.9%  | 1609.0%  | 0.9     | 960.7   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Compound Annual Growth Rate is consistently high, indicating strong historical growth.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown shows substantial potential downside risk (ranging from ~52% to ~75%).
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are overwhelmingly positive and significant, suggesting TSLA has consistently generated returns above what would be expected based on market movements alone. This points to company-specific factors driving returns.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low (close to zero in some periods, and approaching 1 more recently).  A Beta near zero suggests TSLA's price movements have been largely independent of the overall market. Higher Betas in recent years (0.6, 0.7, 0.9) indicate a greater sensitivity to the market, suggesting Tesla's performance is becoming more correlated with the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap in Billions shows fluctuating size but overall growth of the company.

### 3. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** $298.26
*   **Previous Close:** $284.82
*   **Change:** 4.72 (+4.72 from previous close implies a significant jump)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 282.98
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 267.25
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 272.87

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages, indicating a short-term uptrend. The significant price change from the previous close suggests a possible recent catalyst driving positive momentum. The significant change (4.72) does indicate a volatile event impacting the stock price, warranting investigation into news or reports that may have caused the surge.

### 4. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3707 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 80.11 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 1.19
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** 3.4 (+), indicating short-term upward trend
*   **Expected Return:** 431.5% (over a long-term investment horizon, relative to the S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a low-risk environment, which seems contradictory given the stock's volatility. This potentially reflects the overall market sentiment or a specific model used for risk assessment.
*   The RSI indicates that TSLA is currently overbought and may be due for a correction.
*   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being positive confirms the upward price momentum.
*   A 3.4 increase in the 20-day relative spread suggests that the short-term uptrend is driven by Tesla outperforming the S&P 500.
*   The very high expected return (431.5%) suggests significant confidence in Tesla's long-term growth potential, far exceeding the risk-free rate and likely implying substantial risk. This is a very bullish prediction, and the investor must consider the underlying assumptions.

### 5. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Trade Tensions:** Halt of US-made Model S and Model X orders in China due to increased import tariffs.
*   **Cybertruck Demand:** Launch of cheaper rear-wheel-drive Cybertruck variant; declining sales in Q1 2025 from Q4 2024.
*   **Stock Volatility:** Influenced by trade policies and CEO Elon Musk's activities.
*   **Analyst Outlook:** Short-term auto business challenges; long-term potential in AI, self-driving, and robotics.

**Analysis:** Recent news presents a mixed picture. Trade tensions pose a challenge, while the Cybertruck's performance suggests potential demand issues. CEO Musk's activities are a consistent source of volatility. However, analysts see long-term potential beyond the core auto business.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue decreased significantly in the most recent quarter (2025-03-31), along with a slight dip in profit margin.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been steadily increasing, but the Return on Equity (ROE) experienced a sharp decline in the most recent quarter. A low ROE suggests that Tesla is not generating significant profits from its equity. The recent decline in both revenue and ROE is a concerning trend.

### 8. Overall Analysis and Conclusion

Tesla has shown exceptional historical growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500. Its historical Alpha suggests that much of this outperformance has been due to company-specific factors, rather than general market trends. However, recent data presents a more nuanced and potentially concerning picture:

*   **Positive Signals:** The stock is in a short-term uptrend, as indicated by the price being above its moving averages, RSI shows high buying pressure. The expected return remains very high, reflecting continued optimism.
*   **Concerning Signals:** Recent earnings show a significant drop in EPS and revenue. Financial metrics reveal declining revenue and ROE in the most recent quarter, suggesting profitability challenges.  News highlights trade tensions and potential demand issues. The RSI is very high (overbought) suggesting the possibility of a price correction.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. The company's long-term potential in areas like AI and robotics remains a key factor, but the short-term challenges in its core auto business and financial performance cannot be ignored. Investors should closely monitor upcoming earnings reports and developments in trade relations and demand for Tesla's products. Considering the overbought condition, a buy-and-hold strategy should be reconsidered, and some profits may be taken.  Consider waiting for a pullback before establishing new positions. A thorough risk assessment and diversification are crucial when investing in a volatile stock like TSLA.
