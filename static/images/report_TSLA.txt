## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Tesla's cumulative return (1221.37%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (119.91%).  The difference is 1101.5 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 66.9% indicates that Tesla's performance is considerably higher than the S&P 500 compared to its historical range of divergence (max: 1673.1, min: -53.2).  However, it's crucial to note that this relative divergence doesn't imply a consistent outperformance, merely its position within its historical range.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows extremely high growth in certain periods (e.g., 1069% and 1463%), followed by significant declines (-456% and -59%). This highlights the volatility inherent in Tesla's stock.  The alpha values fluctuate, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (beta reflects market sensitivity).  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) demonstrates Tesla's growth over the years.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $404.60
* **Last Market Price:** $383.70 (a decrease of $20.90 or 5.16%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $397.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $405.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $382.52

The recent price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, hinting at a potential longer-term support level. The significant drop in the last market price indicates a sudden negative shift.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 53.81  - This suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions; the market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.77 - A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 - This confirms a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 410.2% - This high projected return, exceeding the S&P 500 significantly over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, warrants a closer examination of the underlying assumptions.  The substantial drop in the last market price (-5.16%) needs to be considered when evaluating this long-term expectation.  This sudden drop may significantly influence the projected return, which should ideally be recalculated incorporating this new data.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  While revenue remains relatively stable around $25 Billion, EPS varies.  There's a need for more data to establish clear trends.  The repetition of data entries for certain dates requires clarification (potentially data entry errors).

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock has shown periods of extraordinary growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, its volatility is a major concern. The recent price drop and bearish technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downturn. While long-term projections indicate substantial returns,  the recent market movement and the variability in earnings and profitability metrics necessitate caution.  Further investigation is required to validate the 410.2% projected return, especially considering the recent price drop. The duplicated entries in the earnings data require correction for accurate analysis.  Thorough due diligence, including considering macroeconomic factors and Tesla's specific business risks, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
