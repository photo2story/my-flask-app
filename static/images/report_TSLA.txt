**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

Tesla has demonstrated exceptional historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. This outperformance is reflected in high alpha values and substantial cumulative returns. However, the stock also exhibits significant volatility and downside risk, as indicated by the MDD.

Recent positive price action is supported by upward-trending moving averages, but the RSI suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term. The recent news and events indicate that TSLA is subject to significant market attention and volatility, requiring close monitoring of company announcements and industry trends.

The latest financial data indicates fluctuations in revenue, profit margins, EPS, and ROE. While the equity base has grown, recent profitability metrics are lower than some previous periods.

**In Summary:** TSLA presents a high-growth, high-risk investment opportunity. Its historical outperformance and expected return are attractive, but investors should be aware of the significant volatility and potential for drawdowns. Due to being overbought, a pullback might be possible. Continued monitoring of company performance, industry trends, and broader economic factors is essential for making informed investment decisions.
