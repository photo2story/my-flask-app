**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $355.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $346.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $387.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $391.53

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase (from $336.51 to $355.94) indicates a recent short-term upward movement.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.71 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.65 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.5% (Indicates short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 552.6% (Significant potential outperformance relative to the S&P 500 for long-term investors, but high risk should be noted)

The low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the negative relative divergence, align with the price being below the moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term outlook. However, the high projected long-term return highlights the potential for significant gains.  The recent price increase of 5.77% should be noted as a short-term positive development, but not necessarily indicative of a trend reversal.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some variability in EPS and revenue.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying trends and drivers of this variability.  Note the repeated values for Q1 2025 which likely represents a placeholder or a data entry error.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's historical performance shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this performance has been highly volatile, with periods of substantial gains and losses.  Current technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, with the price trading below its moving averages and showing oversold conditions.  Despite this, the projected long-term return remains high.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with Tesla, given its volatility and fluctuating profitability, before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons for the significant drop in ROE and the inconsistencies in the earnings data is necessary for a more comprehensive analysis.  The data inconsistencies require additional validation before drawing definitive conclusions.
