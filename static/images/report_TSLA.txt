2025-04-22 - Analysis Report
## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Tesla Inc., an electric vehicle and clean energy company, shows significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  However, recent price action indicates a potential bearish trend, warranting careful consideration.  While long-term projections remain positive, short-term volatility needs assessment.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla's cumulative return (2100.45%) drastically outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (72.42%). The current relative divergence of 67.5% suggests Tesla's performance is substantially higher than the S&P 500 historically, but this high divergence may indicate future volatility.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, particularly between 2018 and 2021, indicating exceptional growth. However, the Beta values, while generally low, fluctuate, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements. The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects Tesla's growth trajectory.  Note that high CAGR figures in some years are potentially unsustainable in the long term.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $227.5
* **5-day Moving Average:** $243.38
* **20-day Moving Average:** $257.07
* **60-day Moving Average:** $296.63

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The price dropped significantly from the previous close (-5.75), indicating a potential short-term decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.36 (Suggests oversold conditions, but not a strong buy signal alone)
* **PPO:** -0.1373 (Negative, confirming a bearish trend)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -7.5% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return:** 762.8% (Long-term, 2+ years, exceeding S&P 500 returns)

The combination of indicators points towards a bearish short-term outlook, but the high expected return suggests a potentially strong long-term investment opportunity. The significant price drop from the previous close strengthens the bearish short-term sentiment.  Further investigation into the cause of the price drop is recommended.
