## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1316.95%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1199.4 percentage points. The relative divergence of 72.5% indicates TSLA's performance is in the upper percentiles of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows high volatility and significant outperformance (particularly in 2018-2021) relative to the market (high alpha and varying betas). However, the 2021-2023 period shows a substantial negative CAGR, highlighting the risk associated with TSLA.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $430.60
* **Last Market Price:** $462.28 (This indicates a recent price increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $441.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $396.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $311.40

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the recent jump to $462.28 warrants further investigation for potential short-term volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.84 –  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70).
* **PPO:** -0.64 – Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -6.0 – Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 857.5% – This projects a substantial outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if current trends continue.  This should be viewed with caution given the historical volatility shown in the CAGR data. The significant jump from Last Market to Closing price requires further examination.  The drop in price could be attributed to profit-taking, or a temporary market correction,  but requires further analysis beyond the provided data.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some volatility in both revenue and EPS. Revenue has been relatively stable around $25B for the last two quarters after a dip in Q1 2024. EPS showed an increase from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024 and Q3 2024, but overall trend is not clearly upward.  There is a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24.  Without more information, we cannot assess whether these results beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue has been relatively stable, though Q1 2024 shows a dip.  Profit margin is relatively consistent, hovering around 18%. Equity has shown growth but the ROE is highly volatile, with a significant jump in Q4 2023 followed by a sharp decrease in subsequent quarters. This volatility requires deeper investigation into the company's financial health and strategy.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information regarding recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided.  This information is crucial for a complete analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has historically demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, this outperformance is accompanied by substantial volatility. Recent price movements suggest a possible upward trend, but the RSI is nearing overbought territory, and the PPO is negative, suggesting caution. While the expected return is high, the significant volatility shown both in price and financial statements necessitates a deep dive into current market sentiment, analyst reports, and news impacting Tesla to assess the true risk/reward ratio.  The missing news and analysis items severely limit the completeness of this assessment. The provided data strongly suggests caution, emphasizing the risk associated with TSLA's high growth and volatility.  The last market price being substantially higher than the closing price raises serious questions about short term volatility.


**8.  Recommendations:**

A comprehensive analysis requires additional data, including:

* **Missing News and Analyst Opinions:** Access to recent news articles, analyst ratings, and market sentiment analysis is vital for determining the current market perception of TSLA.
* **Earnings Expectations:** Comparing reported EPS and revenue to analyst expectations would provide a clearer picture of the company's performance.
* **Further Financial Statement Analysis:**  More detailed financial information, including cash flow statements, debt levels, and a comprehensive review of the ROE fluctuations is needed.


Given the data provided and its limitations, a strong recommendation cannot be given. However,  the existing data strongly suggests  TSLA's performance is highly volatile and carries significant risk. A thorough investigation beyond the information provided is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
