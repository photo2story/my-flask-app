## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA (1187.93%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (37.39%) over the analyzed period. The difference in cumulative returns is 1150.54%. The relative divergence of 57.7% indicates TSLA's performance is considerably higher than the S&P 500, relative to its historical range of performance differences.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $394.36
* **Last Market Price:** $395.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $399.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $425.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $337.06

The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (36.18):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-2.48):** Indicates a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-6.0%):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance.

The current market price ($395.35) being close to the closing price doesn't suggest significant immediate upward or downward movement.  The expected return of 599.6% represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investors.  This high expected return is contingent upon the significant volatility displayed in the historical data.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally been high, with a slight dip in Q1 2024.  However,  there is no clear consistent upward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS also displays fluctuation, with the highest value in Q4 2024, followed by a decrease.  There's no straightforward upward or downward trend to conclude from this data.

There is a discrepancy in the table. Two entries are listed for October 24, 2024, one reporting EPS of 0.68 and the other reporting 0.58.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile these conflicting data points. Without knowing the expectations, it's impossible to assess whether these results "beat" or "missed" expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows fluctuations.  Profit margins are relatively stable around 18%, with a slight increase in Q3 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows a general increase.  ROE is highly volatile, with significant swings.  The exceptionally high ROE in Q4 2023 needs further analysis to understand its drivers.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500. However, this is coupled with high volatility and significant swings in both revenue and EPS. While the stock is currently trading below its moving averages and showing some oversold signals (RSI), the long-term expected return remains high.  The high volatility and inconsistent financial metrics warrant caution.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of both the extraordinary return and the volatility, particularly within the most recent quarter.  Reconciling the conflicting earnings data for October 24, 2024, and gaining insight into analyst opinions and market sentiment is crucial for a more comprehensive evaluation. The analysis is limited by the incompleteness of the provided data, specifically the lack of recent news and market sentiment.
