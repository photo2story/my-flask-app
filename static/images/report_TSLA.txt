**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows TSLA significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return vastly exceeding that of the index.  However, the high relative divergence should be interpreted cautiously, as it only reflects the historical range of the performance difference, not a guaranteed future outperformance.  The CAGR data in the table below shows wildly fluctuating performance year over year.  Note that the Beta values are consistently near 0, suggesting little correlation with the broader market.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 34.0%    | 14.2%    | 5.0%   | 0.0   |        |
| 2016-2018  | 46.0%    | 21.0%    | 28.0%  | 0.3   |        |
| 2017-2019  | 48.0%    | 21.0%    | 18.0%  | 0.9   |        |
| 2018-2020  | 1069.0%  | 21.1%    | 1042.0%| 0.2   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 1463.0%  | 21.1%    | 1393.0%| 0.1   |        |
| 2020-2022  | 238.0%   | 36.6%    | 229.0% | 0.2   |        |
| 2021-2023  | -456.0%  | 36.6%    | -479.0%| 0.8   |        |
| 2022-2024  | -59.0%   | 36.6%    | -92.0% | 0.8   |        |
| 2023-2025  | 463.0%   | 24.5%    | 400.0% | 1.1   |        |


The extremely high CAGR and Alpha values in some years are noteworthy, suggesting periods of significant outperformance. However, the substantial negative CAGR in 2021-2023 highlights the significant volatility inherent in TSLA.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $354.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $346.18
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $380.95
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $392.37

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 35.03 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.99 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.5 (Short-term upward movement, but in context of overall trends it is limited)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 558.9% (This is a very high expected return and should be viewed with skepticism.  It is highly dependent on many factors and past performance is not indicative of future results.)

The low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish sentiment.  The positive relative divergence change shows a minor recent upward trend, but the overall picture is less bullish considering the moving average analysis.  The exceedingly high projected return needs careful consideration given the inherent volatility of TSLA.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18 Billion |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18 Billion |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46 | $25.50 Billion |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.46 | $25.50 Billion |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30 Billion |

The data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue, but more data points would be needed for a comprehensive analysis.  The repetition of data points requires clarification of its accuracy.


**5. Financial Information:**

No Total Revenue or Gross Profit data is available.  This significantly limits the ability to perform a thorough fundamental analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's performance has been highly volatile, exhibiting periods of extreme outperformance and significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While the cumulative return is remarkably high,  the significant negative CAGR in recent years, low RSI, negative PPO, and the price being below its moving averages paint a currently cautious picture.  The lack of key financial data further hinders a comprehensive assessment.  The extremely high projected return is speculative and not a reliable predictor of future performance.  Further analysis, including examination of financial statements and industry trends, is necessary for a more robust evaluation.  The high volatility also makes it crucial to manage risk effectively if considering investment.
