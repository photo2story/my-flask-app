*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, indicating that TSLA's price movements are not strongly correlated with the S&P 500.  The beta has been increasing, suggesting correlation with the overall market is getting stronger.

### 3. Recent Price Action:

*   **Current Price:** 438.369
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 434.88, Previous Close: 443.21, Change: -1.88%

    *   5-day: 436.79
    *   20-day: 394.38
    *   60-day: 347.33

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. However, the recent price decrease of -1.88% compared to the previous close and a very slight price decrease(438.369 -> 434.88) indicates there might be some short-term selling pressure. The 20-day moving average significantly below the 5-day average shows a strong upward trend in the recent past.

*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 80.01 (Overbought)

*   The recent price decrease may reflect sensitivity to news.

### 5. Recent News & Significant Events:

*   **Positive:** Analyst price target increases to $490 (from multiple sources) suggest continued optimism.

*   **General:** News about Tesla China's Q3 performance and DoorDash's autonomous delivery robots may have tangential effects.

*   **Target Price:** Avg: $345.50, High: $600.00, Low: $115.00

The average target price is significantly below the current price, suggesting potential downside risk according to consensus estimates.

    *   RSI in overbought territory signals short-term risk of pullback.
    *   Analyst consensus is "Hold" with an average target price below the current price.
    *   Recent decline in ROE is concerning.

*   **Recommendation:**

    *   **Long-term investors:** Given the high expected return and Tesla's history of outperformance, a long-term investment strategy (2+ years) with regular accumulation may be considered, but careful monitoring of financial performance is crucial.
    *   **Short-term traders:** Be cautious due to the overbought RSI and recent price volatility. A potential pullback could offer a better entry point.
    *   **Overall:** The analyst consensus target price below the current price shows Tesla's market price could be very overpriced.

This analysis provides a balanced view of Tesla, highlighting both its strengths and potential risks. Investors should consider their own risk tolerance and investment horizon when making decisions.
