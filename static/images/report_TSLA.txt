## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The cumulative return of TSLA is 1316.95%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1199.4 percentage points.  This places TSLA at the 72.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided range of maximum and minimum divergence.  The high alpha values in the provided data, particularly in the 2018-2021 period, highlight significant outperformance relative to the market (represented by the beta). However, the significant negative CAGR in 2021-2023 shows substantial volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $430.60
* **Last Market Price:** $462.28 (This suggests a recent price increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $441.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $396.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $311.40

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, though the recent jump to $462.28 warrants further investigation.  The significant difference between the short-term (5-day) and longer-term (60-day) moving averages indicates substantial price volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 68.84 – This suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.64 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -6.0 – Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 857.5% –  This represents a significant potential for outperformance over the S&P 500 with long-term (2+ years) investment, given the provided data.  However, this projection should be viewed with caution, considering the volatility evidenced in the historical data.  The increase to $462.28 could indicate a short-term price surge, possibly influenced by market sentiment or news events.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data reveals some inconsistencies.  There is a duplicate entry for October 24th, 2024.  Assuming the second entry is an error, the analysis is as follows:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates.  Q2 2024 showed a slight decrease compared to Q1 2024, but Q3 2024 showed a significant increase over Q2 2024. Overall revenue trend doesn't show a consistent upward trajectory.
* **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS also fluctuates, showing no clear upward trend. Q3 2024 shows the highest EPS.
* **Significant Changes:** The most significant changes are observed in the revenue and EPS fluctuations quarter to quarter.  Notably, there is no indication of whether these results exceeded or fell short of expectations.  Further information is needed to evaluate this aspect of performance.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some volatility, but generally remains high. Profit margins are relatively consistent, ranging from 17.35% to 19.84%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has increased over time, although there is a notable dip in ROE (Return on Equity) in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.  This suggests a potential decrease in profitability relative to invested capital during these periods.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying causes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent issues within the past two days are provided.  The absence of this information limits the analysis.  Current market outlook and analyst opinions are also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with considerable volatility. Recent price movements indicate a potential upward trend, but the RSI suggests a possible correction.  The company shows high revenue and generally consistent profit margins. However, significant quarterly fluctuations in revenue, EPS, and ROE reveal underlying volatility.  Further investigation is necessary to determine if the recent jump in price to $462.28 is sustainable and if the long-term expected return of 857.5% is realistic.  Missing crucial information—recent news, analyst opinions, and comparisons to expectations—limits the completeness of this analysis.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the substantial historical volatility and the recent price increase without supporting news, a cautious approach is recommended.  Thorough due diligence, including analysis of recent news, analyst reports, and a deeper understanding of the factors driving the recent price surge, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return should be treated with significant skepticism due to the inherent risks associated with TSLA's historical performance.  Long-term investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance before investing in this volatile stock.
