**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns for TSLA compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **TSLA Cumulative Return:** 1221.37%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 119.91%
* **Return Difference:** 1101.46%  (This indicates TSLA significantly outperformed VOO, but the relative divergence metric should be considered for context.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 66.9% (This signifies TSLA's performance is in the upper 66.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  It doesn't imply consistent outperformance.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and varying performance depending on the period.  The exceptionally high CAGR in some periods (e.g., 2018-2020, 2019-2021) is contrasted by significant negative returns in others (e.g., 2021-2023). Market capitalization (Cap(B)) steadily increased throughout the observed periods.  Further investigation into the drivers behind these fluctuations is crucial.

The significant positive price change from the previous close requires consideration when evaluating this long-term estimate.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some consistency in EPS and revenue across different quarters. However, there are two identical entries (2024-10-24 and 2025-01-30, same figures) suggesting potential data entry errors.  A more reliable data source should be consulted.  Further analysis would benefit from more detailed breakdowns of earnings components and comparison to previous years.

This requires further investigation into the underlying factors.


| Quarter    | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Tesla's stock shows periods of exceptional growth significantly outperforming the S&P 500, but also periods of substantial losses.  The high volatility and inconsistent performance across different periods necessitates a cautious approach to investment.  While the long-term expected return is high, this should be viewed with skepticism given the historical volatility and the need to address data inconsistencies and further clarify the assumptions underlying the expected return calculation.  Thorough due diligence, considering macroeconomic factors and future industry trends, is vital before making any investment decisions.  The provided data suggests a need for more robust and consistent data sources for a complete and accurate analysis.
