*(This section requires real-time information gathering from sources like Shacknews, Finbold, and other financial news outlets.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's historical performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, showing exceptionally high growth in previous years.  However, recent performance has been more muted.  While technical indicators suggest some bullish momentum, the price is currently trading below its key moving averages.  The financial statements reveal fluctuating revenue, EPS, and ROE.  A comprehensive analysis requires deeper examination of its earnings reports, analyst opinions, and a thorough comparison with competitor performance. The predicted long-term outperformance of the S&P 500, even with recent softening, may still be attractive to long-term investors with risk tolerance for higher volatility.  However, investors should closely monitor news and developments regarding Tesla's financial results, industry competition, and regulatory landscape before making any investment decisions.
