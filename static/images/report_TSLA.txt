## TSLA Stock Report

**1. Relative Performance vs. S&P 500:**

Tesla Inc. (TSLA), an American multinational automotive and clean energy company, significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  TSLA's cumulative return is 1479.01%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) returned 120.85%, resulting in a difference of 1358.16%.  The relative strength index suggests TSLA's performance is in the 81.7th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.  Alpha consistently outperformed the market, especially between 2018-2021. However, recent performance (2021-2023) shows a substantial negative return and negative alpha.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

TSLA's closing price is $479.86.  Short-term momentum appears strong, with the 5-day moving average ($444.40) and 20-day moving average ($378.65) both below the current price. The stock has seen a significant upward trend recently, exceeding its 60-day moving average ($299.70) by a considerable margin.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 90.01 - Extremely overbought, suggesting a potential pullback.
* PPO: 1.718 - Positive, indicating upward momentum, though the high RSI warrants caution.
* Relative Strength Delta (20-day): +15.0 -  Confirms the recent strong price increase relative to the S&P 500.
* Expected Return: 753.0% -  Highly optimistic long-term (2+ years) projected outperformance against the S&P 500. This should be viewed with caution given recent volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* Latest Quarter (2024-10-24): EPS $0.68, Revenue $25.18B
* Previous Quarter (2024-07-24): EPS $0.46, Revenue $25.50B
* Two Quarters Prior (2024-04-24): EPS $0.37, Revenue $21.30B

Revenue shows an overall growth trend. EPS has fluctuated but increased in the most recent quarter. There's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24 and 2023-10-23 with the same EPS and revenue figures, suggesting a possible data error. Without external data on expectations, it's impossible to determine if these results represent beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* Revenue has generally increased, but slightly declined from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024.
* Profit margin shows a positive trend, increasing each quarter from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024.
* ROE fluctuates significantly. A notable high of 12.66% in Q4 2023 was followed by a significant drop and gradual recovery.
* Equity has consistently grown.

**6. News and Recent Events:**

Information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is not provided.  This information is crucial for a complete analysis.

**7. Summary:**

TSLA has demonstrated significant historical outperformance against the S&P 500, coupled with high alpha. Recent price action shows strong upward momentum, but technical indicators like RSI point to the stock being overbought. While revenue and profit margins show positive trends, ROE is volatile.  The extremely high expected return projection requires careful consideration given recent performance fluctuations and the overbought condition.  Lack of news and analyst sentiment prevents a fully comprehensive assessment.

**8. Recommendation:**

Further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and market outlook is necessary before making any investment decisions. The high RSI suggests caution despite positive momentum and growth trends.  The disparity between recent negative returns (2021-2023) and the highly optimistic long-term projected return necessitates careful evaluation.
