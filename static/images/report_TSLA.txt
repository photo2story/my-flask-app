## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:** Tesla Inc., an electric vehicle and clean energy company, exhibits significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods. While recent price action shows a decline from recent highs, long-term projections suggest substantial outperformance compared to the benchmark index.  However, volatility is a key characteristic.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla's cumulative return of 2160.75% vastly outperforms the S&P 500's 57.05% cumulative return.  The difference (2103.7 percentage points) places it at the 69.6th percentile of its historical range (max: 3050.7, min: -60.4).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly variable performance across different time periods.  While the company consistently displays a beta significantly higher than 1, indicating higher volatility than the market, the alpha (outperformance) varies considerably, fluctuating between significantly positive and slightly negative values, highlighting the substantial risk associated with Tesla's stock.  The substantial increases in market capitalization over the analyzed period are notable.

**2) Recent Price Action:**

The current closing price is $233.735. The last market price shows a slight increase ($234.5477) from the previous close ($233.29).  However, all moving averages are significantly higher than the current price, suggesting a downward trend:

* **5-day MA:** $258.333
* **20-day MA:** $253.9787
* **60-day MA:** $321.6232


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** 0.56 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum, although it needs context from the chart).
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -8.0% (Short-term bearish signal).
* **Price Change:**  The slight increase in price from the previous close ({'price': 234.5477, 'previousClose': 233.29, 'change': 0.54}) is not significant enough to qualify as a sharp rebound or decline.
* **Expected Return:** 717.1%  This extremely high projected return over the long term (2+ years) needs careful consideration, considering inherent volatility.  This implies a substantial outperformance against the S&P 500.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Tesla shows remarkable long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this comes with considerable volatility, as evidenced by the high beta, fluctuating alpha, and significant price swings.  The recent price decline and high market risk indicator suggest caution.  While long-term projections point towards substantial outperformance, investors should be prepared for periods of significant risk. Further analysis incorporating broader market conditions, competitive landscape, and detailed financial modeling is recommended before making investment decisions.  The high projected returns are very optimistic and highly dependent on continued growth.  The high volatility suggests considering a diversified portfolio to mitigate risk.
