**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for TSLA across various periods, substantially exceeding the market (as indicated by a positive alpha).  However, the high beta suggests higher volatility than the market. Note the significant increase in both CAGR and Alpha from 2018 onwards, reflecting Tesla's rapid growth during that time.  The decrease in beta in 2023 might be due to several factors such as decreased market volatility or specific events related to Tesla.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some variation in EPS and revenue across quarters.  More consistent data would be needed for a more thorough analysis.  However, the relatively stable EPS and fluctuating revenue suggest areas requiring further investigation.  Note the repeated values for specific quarters - requires clarification on whether this is an error or a reporting peculiarity.

|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18B     |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla has demonstrated exceptional growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this comes with significant volatility (high beta).  While long-term prospects appear positive, indicated by a high expected return, the recent price movement and some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction.  Further investigation is needed into the repeated earnings data and the significant drop in ROE in Q4 2023 to provide a comprehensive assessment.  The high projected return is based on historical data and doesn't guarantee future performance; careful risk management is crucial.
