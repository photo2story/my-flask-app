## Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review

Tesla Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Tesla's cumulative return (813.94%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (112.87%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 701.1%, placing it at the 43.7th percentile of historical divergence (relative to the min/max range of -53.2% to 1673.1%).

The provided alpha and beta values show varying performance characteristics across different time periods.  While high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values are observed in several years (reaching 1463% in 2019-2021),  the substantial negative CAGR in 2021-2023 highlights the volatility of the stock.  The beta values fluctuate, indicating varying sensitivity to the overall market.  It's noteworthy that the high CAGR periods coincide with periods of significantly high maximum drawdown (MDD), emphasizing the risk associated with Tesla's stock.  The large market capitalization (Cap(B)) also reflects Tesla's significant size and influence in the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $281.95
* **5-day moving average:** $308.78
* **20-day moving average:** $351.77
* **60-day moving average:** $390.19

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend. The recent price change (-$3.04) indicates a short-term decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 21.16 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -2.11 – Suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -13.1% –  This confirms a recent short-term downward trend.

The significant price drop indicated by `Last-market` reinforces the bearish sentiment indicated by the RSI and PPO, suggesting a potential continuation of the downward trend.

The expected return of 876.6% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 implies a substantial outperformance potential if the historical trend were to continue.  However, given the substantial volatility previously experienced, this forecast should be treated with significant caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some consistency in EPS and revenue over the last few quarters, though there's a noticeable dip in revenue in Q1 2024. This consistency needs further investigation to determine if it reflects sustained performance or cyclical trends within the business.  More detailed analysis and comparison to previous periods are needed for a comprehensive evaluation.


| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.68 | $25.18B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.68 | $25.18B      |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.46 | $25.50B      |
| 2025-01-30 | $0.46 | $25.50B      |
| 2024-04-24 | $0.37 | $21.30B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information shows fluctuating revenue and profit margins, suggesting inconsistent performance. The ROE (Return on Equity) experienced a significant drop in Q2 2024 and Q1 2024, needing further analysis to understand the underlying reasons for these changes. A high ROE in Q4 2023 contrasts sharply with subsequent quarters.  Further investigation into the financial health and growth prospects is required.

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE     |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $25.71B   | 16.26%        | $72.91B   | 3.23%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $25.18B   | 19.84%        | $69.93B   | 3.10%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $25.50B   | 17.95%        | $66.47B   | 2.22%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.30B   | 17.35%        | $64.38B   | 1.75%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $25.17B   | 17.63%        | $62.63B   | 12.66%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Tesla's stock shows a history of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this has come with substantial volatility and risk. Current indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) suggest a bearish trend.  While long-term projections indicate significant potential,  recent price movements and financial data show some cause for concern.  A thorough fundamental analysis, examining factors such as competition, future product launches, and macroeconomic conditions, is crucial to assess Tesla's long-term prospects.  The provided data alone is insufficient for a conclusive investment recommendation.  Further investigation is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
