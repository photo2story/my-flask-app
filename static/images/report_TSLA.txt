**6. Overall Analysis:**

TSLA has historically shown remarkable growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent performance indicates increased volatility. The high expected long-term return should be treated cautiously, considering the inherent risk associated with such high-growth stocks. While the stock is currently trading below its moving averages and showing some bearish signals (PPO, relative divergence), the oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce.  A comprehensive analysis requires further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and a deeper dive into the factors driving the significant fluctuations in CAGR and ROE.  The high projected long-term return must be considered in conjunction with the considerable risk involved.  Investors should perform their own due diligence before making any investment decisions.
