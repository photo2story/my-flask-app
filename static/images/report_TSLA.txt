* **Closing Price:** $389.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $365.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $343.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $276.89

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The distance between the closing price and the moving averages indicates increasing momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (75.97):**  Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (0.06):**  A positive value indicates bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+7.8):** Shows a recent short-term increase in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (936.1%):** This high projected return over the long term (2+ years) significantly surpasses the expected return of the S&P 500, but requires a high risk tolerance.  The disclaimer emphasizes that this is an estimate and subject to market fluctuations.  A 936.1% return projection warrants careful consideration due to its magnitude.  The closing price of $389.38, being higher than other recent values, supports the assumption of recent uptrend. However, such rapid appreciation may lead to a potential price correction.
