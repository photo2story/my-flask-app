## TEM: Unknown Company Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

TEM stock shows significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While the absolute return is impressive, the high volatility and potentially unsustainable growth trajectory warrant a cautious approach. Negative EPS and fluctuating profitability metrics raise concerns. Further investigation into the underlying business model and future growth prospects is crucial.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **Company Overview:** (Insert a one-line company overview here.  This information was not provided.)
* **TEM Cumulative Return:** 105.86%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 19.27%
* **Return Difference (TEM - VOO):** 86.6%
* **Relative Deviation:** 97.4% (This indicates TEM's performance is at the 97.4th percentile relative to its historical range of performance against the VOO.)

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 110.0% | 41.0% | 92.0% | 14.1 |

The extremely high Alpha (92.0%) suggests significant outperformance relative to the market benchmark, while the high Beta (14.1) signifies substantial volatility and sensitivity to market movements. This combination of high alpha and high beta warrants careful consideration of risk tolerance.  The exceptionally high CAGR (110%) should be viewed with skepticism without understanding the underlying drivers.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $89.44
* **Previous Close:** $83.75
* **Daily Change:** $6.79 (8.1%) - *Significant daily increase, indicating a recent surge.*
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $77.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $61.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $49.92

The price is significantly above all moving averages, suggesting potential overbought conditions.  The recent sharp increase necessitates careful consideration of potential pullback.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 88.08 (Overbought territory, suggesting a potential price correction.)
* **PPO:** 3.56 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but in context of RSI and other factors, not a decisive signal.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 34.3% (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** NaN.  The extremely high short-term gains are unlikely to be sustainable.  Given the volatility, projecting long-term expected returns is challenging without in-depth fundamental analysis and understanding of the business model.  A long-term, S&P 500-relative outperformance cannot be assumed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS       | Expected EPS |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2024-11-04 | -$0.25    | -$0.26608    |
| 2024-08-06 | -$0.63    | -$0.59       |

Negative EPS in both quarters indicates losses. While the November 2024 EPS slightly beat expectations, the company is currently unprofitable.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons for these losses.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.18B  | 58.50%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.17B  | 45.50%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.15B  | 53.28%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.15B  | 55.20%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.14B  | 54.41%       |

Revenue is growing steadily, though at a modest rate. Profit margins are generally high but exhibit some fluctuation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE          |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.05B   | -141.16%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.10B   | -562.04%     |
| 2024-03-31 | -$1.47B  | 4.39%        |
| 2023-12-31 | -$1.38B  | 3.65%        |
| 2023-09-30 | -$1.32B  | 4.03%        |

Negative equity in several quarters raises significant concerns about the company's financial health. The extremely negative ROE values in Q2 and Q3 2024 are alarming and require further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM exhibits extraordinary returns compared to the S&P 500, driven by a high CAGR and Alpha. However, this performance is accompanied by substantial volatility (high Beta), negative EPS, fluctuating profitability, and concerning negative equity. The recent sharp price increase, coupled with overbought technical indicators, suggests a high risk of a price correction.  While the revenue growth is positive, the financial health of the company is questionable given the negative equity and volatile ROE.  Further fundamental analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of its performance and assess the long-term investment viability.  The current situation requires a very cautious approach and in-depth due diligence.  Without a thorough understanding of the underlying business and its future prospects,  the extremely high short-term gains are unsustainable and potentially dangerous for investors.
