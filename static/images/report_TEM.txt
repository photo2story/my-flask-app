*   **Company:** Unknown Company (details to be added)
*   **Description:** A one-line company overview will be added once found.
*   **TEM Cumulative Return:** 56.43%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 23.19%

**Analysis:**

TEM has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) since its inception. The current cumulative return difference is substantial.  A relative spread of 41.9 indicates that the current outperformance is in the middle range of its historical performance compared to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 2023-2025  | 56.0% | 75.0% | 34.0% | -0.1 | 15.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A high CAGR of 56.0% indicates very strong growth over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  A very high MDD of 75.0% signifies substantial risk and volatility.  Investors should be prepared for significant potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** A positive alpha of 34.0% suggests that TEM has outperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.  It has generated excess returns.
*   **Beta:** A negative beta of -0.1 suggests a slight *inverse* correlation with the market. In theory, TEM might move slightly in the opposite direction of the S&P 500, though the effect is minimal.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** $15 Billion, indicating a mid-cap company.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $86.38
*   **Previous Close:** $88.78
*   **Change:** -$2.40 (-2.7%)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 82.91
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 77.86
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 66.98

**Analysis:**

The stock price closed lower today, down -2.7%. The current price is above all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 day), which is generally a bullish signal.  However, the pullback today, after positive recent news, warrants observation.  The fact that the 5-day moving average is above the 20-day, and the 20-day is above the 60-day further supports a short-term bullish trend.

**3. Market Risk Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.32 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.38
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.587
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (2 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)"
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** 2.7% (positive - indicating short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** NaN

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.32 suggests a *low* level of market risk associated with TEM at this time.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 58.38 is in neutral territory, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, confirming the recent uptrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a moderate "Buy" recommendation, utilizing 80% of available cash. The "Caution" flag, tied to the MRI, implies a level of consideration regarding the risk.
*   **Recent Relative Spread Change:** The positive change in relative spread indicates the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 slightly over the last 20 days.
*   **Expected Return:** The "NaN" value for expected return is problematic. It means we have no prediction for long-term outperformance versus the S&P 500.

The recent price drop of -2.7% is a significant one-day move. The news headlines suggest this might be a short-term pullback after a substantial run-up due to positive catalysts (FDA approval).

*   **Key Themes:** Recent FDA approval for Pixel technology, integration of Tempus AI's clinical assistant into Northwestern Medicine's EHR platform, and subsequent stock price surges.
*   **Overall Sentiment:** Highly positive.  The news suggests significant advancements and market recognition.

**Analysis:**

The recent news is overwhelmingly positive, centered around FDA approval and adoption of Tempus AI's technology. These are concrete events that are likely driving the recent stock price increase. The news articles frame this as a significant step forward for the company.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue is growing consistently quarter-over-quarter, which is a very positive sign.
*   **Profit Margin:** The profit margin is exceptionally high and stable, above 60% for recent quarters, indicating strong pricing power and cost management. The jump from 45.5% to over 58% is particularly noteworthy.
*   **Equity:** Equity is volatile.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is negative, reflecting the company's current unprofitability. The very large negative ROE values in the past indicate significant losses relative to shareholder equity. ROE improving is a positive trend, but still far from positive.

**7. Overall Summary**

TEM is a rapidly growing company with strong revenue growth and exceptionally high profit margins.  It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but exhibits high volatility (high MDD). Recent FDA approval and partnerships are driving positive momentum. Analyst consensus is bullish, although the current stock price exceeds their average target. The company is currently unprofitable, but it is consistently beating earnings estimates. The stock exhibits low market risk according to the MRI index. The recent price drop of 2.7% could be a temporary correction after a large surge. The NaN for the expected return should be investigated.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Volatility:**  The high MDD means this is not a stock for risk-averse investors.
*   **Profitability:** While revenue growth and profit margins are excellent, the company needs to become profitable to justify its current valuation long-term.
*   **Analyst Target Prices:** Pay attention to whether analysts revise their target prices upward to reflect the recent positive news and stock price increase.
*   **Future Growth:** The company's future success depends on continued innovation, market adoption of its technologies, and successful execution of its business strategy.
