    | Year      | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
    | :---------- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- | :----- |
    | 2023-2025 | 20.0% | 75.0% | 7.0%  | -0.0 | 10.0  |

    *   **Beta:** -0.0. TEM doesn't move as much as the benchmark.
    *   **Cap:** $10B.

    *Analysis:* While TEM has outperformed VOO (positive alpha), the high MDD (75.0%) signals substantial risk.  The current spread is relatively low, suggesting recent underperformance relative to its historical pattern.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** \$58.0081
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: \$58.0163, Previous Close: \$58.51, Change: -0.84 (-0.84%). Recent negative change indicates immediate downward pressure.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day MA: \$59.12
    *   20-day MA: \$66.13
    *   60-day MA: \$59.02

    *Analysis:* The price is below the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a short-term and intermediate-term downtrend. The fact that the price dropped by -0.84 from the previous close is a further indicator of recent downward movement.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Return Expectations**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3373 (Low Risk).
*   **RSI:** 25.51 (Oversold).
*   **PPO:** -2.36 (Below Zero Line: Downtrend).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_69%_Sell 1.2% of holdings (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) (Cash Ratio: 69% on 2025-06-24). This signal suggests holding a large cash position and reducing exposure to the stock. The MRI value reinforces a cautious approach.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** -7.4 (Negative Change: Short-term Decline). Confirms recent underperformance relative to VOO.
*   **Expected Return (%):** NaN (No reliable long-term return projection available).

    *Analysis:* The RSI indicates TEM is oversold, which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity. However, the PPO confirms a downtrend, and the hybrid signal strongly advises caution. The declining relative spread and the "NaN" expected return further complicate the investment outlook. The fact that {'price': 58.0163, 'previousClose': 58.51, 'change': -0.84} data is showing price decreasing with some volatility.

| 2024-03-31 | -$1.47B   | 4.39%     |

*Analysis:* Revenue is generally increasing, and profit margins are relatively high. However, the consistently negative ROE values are concerning. The significant changes in equity, particularly the negative value in 2024-03-31, warrant further investigation.

**7. Overall Summary**

TEM (Unknown Company) presents a mixed picture. While it has demonstrated past outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), the high maximum drawdown indicates significant risk. Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, and technical indicators lean towards caution. Earnings are consistently negative, but revenue is growing, and profit margins are strong. The negative ROE, especially with negative equity in one quarter, is a major red flag. Recent news indicates uncertainty and volatility.

**Overall Recommendation:** Due to the high risk, negative earnings, negative ROE, and the general caution advised by the hybrid signal, investing in TEM at this time is **NOT RECOMMENDED** without further, in-depth due diligence. Investors should closely monitor news, earnings reports, and company announcements. If any investment, I would recommend small portion and only with money that you can lose.
