## TEM: Unknown Company Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

TEM, an Unknown Company, shows a positive cumulative return of 4.21% compared to a -7.29% return for the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  However, recent price action suggests a downward trend, with key indicators like RSI and PPO signaling bearish momentum.  While profitability metrics are relatively strong, negative ROE raises concerns about the company's capital efficiency.  Further investigation into the underlying business model and future growth prospects is necessary.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

TEM's cumulative return of 4.214% significantly outperformed the S&P 500's -7.289% return.  The provided relative divergence of 26.3% indicates TEM's performance is relatively strong compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500, but this is relative to its own past volatility against the S&P 500, not an absolute measure of outperformance.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 4.0% | 85.1% | 12.0% | -0.1 | 7.0 |

**Analysis:** A 4.0% CAGR is modest,  a high maximum drawdown (MDD) of 85.1% indicates significant risk, and a negative beta (-0.1) suggests low correlation with the market.  An alpha of 12.0% shows significant outperformance relative to the benchmark used in its calculation, although the context and methodology of the Alpha calculation is unspecified.  A market capitalization of 7 billion is substantial.


**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $40.45
* **5-day MA:** $41.90
* **20-day MA:** $46.48
* **60-day MA:** $55.07

The stock price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price drop of $1.0 (-1.0%) from the previous close reinforces this negative trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.67 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions but not a strong buy signal)
* **PPO:** -0.4584 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.7 (Short-term upward movement but currently overridden by the longer term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** nan (Not provided,  long-term investment potential requires deeper fundamental analysis).

The recent price drop of $1.0 signals a potential short-term bearish trend, but this should not be used in isolation to determine future prices.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2025-02-24 | -0.18   | -0.15        |
| 2024-11-04 | -0.25   | -0.26608     |
| 2024-08-06 | -0.63   | -0.59        |

TEM has reported negative EPS in the last three quarters, although it beat earnings expectations in two out of three quarters.  The trend suggests that the company has not yet turned a profit, although there is some improvement in recent earnings compared to earlier quarters.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.20B | 60.83%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.18B | 58.50%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.17B | 45.50%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.15B | 53.28%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.15B | 55.20%       |

Revenue is growing, and profit margins are generally high, although showing some recent volatility.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE        |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B  | -23.10%     |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.05B  | -141.16%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.10B  | -562.04%    |
| 2024-03-31 | $-1.47B | 4.39%      |
| 2023-12-31 | $-1.38B | 3.65%      |

Negative ROE in the last three quarters is extremely concerning, indicating inefficient use of capital.  This warrants further investigation into the company's financial health and strategic direction.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM shows a strong relative performance against the S&P 500 in the past, with high profit margins and growing revenue.  However, the recent price action, negative EPS, and severely negative ROE raise significant concerns.  The high MDD highlights the inherent risk in this investment.  Before considering investment,  a thorough understanding of the underlying business, the causes of negative ROE, and future growth prospects is crucial.  The current technical indicators suggest caution.  More detailed financial statements and a deeper dive into the company's business model are needed to assess the long-term investment potential.
