**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE           |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.05B      | -141.16%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.10B      | -562.04%      |

| 2023-09-30 | -$1.32B     | 4.03%         |

The extremely negative ROE in Q2 and Q3 2024 is a major red flag, indicating significant issues with profitability relative to equity.  This drastically outweighs the positive revenue growth and profit margins.  Further investigation is crucial to understand the cause of this.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TEM has shown strong recent performance relative to the S&P 500, but this is heavily influenced by a recent sharp price drop. While revenue and profit margins appear positive, the extremely negative ROE raises serious concerns regarding the company's financial health and long-term sustainability. The high RSI and recent price drop suggest a potential period of consolidation or correction is imminent.  The negative EPS and highly volatile ROE strongly suggest further investigation into the fundamental health of the company is needed before considering any investment.  The reported CAGR should be viewed with extreme caution given the recent negative developments.  A more thorough due diligence process is required before drawing any definitive conclusions.
