2025-05-11 - Analysis Report
## TEM (Unknown Company) Stock Analysis Report

**Executive Summary:** TEM shows strong recent cumulative returns (45.8%), significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (-0.89%).  However, this performance is accompanied by high volatility and negative profitability metrics, raising concerns about sustainability.  Recent price action shows a sharp decline, and negative EPS results warrant careful consideration.  Further investigation into the underlying business model and future prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

TEM's cumulative return of 45.82% vastly outperforms the S&P 500's -0.89% cumulative return. The relative divergence of 46.7 places it in the upper quartile (53.5% quantile) of its historical range against the S&P 500, indicating a significant outperformance historically.  However, the high beta (10.6) suggests significant market sensitivity. The negative alpha (-0.1) indicates underperformance relative to the market after adjusting for risk.  The Unknown Company needs further investigation to understand this large discrepancy between raw return and risk-adjusted return.  The provided CAGR of 46% over 2023-2025 should be viewed cautiously due to the lack of information about underlying business activities. A 75% Maximum Drawdown (MDD) signals considerable risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is 65.22, but the last market price is 61.37, a significant drop of -5.9%.  This highlights considerable price volatility.  The short-term trends (5-day, 20-day, 60-day moving averages) indicate a downward trend: 5-day MA (57.46) < 20-day MA (49.44) < 60-day MA (53.38). The recent drop could indicate a significant shift in market sentiment.  The large negative price change necessitates further investigation into triggering factors.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI (80.24) is extremely overbought, suggesting the stock is significantly overvalued in the short term and potentially vulnerable to a correction. The PPO (3.22) also points towards overbought conditions. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.37 suggests a medium risk level. The 20-day relative divergence increase of 22.1% points to recent strong upward movement, but this is potentially unsustainable given the other indicators. The expected return is `nan`, indicating that no long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is provided. The high RSI and significant price drop call for caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 2025-05-06 | -0.24    | -0.27        | 0.03        |
| 2025-02-24 | -0.18    | -0.15        | -0.03       |
| 2024-11-04 | -0.25    | -0.26608      | 0.01608     |
| 2024-08-06 | -0.63    | -0.59        | -0.04       |

Consistently negative EPS figures across all reported quarters raise significant concerns about the company's profitability and sustainability.  While the company has sometimes beaten expectations, the overall trend is negative. This strongly contradicts the positive CAGR and cumulative returns reported earlier, demanding more thorough investigation into the discrepancy.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $0.26B | 60.69%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.20B | 60.83%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.18B | 58.50%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.17B | 45.50%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.15B | 53.28%        |

Revenue is growing, but the profit margins, while high, fluctuate.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE          |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $0.33B    | -20.86%      |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B    | -23.10%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.05B    | -141.16%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.10B    | -562.04%     |
| 2024-03-31 | $-1.47B   | 4.39%        |

Extremely negative ROE figures in most quarters are alarming.  This strongly suggests significant financial distress and potential insolvency risks.  These figures are inconsistent with the high reported CAGR and cumulative returns and demand clarification.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

TEM's performance data presents a highly contradictory picture.  While displaying exceptionally high cumulative returns and a positive CAGR, the company shows consistent negative EPS, highly volatile price action, extremely negative ROE, and a highly overbought RSI. The large discrepancies between various financial metrics strongly suggest the need for additional due diligence and a deeper understanding of the underlying business before considering any investment. The high risk profile and conflicting data raise significant concerns regarding the sustainability of the observed returns.  The company's financial health needs to be thoroughly investigated to assess whether the current stock price accurately reflects its true value and prospects.
