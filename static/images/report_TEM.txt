**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE           |

| 2024-12-31  | $0.06B     | -23.10%       |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.05B     | -141.16%      |

| 2023-12-31  | $-1.38B    | 3.65%         |

Negative equity and extremely negative ROE in recent quarters are alarming. This suggests serious financial distress.  The high profitability margins do not offset this negative capital situation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM exhibits a strong recent performance relative to the S&P 500, but this masks serious underlying financial weaknesses.  High profit margins are overshadowed by negative equity and extremely negative ROE.  The recent price surge may be unsustainable given the company’s financial condition.  While short-term momentum might be present, the long-term outlook is clouded by the negative earnings and severe financial distress reflected in the capital and profitability figures.  Further investigation into the company's business model and prospects is strongly recommended before any investment decision.  The extremely high beta suggests significant risk even if the short-term outlook seems positive.  A long-term investment would require careful consideration of the company’s ability to overcome its current financial challenges.
