## TEM (Unknown Company) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

TEM shows a significantly higher cumulative return (56.75%) compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 15.74%.  This indicates a substantial outperformance. However, the provided data only covers a short period, and the high volatility (max 89.9%, min -37.6%) needs further investigation.  The current relative divergence of 61.6% suggests the stock is performing well relative to its historical volatility against the S&P 500, but it doesn't guarantee future performance.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Unknown Company (TEM) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 56.75% versus 15.74%.  The difference of 41 percentage points is substantial.  The alpha of 47% suggests significant outperformance relative to the market benchmark (S&P 500), while the beta of 10.7 indicates high volatility; the stock's price movements are more than 10 times as volatile as the S&P 500.  The high CAGR (61%) further supports strong historical growth, but this is balanced by a significant maximum drawdown (MDD) of 41%.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 61.0% | 41.0% | 47.0% | 10.7 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

TEM's recent price action shows a clear downward trend. The closing price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating bearish momentum. The significant drop from the previous close (-11.25%) points to a potential sell-off.

* **Closing Price:** 68.09
* **5-day MA:** 80.38
* **20-day MA:** 67.26
* **60-day MA:** 51.49


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (57.59):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to neutral territory.
* **PPO (-0.85):** Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-25.5%):** Shows a significant recent drop in relative strength against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (NaN):**  The absence of an expected return value prevents a precise prediction of future performance relative to the S&P 500.  Long-term (2+ years) investing requires a careful assessment of the company's fundamentals and risk tolerance.  The high volatility and recent price drop introduce significant uncertainty.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has reported negative EPS in recent quarters, although the actual EPS has been slightly better than expected in both instances. This warrants further investigation into the underlying causes of these losses.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-04 | -0.25  | -0.26608      |
| 2024-08-06 | -0.63  | -0.59         |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows a slight upward trend, suggesting some growth. However, the profitability (profit margin) fluctuates considerably.  The capital and profitability metrics are highly concerning.  Negative equity and extremely high negative ROE values indicate serious financial problems.  This warrants a deep dive into the company's balance sheet and cash flow statements to understand the root cause of these issues.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.18B | 58.50%       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM shows impressive past performance relative to the S&P 500, driven by high CAGR and alpha. However, the high volatility, negative EPS, extremely negative ROE, and substantial recent price drop raise significant concerns.  The negative equity is a serious red flag.  While the recent revenue growth is positive, the severe financial problems evidenced in the capital and profitability metrics suggest significant risk.  Further investigation into the company's financials and business model is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current situation strongly suggests a high-risk, high-reward scenario, and careful consideration of the underlying financial issues is paramount before considering any investment.
