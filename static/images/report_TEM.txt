## TEM (Unknown Company) Stock Report

This report analyzes TEM, an Unknown Company, comparing its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

TEM's cumulative return (5.13%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (-12.09%).  The relative divergence, at 30.6%, indicates TEM's performance is in the higher range compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (between a minimum of -22.4% and a maximum of 107.1%). However, it's crucial to remember that this relative divergence is not a measure of absolute outperformance.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows a positive CAGR of 5.0% over 2023-2025, but a high maximum drawdown (MDD) of 84.2%. The negative alpha (-0.0) suggests TEM's returns are not significantly exceeding the market's returns after adjusting for risk (beta of 6.7). This high beta indicates substantial volatility.  The market capitalization (Cap) is listed as 6.7B.  Further investigation is needed to understand the discrepancy between the positive CAGR and negative alpha.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

TEM's closing price is 42.70.  The last market price is 38.9, indicating a recent drop of -8.9% (-3.8).  The recent price movement shows a clear downward trend:

* **5-day moving average:** 45.71
* **20-day moving average:** 48.54
* **60-day moving average:** 54.63

The price is below all three moving averages, reinforcing the bearish trend. The significant single-day drop of -8.9% warrants further investigation into potential news or events that may have triggered this decline.  This sharp decline could be considered a "급하락" (sharp drop).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk) suggests significant volatility.
* **RSI:** 45.77, indicating the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -1.136, a negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.4%, showing a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return:**  `nan`  The expected return is not provided, preventing a direct comparison to the S&P 500's long-term expected return.  Without this data, it's impossible to assess potential long-term alpha.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals consistent negative EPS, though the magnitude of the misses has varied.  While expectations were mostly met or slightly exceeded, the negative EPS itself suggests underlying operational challenges.

Negative equity and extremely low ROE figures suggest serious financial distress and require immediate attention.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM's short-term performance relative to the S&P 500 is positive,  however this is driven by a high beta and a very high MDD.  The negative EPS, alarming financial statements (negative equity and extremely volatile ROE), and the recent sharp price drop paint a concerning picture of the company's financial health. While the revenue growth is positive, the negative equity and deeply negative ROE figures suggest significant underlying issues that need to be addressed immediately.  The high risk indicated by the MRI further emphasizes the caution required when considering an investment in TEM.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative EPS and negative equity is critical before any investment decision can be made.  The provided data strongly suggests a high-risk, high-volatility investment with significant downside potential.  Long-term investment should only be considered after a thorough investigation into the underlying reasons for the company's financial challenges.
