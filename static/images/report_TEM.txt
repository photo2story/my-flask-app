**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 historically. However, this performance comes with substantial volatility (high beta and MDD).  Recent price action, technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages), and the alarmingly negative equity and ROE figures paint a concerning picture. While revenue growth is positive, the consistently negative EPS and precarious financial situation warrant serious caution.  Further investigation into the underlying causes of the negative equity and the recent price drop is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high alpha suggests potential, but the high risk associated with TEM needs to be carefully weighed against the potential reward.  More detailed analysis of the companyâ€™s business model and future prospects is recommended before investment.
