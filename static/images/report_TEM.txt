The recent sharp price increase (Last-Market data) highlights the potential volatility of this stock.

|---------|------------|------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.05      | -141.16%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.10      | -562.04%   |

The negative equity and extremely low ROE raise significant concerns about the financial health and sustainability of the company.  This needs immediate attention.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM shows impressive returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, several red flags emerge: the extremely high beta, the negative equity and  extremely volatile ROE, and the overbought RSI.  While recent revenue growth is positive, the consistent losses, and negative equity raise substantial concerns about the company's long-term viability.  The high relative divergence, while suggestive of strong outperformance, may also indicate a deviation from a sustainable long-term trend.  Further due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions, focusing on understanding the underlying drivers of both the strong returns and the concerning financial metrics.  The high volatility makes it unsuitable for risk-averse investors.
