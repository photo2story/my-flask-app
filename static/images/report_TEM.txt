## TEM: Unknown Company Stock Report

This report analyzes TEM, an Unknown Company, comparing its performance to the S&P 500 (VOO).  The analysis uses provided financial data and technical indicators.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

TEM's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500.

| Metric                     | TEM          | VOO (S&P 500) | Difference |
|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Cumulative Return (%)     | 36.50         | 17.34           | 19.16       |


The provided data shows TEM's return is substantially higher than the S&P 500. The relative divergence (44.5%) indicates that TEM's performance is positioned in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this does not guarantee future outperformance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 41.0% | 41.0% | 0.1   | 9.0  |  

TEM exhibits a high beta (9.0), suggesting significantly higher volatility than the market. A positive alpha (0.1) indicates it has generated some excess return compared to the market, considering its high risk.  The market capitalization is not specified in the provided information.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

| Metric          | Value      |
|-----------------|------------|
| Closing Price   | $57.39     |
| 5-Day MA       | $53.65     |
| 20-Day MA      | $43.43     |
| 60-Day MA      | $48.11     |

The recent price of $57.39 is above all three moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend.  The relatively large gap between the short-term (5-day) and longer-term (20, 60-day) moving averages suggests a recent price surge. The change from the previous close (+0.3497) confirms a small upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (74.44):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally above 70).  Suggests potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (4.79):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (12.9,+):** Shows a recent increase in relative strength, reinforcing the short-term upward trend.

The price increase from the previous close is relatively small and doesn't indicate a dramatic surge.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS       | Expected EPS |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2024-11-04 | -$0.25    | -$0.266       |
| 2024-08-06 | -$0.63    | -$0.59        |

Both reported EPS values are negative. While the November 2024 EPS was slightly better than expected, the company is currently showing losses.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons for these losses.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.18B | 58.50% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.17B | 45.50% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.15B | 53.28% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.15B | 55.20% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.14B | 54.41% |

Revenue is showing a slight upward trend. Profit margins are generally high but fluctuated.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE          |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.05B    | -141.16%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.10B    | -562.04%     |
| 2024-03-31 | -$1.47B   | 4.39%        |
| 2023-12-31 | -$1.38B   | 3.65%        |
| 2023-09-30 | -$1.32B   | 4.03%        |

Negative equity in recent quarters is a significant concern.  The highly volatile ROE further highlights the financial instability of the company.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM has shown impressive returns relative to the S&P 500. However, several red flags exist:  high beta implying high risk, negative EPS, negative equity, and volatile ROE. The high profit margins are positive, but the negative equity raises serious concerns about the long-term viability of the company.  While the recent price movement is positive, the strong upward trend might be unsustainable given the underlying financial issues.  The expected return (nan) and the high risk profile of TEM require careful consideration before investment.  Further investigation into the reasons for negative equity and losses is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data is insufficient to confidently predict future performance.
