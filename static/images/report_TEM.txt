## TEM Stock Analysis Report: Unknown Company

**0. Executive Summary:**

TEM, an Unknown Company, shows a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While exhibiting high volatility and negative earnings, its strong revenue growth and relatively high profit margins warrant further investigation.  However, concerning negative equity and ROE figures require careful consideration.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **TEM Cumulative Return:** 19.97%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** -3.43%
* **Return Difference:** 23.4%  (This represents a 35.5% percentile rank relative to the historical range of -22.6% to 107.0% difference between TEM and VOO returns).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 20.0% | 75.0% | -0.1 | 9.3 |       |


TEM has a significantly high beta (9.3), indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The negative alpha (-0.1) suggests it hasn't outperformed the market after accounting for risk. The extremely high maximum drawdown (MDD) of 75% highlights substantial risk. The missing market capitalization data prevents a complete assessment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $52.90
* **Previous Close:** $53.50
* **Daily Change:** -$1.12 (-2.09%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $48.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $44.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $54.74

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend. The recent price drop may indicate a short-term correction after a period of strong growth.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 64.82 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 3.46 (Positive; bullish signal)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.2% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** NaN (Not provided)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI and MRI suggest moderate risk, the positive PPO and upward trend in relative divergence indicate potential for further gains.  The absence of an expected return prevents a quantitative assessment of long-term potential. The recent price drop of -1.12 reflects a minor correction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2025-02-24 | -0.18   | -0.15        |
| 2024-11-04 | -0.25   | -0.266       |
| 2024-08-06 | -0.63   | -0.59        |

TEM has consistently reported negative EPS, although recent results have been slightly better than expectations.  The persistent losses are a major concern.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.20B    | 60.83%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.18B    | 58.50%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.17B    | 45.50%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.15B    | 53.28%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.15B    | 55.20%        |

Revenue shows steady growth, and profit margins remain relatively high despite the negative EPS. This discrepancy needs further investigation into the company's accounting practices.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE          |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.06B     | -23.10%       |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.05B     | -141.16%      |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.10B     | -562.04%      |
| 2024-03-31  | $-1.47B    | 4.39%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $-1.38B    | 3.65%        |

The negative equity figures for most quarters are extremely concerning and raise serious questions about the company's financial health and solvency. The highly volatile ROE further underscores the risk involved.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM exhibits a high growth rate and strong profit margins in terms of revenue.  However, persistent negative earnings, significantly negative equity, and extremely high volatility (high beta and MDD) pose major risks. The recent price decline suggests a potential correction.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative equity and the discrepancy between revenue profitability and negative EPS is crucial before making any investment decisions.  More information is needed on the business model of the unknown company, and a thorough due diligence is strongly recommended.  The high risk profile may not be suitable for risk-averse investors.
