* **Cumulative Return (TEM):** 27.60%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** -0.64%
* **Return Difference:** 28.24% (TEM outperformed VOO by 28.24 percentage points)

**Company Overview:** *(Requires further information to provide a concise overview.)*


**Alpha, Beta Analysis (2023-2025):**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 28.0% | 75.0% | -0.1 | 9.9 |        |

* **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  28.0% indicates strong growth over the period.
* **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 75.0% signifies substantial risk; the investment experienced a significant drop at some point.  This is a serious concern despite the high CAGR.
* **Alpha:** -0.1 suggests underperformance relative to the market risk, adjusted for its beta.
* **Beta:** 9.9 indicates extremely high volatility; TEM is almost 10 times more volatile than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 57.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 53.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 46.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 54.10

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend, but the significant gap between the 20-day and 60-day MA indicates price volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk) – Suggests moderate risk.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 77.94 –  This is in the overbought territory (generally above 70), suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 3.24 – Positive value indicating upward momentum, but the magnitude needs to be considered in context with other indicators.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.7 – Shows a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** NaN –  This requires further analysis or modeling to provide an estimate of the expected return relative to the S&P 500, considering the high volatility and high RSI.  A long-term investment would be highly dependent on future performance and risk tolerance.

**Conclusion:**

TEM has shown impressive returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the exceptionally high beta, substantial MDD, and overbought RSI suggest significant risk. The high relative divergence from VOO warrants caution. Further investigation is needed to determine if the current price is justified and to assess the sustainability of its performance.  The high risk profile does not support a blanket recommendation for long-term investment without a comprehensive understanding of the underlying business.
