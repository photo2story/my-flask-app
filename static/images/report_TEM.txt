*   **Company Overview:** Tempus AI Inc. is a technology company that is advancing precision medicine through the practical application of artificial intelligence in healthcare.
*   **Return Rate Divergence:** TEM is significantly underperforming the S&P 500. The divergence of -17.4 means that the TEM's return is 17.4% lower than the S&P 500's return over the same period. The relative divergence of 19.7 indicates that this underperformance is near the bottom of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.

    *   **CAGR:** Projected CAGR of 11.0% (2024-2026) indicates decent growth potential.
    *   **MDD:** A Maximum Drawdown of 56.3% is very high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
    *   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha (-16.0%) shows that TEM has underperformed relative to its risk (Beta).
    *   **Beta:** The Beta of 2.8 suggests that TEM is much more volatile than the market (S&P 500).  It moves 2.8 times as much as the market.
    *   **Cap(B):**  A market cap of 12.4B places it in the large-cap category.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   The stock is trading at 69.54, which is above its previous close of 64.7 (increase of 7.48), indicating a recent positive movement.
*   The 5-day SMA (61.194) is below the 20-day SMA (67.7193), which is below the 60-day SMA (76.896). This suggests a possible downtrend in the short to medium term, although the latest market price is encouraging.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A Market Risk Indicator of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 27.486 indicates that TEM is currently oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" signal, with the 'Very Safe' classification and high MRI, suggests a strong buy recommendation based on the algorithm's risk assessment, with a small monthly investment recommended.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence (-1.1) indicates a short-term downward trend compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The `nan` value for Expected Return is problematic. It means the model couldn't calculate a reliable expected return, possibly due to data limitations or model instability. The comment about needing 2+ years of investment horizon is typical for these kinds of predictions.
