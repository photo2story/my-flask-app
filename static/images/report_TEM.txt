**Analysis:**

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **Company Overview:** Tempus AI Inc. is a company focused on using artificial intelligence to personalize healthcare by analyzing molecular and clinical data.
*   **Underperformance:** TEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The cumulative return of TEM is 11.92% compared to the S&P 500's 32.43%.
*   **Divergence:** The divergence of -15.0 indicates that TEM's performance lags behind the S&P 500. A relative divergence of 22.3 suggests it's near the lower end of its divergence range, historically.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:** The negative Alpha (-20.0%) suggests that the company's returns were lower than expected for the risk assumed. The low Beta (0.3) indicates that the stock is significantly less volatile than the overall market.
*   **CAGR & MDD:** The 12.0% CAGR is respectable, but the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 76.7% signifies significant volatility and risk.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Downward Trend:** The stock price is currently at 61.47. All the moving averages (5-day, 20-day, 60-day) are above the current price, indicating a recent downward trend.
*   **Short-Term Decline:** The 5-day SMA is closer to the current price than the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a more recent and rapid decline.
*   **Negative Change:** The 'change' of -1.96 from the previous close indicates a recent price decrease.

**3. Indicators:**

*   **High Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** A MRI of 0.9 suggests that based on the algorithm, the stock is recommended as a medium to high investment.
*   **Oversold RSI:** An RSI of 18.47 indicates the stock is heavily oversold, potentially signaling a possible (but not guaranteed) rebound.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO (-0.95) further supports a downward trend, indicating that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence (-9.7) confirms the short-term downward movement.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (14 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)" signal suggests an algorithmic recommendation to buy the stock, given the provided parameters, but the very low RSI conflicts with it.
*   **Expected Return:** The 'nan' value for Expected Return is unhelpful.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news headlines present a mixed picture.
    *   Some articles highlight the stock's positive performance earlier in the year ("Why Tempus AI Stock Is Up 87% In 2025") and discuss its progress ("How Tempus AI Is Advancing Toward Regulatory Pricing Catch-Up").
    *   Other articles note recent underperformance ("$TEM stock fell 3% this week") and a price pullback ("Tempus AI (TEM): Assessing Valuation After a Recent Share Price Pullback").
    *   The article comparing TEM to HIMS suggests considering alternative investments in the same sector.
*   **Analyst Coverage:** The presence of articles mentioning "Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Follow Now" and valuation assessments indicate that analysts are actively covering TEM.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Positive Outlook:** The analyst consensus of "Buy" with a mean rating of 2.14 suggests a generally positive outlook on the stock.
*   **Price Target:** The average target price of 88.92 indicates a significant potential upside from the current price (61.47).
*   **No Recent Rating Changes:** The absence of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the immediate shifts in sentiment.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Tempus AI Inc. (TEM) has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. Recent performance data indicates a downward trend, with the stock price below key moving averages and an oversold RSI. Analyst ratings remain generally positive with a considerable price target upside, but there have been no recent rating changes to consider. News headlines portray a mix of positive long-term prospects and recent challenges.

**In conclusion, TEM presents a complex picture:**

*   **Risks:** High MDD, recent negative price action, underperformance vs. the market, and volatile MRI suggests that high level of caution is required.
*   **Potential Upsides:** Positive analyst ratings, significant potential upside based on target prices, and potentially oversold conditions may warrant a careful observation of the stock for opportunities.
*   **Recommendation:** A cautious approach is recommended. Further research into the company's fundamentals, financial health, and the reasons behind the recent price decline is necessary before making any investment decisions. The high MDD suggests a need for a high-risk tolerance.
