The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend. The recent price drop of $7.99 (-18.26%) compared to the previous close suggests a sharp decline.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM has shown strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the past, with a high relative divergence. However, recent price action indicates a sharp decline, and the company's financial statements reveal significant concerns regarding its profitability and financial stability.  The negative EPS and highly volatile ROE raise serious questions about the long-term viability of the company. While the high profit margins are positive, the negative equity and volatile ROE are significant red flags.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price drop and the company's financial health is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high beta suggests a volatile stock unsuitable for risk-averse investors.  Despite the past outperformance,  the current indicators suggest caution is warranted.
