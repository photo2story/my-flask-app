**1. Performance Comparison:**

TEM significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return of 92.77% compared to VOO's 19.27%.  The substantial difference of 73.5% highlights TEM's exceptional performance, though this needs to be viewed in the context of the relative divergence which emphasizes the unusually strong recent performance.  The high alpha (79.0%) and extremely high beta (13.2) suggest significant market outperformance, potentially driven by high volatility and risk. The high CAGR (97%) further reinforces the strong performance, but the high MDD (41%) indicates substantial risk.

* **Closing Price:** $83.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $73.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $58.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $49.31

The recent price of $83.75 shows a sharp increase from the previous close ($73.88), a 13.4% jump.  All moving averages are significantly below the current price, suggesting a recent price surge.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 86.67 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.)
* **PPO:** 3.12 (Positive, indicating upward momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +32.8% (Significant short-term upward momentum.)

The high RSI indicates the stock is currently overbought, raising concerns about a potential near-term pullback. However, the positive PPO and strong relative divergence suggest continued upward momentum in the short term. The recent price surge of 13.4% clearly signifies a significant price increase that needs to be considered in any analysis.  The Expected Return is not provided (`nan`) and would require further modeling and analysis using historical data and future projections.

| 2024-06-30  | $0.17B      | 45.50%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.15B      | 53.28%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.15B      | 55.20%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE           |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.05B      | -141.16%      |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.10B      | -562.04%      |
| 2024-03-31  | -$1.47B     | 4.39%         |
| 2023-12-31  | -$1.38B     | 3.65%         |
| 2023-09-30  | -$1.32B     | 4.03%         |

Extremely negative ROE in Q2 and Q3 2024 is a major red flag, suggesting significant financial distress.  The positive ROE in Q1 2024 and Q4 2023 is insufficient to offset these negative figures.  This warrants a deep dive into the company's balance sheet and cash flow statements.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM exhibits exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by significant volatility and risk as evidenced by the high beta, MDD, and the alarming negative ROE figures in recent quarters.  The recent price surge is noteworthy, but the overbought RSI suggests a potential correction.  While revenue is growing, the persistent negative EPS and alarmingly negative ROE figures raise serious concerns about the company's long-term financial health and sustainability.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative ROE and the sustainability of the recent strong performance.  Given the financial distress signals, caution is advised before making any investment decisions.  Thorough due diligence, including analysis of the company's fundamentals and financial statements, is essential before considering an investment in TEM.
