**1) Return Rate Comparison (TEM vs. S&P 500 (VOO)):**

*   **Company Overview:** Tempus AI Inc. is a technology company focused on precision medicine through data analysis and artificial intelligence.
*   TEM has outperformed the S&P 500 over the covered period (33.72% vs. 30.50% cumulative return).

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**
    *   CAGR is a strong 34%, indicating significant growth potential, but is offset by a very high MDD (76.7%), indicating substantial risk.
    *   The alpha of 4.0% suggests TEM is generating returns above what's explained by market movements, while the beta of 0.3 indicates it's significantly less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500).

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium investment recommendation based on market risk.
*   An RSI of 56.90 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   A PPO of 1.40 suggests a potential upward trend, as the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" favoring 100% buy with a high MRI score shows a strong bullish signal.
*   The recent negative divergence change of -2.9 signals a short-term decline in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
*   The NaN for expected return makes it impossible to determine if it should be invested.
