The relative divergence of 39.9% indicates TEM's performance lies near the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

A positive alpha (0.1) indicates outperformance relative to the market after adjusting for risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

| 60-Day Moving Avg.  | $51.15      |

The recent closing price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downtrend. The 60-day moving average is close to the closing price, suggesting a potential support level. The recent price increase of 3.53% from the previous close might signal a temporary rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

| Metric                         | Value       | Interpretation                                   |
|---------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| RSI                             | 38.02       | Approaching oversold territory; potential bounce |
| PPO                             | -6.04       | Bearish signal                                  |

The RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, hinting at a potential price increase. However, the negative PPO and negative relative divergence suggest a bearish trend. The 3.53% price increase from the previous close needs to be viewed in the context of the overall downtrend.  The lack of an expected return value makes long-term prediction difficult.

Negative equity and extremely volatile ROE are significant red flags. This warrants a deeper dive into the company's balance sheet and capital structure.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM exhibits strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, reflected in high cumulative returns and a positive alpha. However, recent price action shows a weakening trend, and negative earnings, coupled with extremely negative ROE and negative equity, raise serious concerns about the company's financial health.  The high beta suggests significant market risk.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative equity and volatile ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  While the high profit margins are positive, the unsustainable negative equity makes the long-term outlook uncertain.  The short-term outlook appears bearish based on the technical indicators and recent price movement.  More information is needed to assess the long-term viability and expected return of TEM.
