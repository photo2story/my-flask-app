**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

| Metric                      | TEM          | VOO           | Difference | Relative Divergence |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Cumulative Return (%)      | 27.60        | -0.64         | 28.24       | 39.2%                 |


TEM significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period, showing a 28.24% higher cumulative return. The relative divergence indicates TEM's performance lies in the 39.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This does not, however, guarantee future outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 28.0% | 75.0% | -0.1  | 9.9  |       |

TEM exhibits a high Beta (9.9), suggesting high volatility and significant sensitivity to market movements.  A negative alpha (-0.1) indicates underperformance relative to the market after adjusting for risk.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) of 75% highlights considerable risk.  Missing capitalization data hinders a complete assessment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

| Metric             | Value      |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Closing Price       | 57.06      |
| 5-Day Moving Average | 53.73      |
| 20-Day Moving Average| 46.24      |
| 60-Day Moving Average| 54.10      |

The recent price of TEM is above its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  However, the 20-day moving average is significantly lower, indicating potential short-term correction risk.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

| Indicator                    | Value          | Analysis                               |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Market Risk Indicator (MRI)  | 0.3776        | Medium Risk                              |
| RSI                         | 77.94          | Overbought territory (above 70), suggesting potential for a price correction. |
| PPO                         | 3.24           | Positive value indicates upward momentum.  |
| 20-Day Relative Divergence | +3.7           | Short-term upward momentum              |
| Expected Return             | nan            | Not available.                            |


The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, potentially indicating a short-term price correction.  However, positive PPO and rising relative divergence signal continued short-term upward momentum. The absence of an expected return calculation prevents a definitive long-term outlook.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 2025-05-06 | -0.24   | -0.27        | +0.03       |
| 2025-02-24 | -0.18   | -0.15        | -0.03       |
| 2024-11-04 | -0.25   | -0.266       | +0.016      |
| 2024-08-06 | -0.63   | -0.59        | -0.04       |

TEM has consistently reported negative EPS, though the recent quarters show some improvement compared to expectations.  However, the overall trend remains negative, suggesting profitability challenges for the company.  Further analysis is needed to ascertain if this negative EPS is structural or cyclical.

**5. Financial Information:**

No key financial data (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) is available for TEM, significantly limiting a comprehensive financial analysis.  This lack of information makes it difficult to determine the company's financial health and sustainability.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

TEM has shown exceptionally strong performance compared to the S&P 500 in the short term. However, this is accompanied by high volatility (high beta and MDD), negative alpha suggesting market-adjusted underperformance, and a lack of profitability (negative EPS).  Furthermore, the absence of critical financial data and the overbought RSI signal caution.  The high relative divergence may be unsustainable.  Before considering investment, further due diligence is strongly recommended to understand the underlying business, its financial health, and the reasons behind the significant outperformance.  The high risk profile, coupled with limited information, warrants a cautious approach.
