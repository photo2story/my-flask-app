**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 21.0% | 75.0% | 6.0% | -0.0 | 10.3 |

*   **CAGR:** 21.0% (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) indicates strong average annual growth over the period.

*   **Cap(B):** 10.3B (Market Capitalization in Billions) suggests TEM is a large-cap company.

**Analysis:** TEM has outperformed the S&P 500, but the large drawdown (75%) suggests high volatility.  The low beta implies the stock's price movement is independent of overall market trends.  The positive Alpha means the stock has generated returns independent of market movements.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Previous Close:** \$58.41
*   **Price Change:** 2.04% increase
*   **5-day Moving Average:** \$58.9996
*   **20-day Moving Average:** \$65.2117
*   **60-day Moving Average:** \$59.6091

**Analysis:** The current price is above the 5-day moving average but below the 20-day moving average.  The 60-day moving average is nearly equal to the current price.  The recent price increase of 2.04% suggests a short-term upward trend. The price closed up over 2% in the last session.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return

*   **RSI:** 32.58 (Approaching Oversold Territory)

*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -4.0 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** NaN

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk.  The RSI is approaching oversold territory. The PPO is negative, implying a downtrend. The "Cash 69%" Hybrid Signal suggests a defensive strategy is warranted.  The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term downward trend. The "NaN" expected return is concerning and needs clarification.  The price increase of 2.04% in the last session can be considered a reaction to oversold conditions.

**Analysis:** Revenue is trending upward, and profit margins are generally high. The Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile and largely negative, indicating the company is struggling to generate profits from shareholder equity. The negative equity in the first quarter of 2024 is a serious concern and needs further investigation.

### 7. Summary & Conclusion

TEM (Unknown Company) presents a mixed picture. While the stock has outperformed the S&P 500, it exhibits high volatility, negative earnings, and concerning ROE figures. Recent news points to uncertainty and increased risk. The low MRI is a plus, but the Hybrid signal suggesting a defensive position, and decreasing relative divergence, are cause for concern. The lack of an expected return is also a red flag. Overall, given the current information, **a cautious approach is recommended**. Further research into the company's financials, business operations, and recent developments is crucial before making any investment decisions. The "NaN" value for expected return should be investigated to understand why this metric is unavailable.
