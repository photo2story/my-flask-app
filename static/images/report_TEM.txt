* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** -5.96%
* **Return Difference:** 11.52% (TEM outperformed VOO by 11.52 percentage points)

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 6.0% | 86.5% | 12.0% | -0.0 | 7.6 |

**Analysis:**  The CAGR of 6% suggests moderate growth over the period. However, the extremely high maximum drawdown (MDD) of 86.5% indicates significant risk. A negative beta (-0.0) suggests very low or no correlation with the market.  The extremely high alpha (12.0%) is unrealistic and requires further investigation for data integrity.  The market capitalization is listed as 7.6B.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $43.79
* **5-day Moving Average:** $42.49
* **20-day Moving Average:** $48.04
* **60-day Moving Average:** $54.82
* **Last Market Change:** +17.62% (Significant daily price increase, suggesting a potential 급반등 (sharp rebound))

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  However, the significant daily price increase warrants further investigation.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.35 (Neutral; slightly below 50 indicating bearish sentiment)
* **PPO:** -1.56 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -10.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** NaN (Not provided)

The high MRI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence change all point towards a bearish outlook. The significant daily price increase (+17.62%) is a significant outlier and needs further context to understand its implications.  The lack of an expected return makes it impossible to assess long-term potential relative to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-02-24 | -0.18  | -0.15         |
| 2024-11-04 | -0.25  | -0.26608      |
| 2024-08-06 | -0.63  | -0.59         |

**Analysis:**  The company has consistently reported negative EPS over the past three quarters. While the negative EPS are slightly better than expected, this is not a positive sign for future growth. Further investigation is needed into the reason for the consistent losses.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE           |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.06B      | -23.10%       |

| 2023-12-31  | $-1.38B     | 3.65%         |


**Analysis:**  Revenue is growing, and profit margins are consistently high.  However, the negative equity and extremely negative ROE figures are extremely concerning and suggest significant financial distress.  This stark contrast between high profitability and severely negative equity requires immediate investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM's performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the period considered, but this needs to be contextualized with the extremely high risk associated with the high maximum drawdown and the highly volatile and negative equity and ROE. High profit margins mask serious underlying financial issues. The recent price surge (+17.62%) needs further investigation to determine its sustainability.  The negative EPS and concerning financial statements raise serious questions about the long-term viability of the company.  More information is needed to provide a comprehensive and reliable assessment.  Before making any investment decision, further due diligence is crucial.
