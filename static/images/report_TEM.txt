**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $0.31B    | 61.99%        |

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE        |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $0.31B    | -13.84%    |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.33B    | -20.86%    |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been steadily increasing, along with profit margins. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating profits from its equity. The increase in revenue and profit margin is a positive sign, but the negative ROE suggests that the company needs to improve its profitability relative to its equity.

**7. Overall Analysis & Conclusion**

Tempus AI is experiencing significant growth in revenue and has outperformed the S&P 500 recently. The company's high CAGR highlights its growth potential, but the high MDD indicates significant risk. Although analysts have a generally favorable buy recommendation, the negative ROE and cautionary hybrid signal warrant careful consideration.

**Investment Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is advised. While the company demonstrates high growth potential and analyst ratings are generally positive, recent warnings about its valuations should be considered along with the short-term downtrend and the recent negative EPS.
