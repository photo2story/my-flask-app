    *   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
    *   RSI: 18.47
    *   PPO: -0.95
    *   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = -9.7 (-): 단기하락
    *   Expected Return (%): NaN

*   **Simple Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** Despite other bearish signals, the MRI is high, suggesting the model still sees the stock as favorable for investment. *However, given the other indicators, this should be viewed with caution and further investigation.*
    *   **RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 18.47 indicates that the stock is heavily oversold, potentially suggesting a possible, short-term rebound.
    *   **PPO:** The Price Oscillator (PPO) of -0.95 confirms the downtrend, showing that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" signal suggests a strong buy recommendation based on the algorithm, but it's labeled "Very Safe" *and should be questioned* considering the MRI. The suggestion to invest 5% of total investment monthly is a risk-averting strategy.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term decline compared to the S&P 500.
    *   **Expected Return:** The "NaN" for expected return suggests there's either not enough data or the model can't reliably predict long-term returns at this point.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   Stock fell 3% this week (Quiver Quantitative)
    *   Up 87% YTD (TIKR.com) - *Contradicts the overall underperformance. Likely refers to a specific period earlier in the year.*

    *   CEO Sells Shares (MarketBeat) - *Generally a negative signal.*
    *   Advancing Toward Regulatory Pricing Catch-Up (Zacks) - *Potentially positive long-term catalyst.*

*   **Simple Analysis:** The news is mixed. While there's a headline about significant year-to-date gains, the more recent news focuses on a decline this week, insider selling (CEO), and uncertainty. The news about regulatory pricing catch-up is a positive, but long-term, potential catalyst.

*   **Target Prices:** The average target price is $88.92, with a high of $105.00 and a low of $80.00. This implies a significant potential upside from the current price.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Tempus AI presents a mixed picture. On one hand:

*   **Positives:**
    *   Strong Buy analyst consensus with a significant upside target.
    *   High MRI
    *   The RSI signals an oversold condition, suggesting a potential bounce.
    *   Potential for regulatory pricing catch-up could drive long-term growth.
    *   Despite the negative alpha, the company did experience growth in CAGR from 2023 to 2025.
*   **Negatives:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   Recent downtrend confirmed by moving averages.
    *   Negative alpha.
    *   High MDD (high volatility).
    *   CEO share selling raises concerns.
    *   Uncertainty indicated by the "Buy, Hold, or Sell" headline.
    *   A PPO that suggests recent stock price underperformance
    *   A negative trend in divergence

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this data, *TEM is a high-risk, speculative investment*. While the analyst consensus and potential for regulatory progress are encouraging, the recent underperformance, downtrend, and insider selling raise significant concerns. Investors should proceed with extreme caution, conduct further due diligence, and understand the potential for significant losses. The MRI is likely an outlier in this case. It would be best to review the parameters which make up the MRI for a more accurate analysis.
