2025-02-21 - Analysis Report
## TEM Stock Analysis: Unknown Company

**0. Summary Statistics:**

TEM exhibits significantly higher cumulative returns (105.86%) than the S&P 500 (VOO, 19.27%) over the analyzed period.  However, this outperformance needs careful consideration given the high volatility indicated by the provided data.  Technical indicators suggest an overbought condition, and recent earnings show continued losses.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

Unknown Company (TEM) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). The cumulative return difference is 86.6 percentage points, placing it at the 97.4th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500.  This substantial divergence warrants further investigation into the underlying drivers of this outperformance. (Note:  A high relative divergence doesn't guarantee future success; it only reflects past performance relative to the S&P 500.)


**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 110.0% | 41.0% | 92.0% | 14.1 |


The exceptionally high alpha (92.0%) suggests significant outperformance relative to the market, but the extremely high beta (14.1) indicates extreme volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  A beta this high is unusual and suggests significant risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 89.44
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 77.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 61.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 49.92

The price is significantly above all three moving averages, reinforcing the notion of a recent sharp increase.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 88.08  (Overbought territory; suggests potential for price correction)
* **PPO:** 3.56 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but high RSI indicates potential exhaustion)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +34.3 (Strong short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** nan (No information provided)

The high RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought, increasing the risk of a price pullback. While the positive PPO and strong relative divergence point to upward momentum, the high RSI acts as a cautionary signal.  The lack of an expected return calculation prevents a conclusive long-term outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-04 | -0.25   | -0.26608       |
| 2024-08-06 | -0.63   | -0.59         |

Both reported EPS figures are negative, indicating ongoing losses. While the November 2024 EPS was slightly better than expected, the overall trend shows continued losses, which is a significant concern.


**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available.  This severely limits the ability to perform a thorough fundamental analysis and understand the drivers of TEM's performance.  Without this key information, it's impossible to assess the company's financial health and sustainability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM has shown exceptionally high returns relative to the S&P 500, but this performance comes with considerable risk. The high beta, overbought technical indicators (RSI), and lack of positive financial information (no revenue/profit data) raise significant concerns about sustainability. The negative earnings figures further add to the cautionary outlook.  While the short-term momentum is strong,  the long-term outlook remains uncertain due to the absence of crucial financial data and the extremely high risk profile indicated by the high beta and negative earnings.  Further investigation is crucial before considering any investment in TEM.  The extreme divergence from the S&P 500 warrants careful consideration of the company's business model and future prospects before any investment decision.
