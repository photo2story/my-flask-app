## TEM: Unknown Company Stock Analysis

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

TEM shows a cumulative return of 4.43%, significantly outperforming VOO's -9.21% cumulative return.  The relative divergence of 27.9% indicates TEM's performance is considerably higher than VOO's relative to its historical range (107% to -22.6%).

The negative alpha (-0.1) suggests TEM underperformed the market, while the high beta (7.0) implies significantly higher volatility than the market.  The market capitalization (Cap) is not specified in the provided data.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM's short-term performance has outpaced the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by high volatility and a significant maximum drawdown. Negative alpha and a high beta suggest substantial risk.  The negative EPS and concerning ROE figures raise serious concerns about the company's financial health and long-term sustainability.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative ROE is crucial before considering any investment.  While the recent price increase is positive, the overall picture suggests caution is warranted.  More detailed financial statements and industry analysis are needed for a comprehensive assessment.  The current data strongly suggests a high-risk, high-reward situation with significant uncertainty.
