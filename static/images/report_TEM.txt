Okay, here's the requested report and analysis based on the data provided.

**1. Return Rate Analysis:**

*   **Ticker:** TEM (Tempus AI Inc)
*   **Company Overview:** Tempus AI Inc. is a company likely involved in applying artificial intelligence to healthcare, potentially in areas like personalized medicine or diagnostics.
*   **TEM Cumulative Return:** 10.82%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 28.20%
*   **Divergence:** -23.1 (Relative Divergence: 14.7)

**Analysis:**

*   TEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a cumulative return lagging by -17.38%.
*   The negative divergence of -23.1 indicates TEM's performance is considerably below that of the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 14.7 suggests it's near the lower end of its historical divergence range compared to VOO.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2024-2026  | 11.0% | 56.3% | -16.0% | 2.8 | 11.1 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The projected CAGR of 11.0% is a reasonably positive growth expectation, but it needs to be considered in light of other factors.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The very high MDD of 56.3% indicates significant potential risk and volatility. Investors could see a substantial loss from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** A negative Alpha of -16.0% suggests TEM has underperformed relative to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500 or a similar index) on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 2.8 means the stock is significantly more volatile than the market (S&P 500), with Beta = 1. This amplifies both gains and losses relative to the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** A Market Cap of 11.1 Billion USD indicates TEM is a Mid-Cap company.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 62.36
*   **Previous Close:** 59.05
*   **Change:** 5.61 (positive, indicating a recent increase)
*   **5-day SMA:** 61.19
*   **20-day SMA:** 67.72
*   **60-day SMA:** 76.90

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price closed higher than the previous close, indicating an upward movement.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a recent downward trend that *may* be reversing.  The recent price increase has pushed the close above the 5-day SMA, which could be a short-term bullish signal.
*   The 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, reinforcing the medium-term downtrend.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.49 (Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.72
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (14 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 5.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -7.4 (Negative Short-Term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** NaN (Not Available)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, but it's crucial to consider it in conjunction with other indicators.
*   The RSI is below 30, indicating the stock is oversold and *may* be due for a rebound.
*   The negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming a downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, suggesting a bullish outlook based on its model. The "Very Safe" designation and MRI 0.9 score from this model, however, seems contradictory given the other negative metrics.
*   The recent negative change in relative divergence confirms a short-term decline relative to the comparison stock.
*   The "Expected Return" being NaN is concerning, implying a lack of data or confidence in long-term projections. The current price is rebounding (5.61 increase vs. 59.05), which may influence short-term movements.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment Dominates:**  The news headlines are largely negative or cautious.
    *   Multiple articles mention lowered price targets from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BofA due to valuation concerns.
    *   One article states the stock fell 8% in a week.
    *   Several articles discuss whether the stock is a "Buy, Hold, or Sell" during a "pivotal transition," indicating uncertainty.
*   **Potential Positive Long-Term Theme:**
    *   One article mentions MedTech stocks poised to gain from the AI boom in 2026, which *could* be a positive long-term factor for Tempus AI.
*   **Yahoo Finance and MarketBeat are Primary Sources:** Most articles originate from Yahoo Finance and MarketBeat, which are reliable but require careful reading to discern opinion from fact.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus Rating:** Buy (Mean: 2.14 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 12
*   **Target Price:** Average: 88.92, High: 105.00, Low: 80.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not specified (Indicated as → ())

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating on the stock.
*   The average target price of 88.92 suggests a potential upside from the current price of 62.36. However, note the lowered price targets in the news.
*   The unspecified rating changes make it difficult to assess the current trend in analyst sentiment.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Overall Cautious Outlook:** The information paints a largely cautious picture for Tempus AI (TEM). While analysts have a "Buy" consensus and a potential upside based on target prices, several concerning factors exist.
*   **Underperformance and High Volatility:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibits high volatility (high MDD and Beta), and has a negative Alpha.
*   **Negative News Sentiment:** Recent news is dominated by lowered price targets and concerns about valuation, indicating a lack of confidence from some major financial institutions.
*   **Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals:** The oversold RSI and recent price increase *could* indicate a potential short-term rebound. However, the negative PPO and SMA trends suggest a longer-term downtrend.
*   **AI as a Potential Catalyst:** The potential for long-term growth in the MedTech sector due to AI advancements is a possible positive catalyst, but it's speculative.
*   **Hybrid Signal Contradiction:** The "Very Safe" recommendation by the Hybrid Signal, given the other negative indicators, should be viewed skeptically and investigated further.
*   **Actionable Conclusion:** TEM presents a risky investment opportunity. While the analyst consensus suggests "Buy" and the oversold RSI hints at a potential rebound, the significant underperformance, negative news, and high volatility warrant extreme caution. A potential investor should conduct thorough due diligence and understand the risks before investing. The NaN for "Expected Return" is a significant red flag.
