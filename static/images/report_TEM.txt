The negative PPO confirms the downward momentum.  The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a cautious stance, recommending a high cash position and a slight reduction in holdings, likely driven by the recent negative price action. The NaN expected return means that we can't use the S&P 500 as a base line to judge where the stock might go.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜         | EPS   | 예상 EPS |
|--------------|-------|----------|

| 2024-08-06   | -0.63 | -0.59    |

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $0.26B  | 60.69%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.20B  | 60.83%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.18B  | 58.50%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.17B  | 45.50%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.15B  | 53.28%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE        |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $0.33B   | -20.86%    |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B   | -23.10%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.05B   | -141.16%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.10B   | -562.04%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $-1.47B  | 4.39%      |

**Analysis:** Revenue is generally increasing. Profit margins are very high, which is positive. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is significantly negative in most quarters.  The negative equity in 2024-03-31 is also concerning. This suggests that while the company is generating revenue and maintaining high margins, it's not effectively translating that into profitability for shareholders, and it has had periods of significant financial distress.

**7. 종합 Summary**

TEM (Unknown Company) has outperformed the S&P 500 recently, but faces several challenges:

*   **Volatility:** The stock exhibits significant historical volatility.
*   **Recent Downturn:** The recent price drop and negative momentum indicators suggest a short-term downward trend.
*   **Unprofitability:** The company consistently reports negative EPS and has had periods of very negative ROE and even negative equity.
*   **News Uncertainty:** Recent news headlines indicate significant activity and potential disruption, but the specific details are unknown.

**Overall Assessment:**

TEM appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment. While the company has shown revenue growth and high profit margins, the persistent unprofitability, high volatility, and recent negative price action raise concerns. The recent news events could be a catalyst for positive or negative change, but without more information, it's difficult to assess their impact. The hybrid signal recommends caution at this time. Investors should closely monitor the company's earnings reports, financial statements, and news announcements before making any investment decisions.
