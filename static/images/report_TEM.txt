    *   Divergence (TEM - VOO): -23.10%
    *   Relative Divergence: 14.7 (Indicates it's near the low end of historical divergence.)

    *   Tempus AI Inc is a technology company that focuses on precision medicine through data analysis.
    *   TEM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The divergence of -23.1% indicates a substantial gap in returns. The relative divergence of 14.7 suggests that this underperformance is relatively close to its worst historical levels compared to VOO.
    *   This underperformance may suggest that the company carries more risk or is in a phase where it has not yet achieved its growth potential relative to the broader market.

    *   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, but this should be considered along with other indicators.
    *   The RSI of 27.49 indicates the stock is oversold, which *could* mean it is due for a rebound. However, it can also stay oversold for extended periods during a strong downtrend.
    *   The PPO of -0.72 indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the overall downward trend.
    *   Recent relative divergence change of -7.4 indicates short-term decline compared to the comparison index.
    *   The "Hybrid Signal" is aggressively bullish, recommending to buy 100% of available cash and invest 5% monthly, which may not be aligned to the other factors.
    *   The "Expected Return" is NaN, suggesting the model cannot predict a return at this time.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Tempus AI Inc. (TEM) presents a mixed picture. While the company operates in a promising sector (AI-driven precision medicine), the stock has significantly underperformed the broader market.  The projected CAGR is appealing, but the very high MDD and negative Alpha raise serious concerns about risk and value generation.

The recent stock price decline, combined with lowered analyst price targets (BofA, JPMorgan), suggests increasing market skepticism. While the RSI indicates the stock may be oversold, this doesn't guarantee a rebound.

The analyst consensus remains a "Buy," which contrasts with the negative price movement and other indicators. It's possible analysts are taking a longer-term view, but potential investors should carefully consider the risks before investing.

**In Summary:**

*   **Risky Investment:** TEM appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The indicators and news offer conflicting signals.
*   **Due Diligence Required:** Further investigation is warranted before making any investment decisions. Pay close attention to future news and analyst reports. Consider the recent price target reductions and the company's ability to achieve its projected growth in light of the challenges it faces. Understand the reasons for the high beta and negative alpha.
