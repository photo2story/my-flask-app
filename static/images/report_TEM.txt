## TEM: Unknown Company Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

TEM shows a significantly higher cumulative return (36.5%) than the S&P 500 (VOO) at 17.3%.  The relative divergence suggests TEM's performance is considerably above the S&P 500, currently sitting at the 44.5th percentile of its historical range.  However, a high relative divergence doesn't guarantee future outperformance.  Further analysis is crucial.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Unknown Company (TEM) is a [insert brief company description here â€“ you did not provide one].

* **Cumulative Return Difference:** TEM outperformed VOO by 19.2 percentage points at the last data point. (36.50% - 17.34% = 19.16%). The maximum historical outperformance is 89.9% and minimum is -37.6%.  Currently TEM's performance is 44.5% percentile of this range.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows a high CAGR (41.0%) and a relatively high beta (9.0), indicating significant market sensitivity.  The positive alpha (0.1) suggests some degree of outperformance beyond market movements, but this is relatively small given the high beta and should be interpreted cautiously.  The high MDD (41.0%) reflects considerable risk. A market capitalization of 9 Billion is indicated.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $57.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $53.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $43.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $48.11

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small daily change ($0.35) doesn't indicate a sharp upward or downward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (74.44):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (4.78):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (12.9, +):** Indicates a recent increase in relative strength.

The slight price increase, while not dramatic, confirms a short-term upward trend consistent with the positive Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence.  The `Expected Return` is listed as `nan`, so no projection is available.  Long-term investment (2+ years) might offer potential S&P 500 outperformance, given the historical data, but risk remains significant considering the high beta and MDD.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS       | Expected EPS |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2024-11-04 | -$0.25    | -$0.26608    |
| 2024-08-06 | -$0.63    | -$0.59       |

Both quarters show negative EPS, though the November 2024 result was slightly better than expected.  Consistent negative earnings are a major concern and warrant further investigation into the underlying causes.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.18B      | 58.50%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.17B      | 45.50%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.15B      | 53.28%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.15B      | 55.20%        |
| 2023-09-30  | $0.14B      | 54.41%        |

Revenue is gradually increasing, and profit margins are generally high.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE          |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.05B      | -141.16%     |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.10B      | -562.04%     |
| 2024-03-31  | -$1.47B     | 4.39%        |
| 2023-12-31  | -$1.38B     | 3.65%        |
| 2023-09-30  | -$1.32B     | 4.03%        |

Negative equity and extremely negative ROE in the last two quarters are deeply troubling, indicating serious financial issues that need urgent attention.  This starkly contrasts with the positive revenue and profit margin figures, suggesting a possible accounting issue or unsustainable business model.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM's high cumulative return compared to the S&P 500 is striking, but this must be viewed in light of significant risk factors. The high beta, substantial maximum drawdown, negative earnings, and alarmingly negative equity and ROE figures paint a concerning picture. While the high profit margins and increasing revenue are positive, they are overshadowed by the severe financial instability revealed in the capital and profitability data.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative equity and ROE, as well as the discrepancy between profitability and capital figures is absolutely essential before considering any investment.  The current high relative divergence and positive momentum may be unsustainable given the underlying financial weakness.  Caution is strongly advised.
