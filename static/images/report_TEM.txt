**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $62.56
*   **Previous Close:** $59.25
*   **Change:** $3.31 (5.59% increase - significant jump)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** $61.22
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $59.54
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $51.48

**Analysis:** The stock is trading above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. The significant price increase of 5.59% relative to the previous close, indicates a surge in buying pressure and may be driven by recent news or events.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 58.98 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.85 (Bearish signal, suggesting the price is below its moving average)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_68%_Sell 1.1% of holdings (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.37)
*   **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -7.1 (Negative, indicating a recent short-term decline relative to VOO)
*   **Expected Return (%):** NaN (Insufficient data to project long-term outperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a low-risk market environment.  The PPO indicates potential weakness despite the recent price jump. The recommendation to hold a high cash position (68%) and sell a small portion of holdings reflects caution, likely driven by the recent price volatility and negative divergence change. The NaN expected return indicates there's no reliable basis to predict future outperformance versus the S&P 500. The significant increase in price (5.59%) needs to be considered in light of these indicators, possibly representing a short-term reaction to specific news rather than a fundamental shift.
