## TEM (Unknown Company) Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

TEM's current price is $42.12, showing a recent 4.54% increase from the previous close.  The stock's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  However, several key indicators suggest caution, including negative EPS, volatile ROE, and low RSI.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **Company Overview:** Unknown Company (TEM) is a company whose specific business is not defined in the provided data.

* **TEM Cumulative Return:** 4.896
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** -6.383
* **Return Difference:** 11.3% (TEM outperforms VOO by 11.3%)
* **Relative Outperformance:** 26.0% (This indicates TEM's performance is in the 26th percentile of its historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, based on a range of -22.4% to 107.1%)

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 5.0% | 84.4% | -0.0 | 7.3 |  |


The high beta (7.3) suggests TEM is significantly more volatile than the market.  A negative alpha (-0.0) indicates that after adjusting for market risk, TEM has not outperformed the market during this period.  Note: The table lacks a market capitalization value.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $42.12
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $41.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $47.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $55.08

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent 4.54% increase could be a temporary bounce.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 28.93 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.31 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.3% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return:** NaN (Not provided)

The low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum.  The high MRI and recent negative relative divergence reinforce this bearish outlook.  The significant price jump ('change': 4.54) may indicate a temporary upward correction within a larger downtrend.  A long-term (2+ years) investment requires careful consideration given the current risk indicators.  The lack of an expected return value prevents a quantitative assessment of long-term S&P 500 outperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-02-24 | -0.18    | -0.15         |
| 2024-11-04 | -0.25    | -0.26608      |
| 2024-08-06 | -0.63    | -0.59         |

TEM has consistently reported negative EPS over the past three quarters, although the recent quarters show a slight improvement in actual EPS versus expected EPS.  However, this improvement alone is insufficient to suggest a significant turn-around.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.20B   | 60.83%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.18B   | 58.50%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.17B   | 45.50%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.15B   | 53.28%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.15B   | 55.20%        |

Revenue shows a steady, if modest, increase. Profit margins are generally healthy, although they fluctuated during the year.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity    | ROE          |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.06B    | -23.10%       |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.05B    | -141.16%      |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.10B    | -562.04%      |
| 2024-03-31  | -$1.47B   | 4.39%         |
| 2023-12-31  | -$1.38B   | 3.65%         |

The ROE is extremely volatile and largely negative, indicating significant issues with profitability relative to equity.  The large negative equity values in Q1 and Q2 2024 are highly concerning and require further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM's strong recent relative performance against the S&P 500 is striking, but it's crucial to view this within the context of the company's overall financial health and technical indicators.  The consistently negative EPS, highly volatile and largely negative ROE, low RSI, negative PPO, and high market risk indicator paint a concerning picture. While the recent price increase is noteworthy,  the underlying financial performance and technical signals suggest caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative equity and volatile ROE is crucial before considering any investment.  The substantial difference between the high relative outperformance and negative alpha and beta suggests potential short-term market anomalies affecting the relative comparison.  A comprehensive analysis incorporating additional financial statements and a deeper understanding of the company's underlying business is recommended before making any investment decisions.
