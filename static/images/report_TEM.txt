**Conclusion:**

Investing in TEM is currently a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The negative news and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 are concerning. However, the strong analyst consensus and potential for growth in the AI-driven MedTech sector could lead to significant returns in the long term. The MRI indicating medium investment risk could be misleading, given the recent news and underperformance. A cautious approach is advised, with thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. Furthermore, the "NaN" expected return makes it difficult to evaluate the company's long-term value.
