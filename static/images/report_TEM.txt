## TEM: Unknown Company Stock Analysis

This report analyzes TEM, an Unknown Company, based on provided financial data.  Note that without knowing the company's business specifics, the analysis is limited to the quantitative data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

TEM's cumulative return (27.60%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's return (-0.64%) over the period considered.  The difference is 28.2 percentage points. This places TEM at the 39.2nd percentile of its historical relative divergence against the S&P 500 (based on a historical range of -22.6% to 107%).  While this suggests strong relative performance, the context of the historical range is crucial; a high percentile does not guarantee future outperformance.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 28.0% | 75.0% | -0.1 | 9.9 |  |

The CAGR of 28.0% is impressive, but the high maximum drawdown (MDD) of 75.0% signals significant volatility and risk. A negative alpha (-0.1) indicates underperformance relative to the market, after adjusting for risk (beta). The exceptionally high beta (9.9) suggests extreme sensitivity to market movements. The missing market capitalization (Cap) makes comprehensive valuation difficult.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $57.06
* **5-day Moving Average:** $53.73
* **20-day Moving Average:** $46.24
* **60-day Moving Average:** $54.10

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. The significant jump in price from the previous close ($51.85 to $57.06, a 10.05% increase) indicates a recent sharp price surge.  This warrants further investigation into the underlying reasons for this sudden increase.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 77.94 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a correction)
* **PPO:** 3.24 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:**  nan.  The lack of an expected return calculation prevents a quantitative assessment of future potential.  However, given the historical outperformance and high beta, any future return projections should explicitly account for the extreme volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-02-24 | -0.18   | -0.15         |
| 2024-11-04 | -0.25   | -0.26608      |
| 2024-08-06 | -0.63   | -0.59         |

TEM has consistently reported negative EPS, though the recent quarters show a narrowing gap between actual and expected EPS. This does not indicate profitability and requires a deeper look into the underlying business operations to understand the causes of these losses.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.20B      | 60.83%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.18B      | 58.50%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.17B      | 45.50%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.15B      | 53.28%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.15B      | 55.20%        |

Revenue is steadily increasing. Profit margins are generally high, but the recent decrease in the June 2024 quarter needs further investigation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE          |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.06B      | -23.10%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.05B      | -141.16%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.10B      | -562.04%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $-1.47B     | 4.39%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $-1.38B     | 3.65%         |

Negative equity in several quarters raises significant concerns about the company's financial health and solvency. The extremely volatile and largely negative ROE further emphasizes this.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

TEM exhibits significant short-term price appreciation and high relative performance against the S&P 500. However, this positive performance is overshadowed by considerable risks.  The company consistently reports negative EPS, highly volatile ROE and significant negative equity.  The high beta indicates extreme market sensitivity, and the high MDD highlights substantial volatility.  Further investigation into the underlying business model, the reason for the recent price surge and the financial health of the company is crucial before any investment decisions are made.  The current data suggests significant risk and the need for cautious interpretation of the positive relative performance against the S&P 500.  The lack of a clear business overview prevents a comprehensive evaluation.
