TEM shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period.  However, high volatility and negative recent earnings raise concerns.  Further investigation into the underlying business is crucial for a complete assessment.

* **TEM Cumulative Return:** 21.23%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** -4.07%
* **Return Difference:** 25.3%  (This signifies TEM outperformed VOO by 25.3 percentage points. The relative divergence of 37% indicates that this outperformance is above average relative to historical performance fluctuations.)
* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  TEM exhibits a high beta (9.3), indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. The negative alpha (-0.1) suggests underperformance relative to the market, adjusted for risk. The high CAGR (21%) needs to be considered in the context of the significant maximum drawdown (MDD) of 75%.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $45.54
* **20-day Moving Average:** $44.73
* **60-day Moving Average:** $54.70

The recent price of $53.5 shows a significant jump from the previous close ($49.55), representing a 7.97% increase. This is a *sharp upward movement* and is above both the 5 and 20 day moving averages, but below the 60 day moving average. This suggests a recent strong positive momentum, but caution is needed given that the price may be above its longer term average.

The substantial price increase from the previous close warrants attention. While the indicators suggest positive momentum, the high beta and negative earnings data raise concerns about sustainability. A fundamental analysis is necessary to interpret these indicators accurately.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 2025-02-24 | -$0.18   | -$0.15      | -$0.03     |
| 2024-11-04 | -$0.25   | -$0.266     | +$0.016    |
| 2024-08-06 | -$0.63   | -$0.59      | -$0.04     |

All recent earnings show losses. While there was a small positive surprise in Q4 2024, the trend shows consistently negative EPS.  This raises serious questions about the company's profitability and the sustainability of its recent price surge.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is growing steadily. However, profit margins have fluctuated and decreased recently, indicating a potential decrease in profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** The equity figures and ROE show significant and highly volatile negative values.  This is a major red flag suggesting severe financial distress.  The sharp swings indicate significant instability in the company's financial position.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM shows a high cumulative return compared to the S&P 500. However, this performance is accompanied by extremely high volatility (high beta, significant MDD) and consistently negative earnings.  The recent price surge is concerning, particularly given the negative financial indicators (low equity, massively negative ROE). While short-term momentum might be positive, the financial health of the company is extremely questionable.  A thorough fundamental analysis, including examining the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future prospects, is absolutely essential before considering any investment.  The significant risk associated with TEM is clear based on the data provided.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution.
