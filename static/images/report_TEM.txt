Investors should weigh the potential upside based on analyst target prices and the company's long-term growth prospects against the recent underperformance, high volatility, and potential overvaluation concerns raised in some news articles. The lack of a concrete expected return further emphasizes the need for careful consideration and potentially a shorter-term investment horizon. Furthermore, the company's financials must be examined to determine whether the high expectations (and high volatility) are warranted.
