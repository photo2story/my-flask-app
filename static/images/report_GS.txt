**0. Key Figures:**

* **GS vs. VOO Return Difference:** 81.8%

**1. Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The provided data shows GS significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return more than 80% higher.  The relative divergence metric indicates this outperformance is at a historically high level within the provided dataset.  However, the CAGR and Alpha values in the provided table show considerable volatility and inconsistency in outperformance across different periods.  While some periods show substantial alpha (outperformance compared to the market, represented by beta), others show negative alpha indicating underperformance.  This suggests that while GS has the potential for significant returns, it also carries higher risk than simply investing in the S&P 500.  The high beta values in several periods reflect GS's sensitivity to market fluctuations.


**Table Analysis:**

The table reveals fluctuating performance. While periods of exceptionally high CAGR (e.g., 90%, 125%) exist, other periods experienced negative or near-zero growth. The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is also notable, indicating periods of significant losses. The Alpha values demonstrate inconsistent outperformance relative to the market, ranging from strongly negative to strongly positive. The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) suggests growth over time.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** 0.0 (-) (Indicates a recent slight weakening of relative strength.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.6% (This represents a modest expected outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.  However, this is a low value and the risk associated with GS should be considered).
* **Price Change:** The small negative price change (-$0.15) from the previous close does not indicate any significant sudden changes (no rapid upswing or downswing).


**Conclusion:**

Goldman Sachs exhibits a history of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this is not consistent across all time periods.  High risk is involved due to its higher volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations. The currently high RSI suggests potential short-term price correction. The positive PPO indicates upward momentum.  While a long-term investment might offer modest outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (0.6%), investors should carefully consider the substantial risk inherent in GS stock before making any investment decisions.  Further research and analysis beyond the provided data are recommended.
