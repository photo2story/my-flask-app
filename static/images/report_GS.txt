## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Investment Report

This report analyzes Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

GS's cumulative return (171.87%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (120.91%).  The difference is 50.96%, placing it at the 90th percentile of the historical divergence range (max: 61.6%, min: -44.9%). This suggests GS has historically outperformed the S&P 500 by a substantial margin in the context of its past performance.

The provided CAGR data shows varying performance across different periods. While some periods show strong outperformance (e.g., 2019-2021, 2022-2024), others show underperformance or even negative returns. Alpha consistently remains around 0.1, indicating a slight outperformance relative to the market's beta, but this is not significant. Beta fluctuates considerably, showing high sensitivity to market movements in some periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $585.48 (Last Market: $585.31)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $589.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $594.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $545.87

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The relatively large gap between the short-term and long-term moving averages might indicate a recent pullback after a period of growth.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 34.93 - Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce back.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.77 - Shows a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -5.0% - Shows a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return:** 7.7% (over S&P 500) over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment.

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the negative 20-day relative divergence, signals a bearish momentum. However, the relatively high expected return suggests that the current low price might represent a buying opportunity for long-term investors. The closing price of 585.31 is not significantly different from the last market price, so no major sudden price movement is observed.


**4. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided, preventing a detailed financial analysis.  This is a critical gap in the provided data and limits the ability to assess the company's financial health and sustainability.


**5. News and Recent Issues:**

No news regarding recent earnings announcements or current market outlook and analyst opinions was provided.  Information on these key aspects would significantly improve the overall analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs shows a history of outperforming the S&P 500, but the performance has been inconsistent across different periods.  Recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, but technical indicators (RSI) point towards oversold conditions. The lack of financial data and recent news significantly limits a comprehensive assessment.  The projected long-term outperformance warrants further investigation, contingent on the acquisition of missing financial data and news. The absence of recent earnings news and analyst opinions is a major limitation.  Further investigation into these aspects is critical for a more informed investment decision.  The current situation presents a mixed outlook. While the historical outperformance and expected return are positive factors, the negative short-term indicators and absence of financial data are significant concerns.  A more detailed analysis requires further information.
