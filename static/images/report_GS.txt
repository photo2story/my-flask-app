## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Stock Review

This report analyzes Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Goldman Sachs' cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference is 50.5 percentage points at the last recorded date.  This places GS at the 89.6th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, suggesting a strong outperformance.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $586.33
* **Last Market Price:** $577.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $588.20
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $594.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $547.38

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The gap between the current price and the 5- and 20-day averages is relatively small, indicating the price might be consolidating.  The significant distance from the 60-day moving average, however, hints at a more substantial price correction from recent highs.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price ($586.33 vs $577.36) is not significant enough to suggest a sudden dramatic event.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 35.75 – This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term buying opportunity.  However, this should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.77 – A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -4.0 – This indicates a recent downward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.

* **Expected Return:** 7.8% –  This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment.  This figure should be interpreted cautiously as it's a projection, not a guarantee.


**4. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available to provide a comprehensive financial analysis.  This significantly limits the depth of our analysis.

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News (within the last 2 days):**  This information is missing from the provided data.  Access to recent earnings releases is critical for a complete analysis.

* **Recent Market Outlook:**  This information is missing and needs to be obtained from external sources.

* **Analyst Opinions and Performance Highlights:**  This information is missing and needs to be obtained from external sources.


**6. CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance with varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, and Beta across different periods.  While some periods show strong outperformance (high CAGR and positive Alpha), others exhibit underperformance (low or negative CAGR and negative Alpha). The Beta consistently remains around 0.1 indicating low correlation with overall market movement, but this needs further contextualization with other financial metrics.  The significant variation in market capitalization (Cap(B)) across the years warrants a careful assessment of the company's growth strategy and overall financial health.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs shows a history of outperforming the S&P 500, particularly in recent years.  However, several factors need further investigation:

* **Missing Financial Data:** The lack of key financial metrics like revenue and gross profit severely hinders a full assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects.
* **Recent Market Conditions:**  Understanding the current market outlook and any recent news affecting Goldman Sachs (earnings reports, analyst opinions, regulatory changes, etc.) is crucial for accurate assessment.
* **Technical Indicators:** While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and recent downward divergence caution against solely relying on this indicator for investment decisions.
* **Long-Term Outlook:**  The projected long-term excess return (7.8%) is promising but highly dependent on the accuracy of the forecast.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data, Goldman Sachs exhibits past outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, a thorough analysis requires additional information on recent financial performance, market conditions, and analyst sentiment.  The currently available information paints an incomplete picture and prevents a definitive recommendation on whether to invest.  Further research is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
