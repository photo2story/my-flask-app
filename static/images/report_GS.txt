**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The provided data shows significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this performance.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **GS Cumulative Return:** 197.37%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 120.25%
* **Return Difference:** 77.12% (GS outperformed VOO by 77.12 percentage points).
* **Relative Divergence:** 95.5% (This indicates GS's current performance is at the 95.5th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500).  This high value suggests a significant degree of outperformance relative to its historical trend.


**Analysis of Alpha and Beta (Table Provided):**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  While some periods exhibit positive alpha (outperformance) and higher betas (higher volatility correlated to the market), others show negative alpha and/or lower betas. This indicates GS's performance is not consistently outperforming the market and varies based on market conditions.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) suggests overall growth of the company.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods demonstrates periods of strong growth, but it's also important to note periods of significant maximum drawdown (MDD).

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $633.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $600.84

The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a longer-term bullish trend.  The recent price change (-$0.51) is relatively minor and doesn't indicate a significant event like a sharp drop or rally.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 (Indicates a recent decrease in GS's relative strength compared to the S&P 500.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.7% (This is the expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 for a long-term investment, which suggests a modest outperformance. However, given the highly variable Alpha, this must be treated cautiously).

**Conclusion:**

Goldman Sachs has shown periods of significant outperformance against the S&P 500, as demonstrated by its high cumulative return and relative divergence. However, its alpha and beta values fluctuate considerably, indicating inconsistent market-beating performance. The recent price action shows a minor decrease, but the longer-term trend looks positive. The technical indicators are currently neutral, and the projected long-term excess return is modest.  A more comprehensive analysis, including fundamental factors and consideration of macroeconomic conditions, is necessary to form a complete investment opinion.  The historical data indicates high volatility, requiring careful consideration of risk tolerance.
