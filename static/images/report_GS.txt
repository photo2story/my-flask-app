## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Goldman Sachs (GS) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for GS is 167.99%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 37.39%. This results in a substantial difference of 130.6 percentage points. The relative divergence of 89.9% indicates GS's performance is in the upper 90th percentile compared to the S&P 500's historical performance.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 43.0% | 11.4% | 27.0% | 1.0 | 118.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 90.0% | 11.4% | 61.0% | 1.0 | 180.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 91.0% | 6.6% | 54.0% | 1.0 | 182.0 |

The consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significant alpha values suggest strong outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The beta of 1.0 indicates GS's price movements are highly correlated with the overall market.  However, the high alpha suggests it has generated excess returns beyond market movements.  Note that the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is relatively low, indicating resilience during market downturns.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 580.12
* **Last Market Price:** 580.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 578.25
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 577.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 565.95

The price is slightly above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively short-term bullish trend.  However, it is significantly above its 60-day moving average, indicating a stronger upward trend over the longer term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.66 (Slightly below neutral; not oversold but not strongly overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.0038 (Slightly negative, suggesting mild bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Index (20-day change):** +2.3% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 19.0% (S&P 500 outperformance)

The RSI is near the neutral level, not providing a strong signal. The slightly negative PPO confirms mild bearish momentum, but the positive change in relative strength and the strong expected return suggest potential for continued upward movement.  The given 580.00 closing price does not suggest any dramatic price movements (sharp jumps or drops).

**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available for GS in the provided materials.  A thorough financial analysis requires this crucial information.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Earnings News:**  Information about recent earnings announcements (within the last 2 days) is missing from the provided data.  This is a critical gap in the analysis.
* **Market Outlook:** Missing.
* **Analyst Opinions:** Missing.

The absence of this crucial information severely limits the depth of this analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has shown exceptional performance compared to the S&P 500, with a significantly higher cumulative return and strong alpha values. Technical indicators provide mixed signals, while the strong expected return is promising. However, the lack of crucial financial data (revenue, profit), recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions significantly hinders a complete and reliable investment recommendation.  Further investigation is necessary before making any investment decisions.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the incomplete data, a definitive buy/sell/hold recommendation cannot be provided.  The strong historical outperformance is encouraging, but the missing financial data and market context necessitate further due diligence.  Consult additional financial resources and reports to obtain a complete picture before making investment decisions.  The high expected return is compelling, but should be considered cautiously due to the incomplete analysis.
