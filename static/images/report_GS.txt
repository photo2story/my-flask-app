**2. Recent Price Movement:**

GS's current price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor downward trend. However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The negative change from the previous close (-0.82%) reflects a minor daily decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (87.12):**  Indicates the stock is significantly overbought, suggesting a potential correction is imminent.
* **PPO (0.48):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but the relatively low value compared to the high RSI needs further analysis.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-0.4):** Shows a recent short-term weakening in relative strength.

The provided `Last-market` data shows a small price drop (-0.82%), which is not significant enough to be considered a rapid decline.  The expected return of 0.6% over the long term (2+ years) represents a modest outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but the high RSI and recent relative divergence suggest caution.  The high level of historical outperformance may not be sustainable, leading to a more conservative outlook on future returns.  Further investigation and consideration of various risk factors are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
