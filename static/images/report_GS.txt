**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  GS significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, exhibiting a cumulative return of 93.63% compared to VOO's 61.54%.  The 32.1% difference is substantial and is further highlighted by the relative divergence of 69.1%, suggesting that this outperformance is relatively high compared to historical fluctuations between the two.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant variability in performance across different periods.  While some periods show substantial positive returns, others show negative returns.  The alpha values suggest periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (beta),  highlighting the volatility inherent in Goldman Sachs' performance.  The beta values are consistently high, indicating Goldman Sachs is more volatile than the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of GS ($487.31) is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a downtrend. The last market price ($489.66) shows a significant drop (-$5.26 or -1.02%) from the previous close, suggesting a recent negative price movement.  This is further supported by the negative PPO and the low RSI.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 32.23 is in oversold territory, suggesting the stock may be undervalued and potentially poised for a rebound. However, the negative PPO (-1.46) indicates bearish momentum.  The recent relative divergence change of -14.8% reflects a short-term downtrend. The MRI of 0.4271 indicates medium risk. The large negative change in the last market price (-$5.26) supports the observed downtrend and suggests a recent potential negative market event affecting the price.

The expected return of 5.5% above the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon suggests potential for outperformance relative to the market. However, this needs to be considered in the context of the current price and market risk.  The high volatility inherent in GS (as indicated by beta values) must also be factored into any investment decision.

**Conclusion:**

While GS has historically outperformed the S&P 500,  current indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. The oversold RSI might signal a potential rebound, but the negative PPO and recent price drop suggest caution.  The high volatility associated with GS demands a thorough risk assessment before any investment decisions.  The long-term expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 may provide a compelling case for long-term investors willing to tolerate that higher volatility.
