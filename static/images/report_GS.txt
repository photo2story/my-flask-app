## Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The provided data shows GS outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly, but with recent price decline and concerning technical indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** GS shows a cumulative return of 102.38%, significantly exceeding the S&P 500's 65.78% return.  The difference is 36.6%, placing it at the 73rd percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max 68.4%, min -49.2%).

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided table shows inconsistent alpha (ranging from -0.5 to 0.9), suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (Beta fluctuates as well, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements).  While recent years (2022-2024) show positive alpha, this needs to be considered in conjunction with other factors. Notably, high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) are observed in several periods, highlighting the risk associated with GS.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $489.80
* **Day Change:** -$5.24 (-1.01%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $481.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $537.30
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $590.75

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The significant drop from the previous close suggests potential negative market sentiment impacting GS.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk) suggesting moderate risk associated with current market conditions.
* **RSI:** 35.85 (Below 30 is generally considered oversold, indicating potential for a rebound, but it's also close to the oversold zone)
* **PPO:** -0.96 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence:** -0.5 (Short-term bearish trend).
* **Expected Return:** 4.9% This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment, implying potential outperformance despite current negativity.

**Conclusion:**

While GS has historically outperformed the S&P 500, the recent price decline, negative technical indicators (PPO, RSI, moving averages), and relatively high MDDs in the past raise some concerns. The relatively low MRI suggests moderate risk, yet the negative technical indicators combined with the significant price drop in the last trading day point to a potential period of short-term weakness.  The long-term expected return of 4.9% above the S&P 500 might still attract long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance. Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price drop and a comprehensive risk assessment are recommended before making any investment decisions.
