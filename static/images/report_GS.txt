## Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Stock Report

**Executive Summary:** Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  This report analyzes GS's recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), incorporating key financial metrics and technical indicators.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** GS (104.54%) significantly outperformed VOO (66.94%) over the measured period.  The difference in cumulative returns is 37.6%, placing it at the 73.8th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to VOO (max: 68.4%, min: -49.2%).

* **Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data reveals inconsistent alpha (ranging from -0.5 to 0.9) and beta (ranging from 0.0 to 1.09) values across different time periods. This indicates that GS's performance relative to the market has fluctuated considerably.  High beta values suggest higher volatility than the market.  Noteworthy is the generally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and the significant Maximum Drawdown (MDD) in some periods.  Market cap has increased steadily over the observed period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $516.87
* **5-day Moving Average:** $485.33
* **20-day Moving Average:** $539.05
* **60-day Moving Average:** $592.06

The closing price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent price increase from the previous close ($462.22) to $516.87 represents a significant jump of 11.82, indicating a recent upswing (a **sharp rebound**). This sudden movement might be a factor to consider when interpreting other indicators.


**3. Technical Indicators and Market Outlook:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk). This suggests elevated market risk associated with GS.

* **RSI:** 40.52.  This is nearing oversold territory (generally below 30), suggesting potential buying opportunities, but itâ€™s not definitively in that zone.

* **PPO:** -1.0981. A negative PPO indicates that the price is currently below the moving average, reinforcing the short-term bearish signal.

* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -10.1%.  The negative value confirms a recent downward trend in relative strength compared to the market.

* **Expected Return:** 4.8%. This represents a potential long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500.  However, this should be viewed with caution, as it doesn't account for potential market shifts or risk.


**Conclusion:**

Goldman Sachs has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but its recent performance shows mixed signals.  While the recent price jump suggests a possible short-term uptrend, several indicators (MRI, PPO, RSI) point towards a more bearish outlook.  The long-term expected return remains positive relative to the market, but investors should carefully consider the high risk (MRI) and volatile nature of GS before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent price jump would be beneficial.
