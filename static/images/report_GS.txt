A dollar-cost averaging approach, as suggested by the hybrid signal, could be a prudent strategy to mitigate risk. The MRI is High, which suggests this might be a good time to invest from market conditions, and the RSI indicates that prices may be oversold which may make this a good opportunity to buy.
