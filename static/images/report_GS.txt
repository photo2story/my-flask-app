*   **Negatives:** Recent price weakness, high maximum drawdown values (indicating risk), decreasing relative spread change, "Hold" analyst consensus.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data, it might be prudent to take a cautious approach. While GS has shown strong historical performance, recent price action and technical indicators suggest short-term challenges.
*   **If you hold GS:** Consider holding, as the long-term outlook is positive, but monitor the situation closely.
*   **If you are considering buying GS:**  Averaging down from a longer-term perspective. The RSI being closer to oversold may present an opportunity to buy. Consider the news about the Chief Credit Strategist leaving - this could introduce some uncertainty in the short term.  The analyst consensus of "Hold" with a target price above the current price suggests potential, but waiting for further confirmation of an upward trend might be wise.
