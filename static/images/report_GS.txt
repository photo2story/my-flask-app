**Conclusion:**

While GS has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, current indicators present a mixed picture.  The high MRI and negative PPO suggest elevated risk and bearish momentum.  However, the RSI suggests that the stock might be oversold, and the recent price increase, combined with the positive relative divergence, points to a short-term upward trend. Long-term investors should carefully consider the high risk indicated by the MRI,  volatility demonstrated by high Beta,  and weigh these factors against the potential for higher long-term returns.  Further analysis beyond the provided data is recommended before making any investment decisions.
