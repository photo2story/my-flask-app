**6. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta data show mixed results over different periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others show negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The Beta consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting low sensitivity to market movements.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

GS shows significant long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a substantial cumulative return difference. However, recent price action indicates a potential short-term bearish trend, supported by oversold RSI and negative PPO readings.  The lack of current financial data, earnings news, and market outlook information prevents a definitive conclusion. The expected 8.5% outperformance over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is promising, but requires careful consideration of the risks associated with the current market conditions and the company's future prospects.  Further investigation into the recent news and financial data is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The current price might be viewed as an entry point for long-term investors if the overall market outlook is positive, though additional due diligence is absolutely necessary.
