* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +4.78 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

**Expected Return:** 0.12% – This represents a long-term (2+ years) expected excess return over the S&P 500,  assuming consistent outperformance as historically indicated. This is a low figure and should be interpreted cautiously due to inherent market risks.
