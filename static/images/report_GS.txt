*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates but generally trends upwards, peaking at 1.7 during 2019-2021. This suggests GS's volatility compared to the market has increased.  A Beta around 1 suggests GS moves largely in line with the market, while values above 1 indicate higher volatility than the market.

Goldman Sachs has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative return. However, there's substantial volatility, indicated by the MDD numbers, and some performance fluctuation shown in Alpha. The recent price action indicates some short-term downward momentum, but the overall trend appears positive, supported by the longer-term moving averages and positive PPO.

The MRI suggests a medium risk profile. Analyst consensus is a "Hold," and the average target price is slightly above the current price, implying a modest upside.

The recent news regarding Goldman's expansion into private equity credit is a positive catalyst.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, a cautious approach is recommended. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk, especially given the historical volatility of GS. The news regarding private equity credit expansion and the positive expected return (2.8% over S&P 500 long term) are encouraging.
