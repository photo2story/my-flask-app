The provided data shows GS significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered, with a cumulative return 34.66% higher than VOO. The relative divergence of 74.5% highlights that this outperformance is considerable compared to the historical range of performance differences.

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals mixed performance. While some periods show negative alpha (underperformance relative to the market, considering risk), the most recent periods (2021-2025) show a consistently positive alpha, indicating outperformance adjusted for risk.  The beta consistently exceeds 1, suggesting higher volatility than the market.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over the period. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows variability, highlighting periods of strong growth and periods of stagnation or decline. The maximum drawdown (MDD) figures indicate considerable risk at times.

* **Expected Return:** 4.0% (This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2 years or more) with a long term investment strategy).


**Conclusion:**

Goldman Sachs has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, supported by recent positive alpha.  However, the recent price action shows a slight downward trend, and the technical indicators present a mixed picture. The relatively low RSI and negative divergence, combined with the recent drop in price, suggest potential short term downside.  However, the positive long-term expected return and relatively low market risk rating might still support a long-term investment strategy.  Further analysis of the company's fundamentals and the broader market conditions is warranted before making any investment decisions.  The relatively high Beta suggests a riskier investment compared to the market as a whole.
