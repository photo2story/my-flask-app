## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Investment Review

This report analyzes Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Goldman Sachs' cumulative return (166.86%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.85%) over the measured period.  The difference is 46.0%, placing it at the 85.4th percentile of historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This suggests strong outperformance relative to the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is $574.68.  The stock price is currently below its 5-day ($586.13), 20-day ($593.50), and 60-day ($548.71) moving averages. This indicates a recent downward trend, although the price is above the 60-day moving average, suggesting potential support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (25.73):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO (-0.88):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-4.9):** Shows a recent weakening in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (8.2%):** This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 with long-term (2+ years)  investing. Considering the current price ($574.68) is below its recent moving averages and the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the market may be incorporating negative news.  A significant price jump would likely require a reversal of this current negative momentum and would merit further investigation.

**4. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available for analysis. This significantly limits the assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects.  More financial data is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided data lacks information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This gap significantly hampers a complete investment assessment. Access to this information is essential for informed decision-making.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has historically outperformed the S&P 500. However, recent price action shows a downward trend,  supported by bearish technical indicators (PPO negative, RSI oversold but still low).  The lack of financial data and recent news makes a definitive recommendation difficult.  The projected excess return of 8.2% for long-term investors is promising but should be weighed against the current market conditions and the absence of crucial fundamental data.  Further investigation is needed to determine if the current price reflects intrinsic value, considering the apparent negative market sentiment.  More specifically, access to recent news, earnings releases, and financial data is essential before forming a conclusive opinion.  The oversold RSI may indicate a short-term buying opportunity, but the bearish trend should be carefully monitored.
