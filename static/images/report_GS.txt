* **Expected Return:** 0.6% (This is the expected *excess* return over the S&P 500 for a long-term investment (2+ years).  It is a relatively low expected excess return given the currently high RSI.  This suggests caution;  a high RSI combined with a low expected return may indicate a possible near-term decline.)


**Conclusion:**

While GS has historically outperformed the S&P 500, the current high RSI and recent price dip suggest caution. The relatively low expected excess return, despite the historical outperformance, further reinforces the need for a cautious approach.  While long-term investment may be considered, careful monitoring of the market and technical indicators is crucial.  The recent price decline (-$0.82), while not drastic, contributes to the overall cautious outlook.
