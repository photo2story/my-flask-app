## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The provided data shows GS significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **GS Cumulative Return:** 135.89%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** 53.32% (GS outperformed VOO by 53.32 percentage points).
* **Relative Divergence:** 82.2%  This indicates that GS's current outperformance relative to VOO is at the 82.2nd percentile of its historical range of outperformance/underperformance.  While this suggests strong relative performance, it doesn't guarantee future outperformance.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results across different periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, represented by beta), others display negative alpha, suggesting underperformance.  The beta fluctuates significantly, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements over time. A high beta (e.g., 67.4 in 2015-2017) suggests greater volatility compared to the market.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally been increasing throughout the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $545.37
* **Last Market Price:** $566.10 (a recent increase of 2.22%)  This represents a sharp uptick from the previous close.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $521.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $514.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $573.73

The last market price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend.  However, the 60-day MA being significantly higher indicates a recent pullback from higher levels. The price difference between the closing price and the last market price should be clarified. 


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.75 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.325 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +7.6% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 4.3% (This is the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term investment (2+ years)).

The recent price increase of 2.22% shows a modest short-term uptrend. This, coupled with a positive PPO and increasing relative divergence, is generally bullish.  However, the relatively high 60-day moving average suggests the stock could be consolidating or experiencing a temporary rebound.  The MRI indicates moderate risk, prompting caution.  The positive expected return of 4.3% relative to the S&P 500, however, remains promising for long-term investors.  More detailed analysis, including consideration of current market conditions and the company's fundamentals, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
