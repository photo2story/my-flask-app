**7. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  Alpha generally remains positive, signifying potential outperformance relative to the market.  Beta fluctuates around 1, indicating sensitivity to market movements.  However, this analysis needs more context and is limited without revenue, profit, and current earnings information.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs (GS) has historically outperformed the S&P 500, with the current divergence being significant.  However, the absence of crucial financial data (earnings, revenue, gross profit) makes a complete assessment impossible.  While technical indicators suggest short-term downward pressure but longer-term upward potential,  a thorough analysis requires access to complete financial statements and current news.  The expected return is modest (0.12%), suggesting a balanced view on the company's future performance relative to its benchmark.  Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is necessary for making informed investment decisions.  The substantial fluctuations in alpha and beta over the years deserve further investigation to understand their underlying causes.
