* **20-Day Moving Average:** $578.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $566.28

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.84 –  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.8% – This represents the expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. Given the significant historical outperformance, this number appears conservative, and further investigation into its calculation method is recommended.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has historically outperformed the S&P 500, as evidenced by a considerably higher cumulative return.  However, this performance has been volatile, and the provided data does not offer a complete financial picture.  The recent price action suggests a potential short-term uptrend, but technical indicators are neutral. The expected return of 0.8% over the long term seems conservative given the historical data but requires more context regarding calculation methodology. The lack of recent news, financial statements, and detailed market outlook makes a definitive recommendation difficult.  Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to obtain comprehensive financial data, analyze current market conditions, and review recent news and analyst reports concerning Goldman Sachs.  The high beta in several periods suggests that the firm is significantly exposed to market risk.
