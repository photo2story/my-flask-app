The currently available data only shows historical performance and some technical indicators, which is insufficient for a complete assessment.

Given the significant data gaps, providing specific investment recommendations would be irresponsible. Before making any investment decisions, further research is mandatory to obtain missing data points and develop a full understanding of the company's financial health, current market position, and future prospects.  A comprehensive analysis including fundamental and technical indicators would be necessary to formulate a sound investment strategy.  Consult with a financial advisor before investing.
