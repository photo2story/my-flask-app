**1. Performance Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  Over the observed period, GS significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return of 89.90%, compared to VOO's 71.02%.  This represents a difference of 18.88%. The relative divergence of 65.8% suggests that this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500. However, note that this is a snapshot in time and past performance does not guarantee future results.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, and Beta values across different time periods paint a more nuanced picture.  While recent years (2021-2025) show strong positive CAGR and a positive alpha, indicating outperformance relative to the market benchmark, earlier periods show periods of underperformance (negative CAGR and negative alpha). The high beta values generally indicate a high sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has also shown consistent growth over the periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $470.81
* **Previous Close:** $511.23
* **Daily Change:** -$7.91 (-1.55%)  This represents a significant daily drop.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $527.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $546.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $596.23

The current price is significantly below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend. The large daily drop of $7.91 also indicates a recent downward price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk category)
* **RSI:** 28.77 (Significantly below 30, suggesting oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -0.9493 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -12.0% (Short-term downward trend confirmed.)
* **Expected Return:** -2.5% (This is a short-term expectation, and the negative value aligns with the current bearish trend.)
* **Long-Term Expected Return vs. S&P 500:** The provided data doesn't directly quantify long-term (2+ years) excess returns over the S&P 500.  However, the historical alpha values suggest potential for outperformance in some periods, but also the risk of underperformance in others.  Further analysis would be needed to assess potential long-term excess returns.

**Conclusion:**

GS has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 historically, but recent price action indicates a bearish short-term trend.  The low RSI and negative PPO suggest the stock may be oversold, potentially setting up a short-term buying opportunity for some investors. However, the high Market Risk Indicator and recent sharp decline warrant caution. A long-term investment decision requires a thorough analysis beyond this snapshot, considering the risk tolerance and time horizon.  The historical data indicates potential for both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market, so a comprehensive assessment is essential.
