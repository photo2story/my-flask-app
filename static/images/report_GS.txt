The provided alpha and beta values show mixed results across different time periods. While alpha is consistently around 0.1, indicating slight outperformance, the beta varies considerably, suggesting sensitivity to market movements changes over time.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance shows a short-term decline.  The RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially setting up a short-term bounce. However, the negative PPO and the price being below its moving averages indicate bearish momentum. The lack of crucial financial data and recent news makes a definitive conclusion challenging.  The projected long-term outperformance (8.5%) is promising, but investors should be prepared for potential volatility, as indicated by the historical data.  Further investigation into recent news, financial statements, and analyst ratings is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The current oversold condition may present a buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance, but short-term investors should proceed with caution.
