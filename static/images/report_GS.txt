* **60-Day Moving Average:** $599.88

The price is currently below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, it is still above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend may still be in place.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.51 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.10 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** 0.7% (This is a modest expected outperformance over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with continuous investment. This should be considered within the context of the inherent risks.)

The recent price drop is relatively small and shouldn't be considered a significant negative event. The positive PPO and slightly above-neutral RSI suggest ongoing bullish momentum, though a confirmation of a reversal to an upward trend might need further confirmation. The positive 20-day relative divergence change supports the short-term upward trend. The relatively low expected return suggests that while outperformance is expected, it is not significantly large.
