**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available in the provided information.  Further financial data is needed for a complete fundamental analysis.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  The analysis needs details on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to provide a comprehensive assessment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

GS has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, indicated by a significantly higher cumulative return.  However, its beta suggests substantial volatility.  Recent price action shows a bullish short-term trend, although the PPO indicates bearish momentum, and the RSI is approaching overbought territory.  A lack of key financial data prevents a complete fundamental analysis.  More information is needed on recent news and analyst sentiment to form a complete investment recommendation.  The high expected return of 3.5% over the S&P 500 is encouraging, but long term investment horizons should be considered given the significant risk implied by the high beta.
