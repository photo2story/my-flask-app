## Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Goldman Sachs (GS) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for GS is 162.88%, while the VOO's cumulative return is 116.71%. This represents a difference of **46.2%**.  The relative divergence of 85.5% indicates GS's performance lies in the upper 85.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.

The provided CAGR data shows significant variability in GS's performance compared to the benchmark.  While periods of strong outperformance are evident (e.g., 2019-2021), other periods show underperformance or even negative returns (e.g., 2017-2019).  The consistently low alpha (around 0.1) suggests that while it outperformed the market over the total period considered, this outperformance may not be entirely attributable to superior stock-picking. The beta consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting low correlation with the market, potentially explaining the periodic underperformance.  It is important to consider that these are historical data and may not be indicative of future performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $566.10
* **5-day Moving Average:** $566.27
* **20-day Moving Average:** $589.48
* **60-day Moving Average:** $551.90

The stock price is currently below both its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  This could suggest a temporary pullback.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 30.34 – This suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.16 –  A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.5% – Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.

The current price of $566.10, being below the moving averages, doesn't suggest a dramatic event (no significant spike or crash). The expected return of 8.5% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is optimistic given the historical volatility and low alpha. It's crucial to temper this expectation with realistic risk assessment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has demonstrated periods of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this performance is not consistent.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downtrend, despite being in oversold territory (RSI).  The lack of financial statement data hinders a thorough assessment of the company's intrinsic value. The projected 8.5% long-term outperformance needs to be validated by more detailed fundamental and market analysis. Further research on recent news, earnings, and analyst opinions is essential before making any investment decision.  The consistently low alpha raises concerns about the sustainability of its outperformance relative to the broader market.  Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before investing.
