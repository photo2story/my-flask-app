**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $509.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $502.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $524.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $581.05

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, the recent price increase of $2.09 indicates a slight upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.99 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively oversold)

* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +3.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 5.0% (This is a long-term (2+ years) expected excess return over the S&P 500. The short term price action doesn't align with this expected return, highlighting the inherent uncertainties of investing)


The recent price increase of $2.09 from the previous close is a small, positive change and doesn't constitute a significant "급반등" (sharp rebound) or "급하락" (sharp decline).

**Conclusion:**

GS has historically shown periods of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but also periods of underperformance.  While the current relative divergence is high, the recent price action and technical indicators present a mixed signal. The long-term expected return is positive but requires confirmation from fundamental analysis and further consideration of market volatility. The risk assessment (MRI) indicates a moderate level of risk. Further in-depth analysis is recommended before making any investment decisions.
