**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent price action suggests a downward trend.  Technical indicators show the stock is oversold, implying a potential rebound.  However, the negative PPO and recent relative divergence suggest bearish momentum. The significant difference between the current price and moving averages further reinforces this downward trend.  Long-term investors might see value due to the potential for outperformance and the current low RSI level, but current downward movement should be monitored before investing.  The lack of financial statement data limits a thorough assessment of the company's financial health.   A comprehensive analysis requires up-to-date financial news and further financial data.  The 8.7% expected return needs to be considered in conjunction with the significant risk implied by current indicators.
