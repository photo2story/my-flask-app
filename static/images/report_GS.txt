## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Stock Analysis

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The analysis below summarizes GS's performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), considering various financial metrics and technical indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

* **GS Cumulative Return:** 103.82%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.27%
* **Return Difference:** 37.6% (GS outperformed VOO by 37.6 percentage points).
* **Relative Divergence:** 73.8% (This indicates GS's performance is in the upper 73.8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500).  The high relative divergence suggests GS has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the considered period, but this doesn't guarantee future outperformance.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows fluctuating performance across different periods.  While some periods show significant outperformance (e.g., 2019-2021), others reveal underperformance or even negative returns (e.g., 2016-2018, 2017-2019). The Alpha values suggest periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (Beta reflects market sensitivity).  Note that past performance is not indicative of future results. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows significant growth over the periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $507.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $502.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $530.39
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $585.26

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase ($0.78) from the previous close is relatively small compared to the distance from the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)  This suggests a moderate level of market risk.

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.87  This is below 40, indicating the stock might be oversold, although RSI should be used in conjunction with other indicators.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0877  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +6.2%  This implies a short-term upward trend relative to the benchmark.


* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:**  Not provided in the input data.

* **Expected Return:** 4.9%  This represents an expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment. The provided data doesn't clarify the methodology used for calculating this expected return.

**Overall Assessment:**

While GS has shown periods of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, the recent price action and technical indicators suggest a cautious outlook. The stock is currently trading below its moving averages, RSI indicates potential oversold conditions, and PPO shows bearish momentum. However, the positive expected return over the long term and relatively low market risk might still make it an attractive investment for long-term investors with risk tolerance.
