## Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Investment Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The cumulative return for GS is 172.26%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 121.78%. The difference is 50.5%, placing it at the 89.6th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests a strong outperformance historically, though past performance does not guarantee future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $586.33
* **5-day Moving Average:** $588.20
* **20-day Moving Average:** $594.02
* **60-day Moving Average:** $547.38

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.75 (suggests the stock may be oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.77 (suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -4.0% (indicates a recent decline)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 7.8% over the long term (2+ years). This is a potential alpha, assuming a long-term investment strategy.

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the recent price decline, suggest a potentially bearish short-term outlook.  However, the long-term expected return of 7.8% above the S&P 500 warrants consideration.  The current price of $586.33 does not represent a significant rapid increase or decrease in price considering the moving averages.

**6. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show that Goldman Sachs generally exhibits a small positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and a beta above 1 (higher volatility than the market).  However, the values vary from year to year and some years show negative alpha. This highlights the need for careful consideration of risk and volatility alongside the potential for outperformance.

**7. Summary:**

Goldman Sachs has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showcasing significant cumulative returns.  However, recent price action indicates a short-term bearish trend, supported by some technical indicators.  The lack of recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions prevents a complete assessment of the current situation.  The long-term expected return is positive relative to the S&P 500 (7.8%), suggesting potential for long-term growth. A deeper dive into the financial statements and recent news is crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.  The high beta suggests greater risk than simply investing in the S&P 500.
