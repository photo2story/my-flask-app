## Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  Over the analyzed period, GS has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for GS is 155.53%, while the VOO's cumulative return is 114.36%. This represents a difference of 41.2%, placing it at the 80.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the VOO (based on the provided max and min divergence).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

GS's closing price is $550.25.  The stock is currently trading below its 5-day ($577.67), 20-day ($592.08), and 60-day ($549.62) moving averages. This suggests a recent downward trend.  The price is slightly above the 60-day MA, indicating some support at that level.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (18.06):**  This extremely low RSI value suggests the stock is significantly oversold. This could signal a potential bounce but also indicates a high level of risk.

* **PPO (-1.18):** A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.  This aligns with the downward trend observed in the moving averages.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-11.2%):**  The negative value shows a recent decrease in GS's relative strength against the VOO.

* **Expected Return (8.8%):**  The projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500 is positive but moderate, suggesting potential for outperformance, but  with inherent risks given the current oversold conditions.  This expectation, however, depends critically on the accuracy of the provided model.

The current price of $550.25, while below recent moving averages, doesn't necessarily indicate a dramatic price drop (although it suggests a downward trend).  More data is needed to confirm this assessment.

**4. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data was provided.  Without this crucial financial information, a complete fundamental analysis cannot be conducted. Access to balance sheets and income statements is required to provide a thorough assessment.

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided information lacks recent news, earnings announcements, market outlook details, and analyst opinions.  This critical information gap prevents a comprehensive analysis of current market sentiment and potential future performance.  To get a complete picture, access to up-to-date financial news sources is required.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs (GS) has historically outperformed the S&P 500 but is currently experiencing a bearish trend. Technical indicators point towards an oversold condition (RSI) and negative momentum (PPO).  The lack of recent financial statements and news prevents a full assessment of the underlying financial health and market expectations for GS.  The projected long-term outperformance, while positive, should be viewed cautiously due to the current downward trend and missing data.  Further investigation is required to assess whether the current low price presents a buying opportunity or if further downside is likely. Before making any investment decisions, it is crucial to obtain the missing financial data and news information and conduct a thorough analysis.  Consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
