## Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Investment Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The cumulative return for GS is 165.05%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 117.56%.  The difference is 47.5%, placing it in the 86.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on provided data.  This suggests strong relative performance, though this is not indicative of future performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $570.78
* **Last Market Price:** $582.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $563.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $588.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $553.14

The current price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, the price is above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, showing some support.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price ($582.79 - $570.78 = $12.01) indicates a recent price increase and this should be considered a potential data point when evaluating recent changes. The price increase reflects a potential short term market reaction which does not indicate future price action.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.51 (Suggests the stock may be oversold, but further confirmation is needed.)
* **PPO:** -0.98 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -2.8% (Short-term bearish trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 8.4% (This represents an expected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, but this should not be taken as a guarantee of returns.)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum.  The negative change in relative strength confirms the short-term bearish trend.  The expected return is positive, but relies on past performances and requires a long-term horizon. The provided data does not reflect the risk associated with this investment.



**4. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available in the provided information.  Further financial analysis is impossible without this critical data.


**5. News and Recent Issues:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has demonstrated strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, recent technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. The lack of crucial financial data (revenue, gross profit) and missing news/analyst information significantly limits the scope of this analysis.  The provided expected return is based on a long-term outlook (2+ years) and should not be considered guaranteed.  Before making any investment decision, thorough due diligence is crucial, including reviewing recent financial statements, earnings reports, news articles, and analyst reports to gain a comprehensive understanding of GS's current situation and future prospects.  The provided data is insufficient for a complete investment recommendation.
