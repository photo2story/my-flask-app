**Conclusion:**

GS has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but its recent performance shows a short-term downtrend.  The relatively low RSI and positive short-term divergence suggest potential for a short-term recovery. However, the inconsistent alpha values highlight the volatility of its performance relative to the broader market. The projected long-term outperformance suggests GS may still be a worthwhile investment for long-term investors with a tolerance for moderate risk.  Further due diligence and analysis are recommended before making investment decisions.
