**Company Overview:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.


**Performance Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, exhibiting a cumulative return of 166.68% compared to the S&P 500's 108.99%.  The relative divergence of 78.4% highlights that this outperformance is substantial relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.  However, the recent price action shows a decline.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  High alpha values (e.g., 1.0 or 1.1 in recent years) suggest GS has outperformed the market significantly in those periods, while negative alpha indicates underperformance. Beta values generally hover around 1, suggesting GS's volatility is comparable to the market, except for some periods of higher volatility. Note that the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values also show periods of strong growth alongside significant market corrections. This underlines the inherent risk in investing in financial services.  The market capitalization (Cap) steadily increased over the years reflecting the growth of the company.

**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $581.14
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $605.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $633.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $606.72

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The significant drop from the previous close ($605.26 to $581.14) represents a substantial negative change, indicating a sharp decline in price.


**Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 29.58 is in oversold territory, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued and a potential bounce might be expected. However, the negative PPO (-1.26) indicates bearish momentum. This combination suggests caution. The negative 20-day relative divergence change further supports a short-term bearish trend.


**Conclusion:**

While GS has historically outperformed the S&P 500 considerably, recent price action shows a sharp decline. Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold market, but negative momentum prevails.  The expected return of 1.1% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is modest.  Investors should carefully consider these factors along with their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Further research into the reasons for the recent decline is strongly recommended.
