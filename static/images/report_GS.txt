**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 76.24 – This suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating a potential short-term pullback.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.02 – A positive value indicates bullish momentum, but the value is close to zero, suggesting the momentum may be weakening.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +13.14 – This points to a recent period of strong relative outperformance compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 0.13% -  This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment at the current valuation.  The relatively low expected return despite past outperformance is likely due to current market conditions and valuation levels.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

Unfortunately, no earnings data is available in the provided information.  Analysis of recent performance is impossible without this crucial data.  Access to financial news sources and company filings is required for this analysis.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but the current high RSI and proximity of the PPO to zero suggest a potential short-term correction. The recent price surge raises concern of overvaluation and potential vulnerability to a rapid decline. The lack of available earnings data and financial information prevents a comprehensive assessment of the company's fundamental performance and valuation.  Crucially,  a review of recent news, earnings reports, and analyst opinions is essential to evaluate the current market outlook and assess the risks and opportunities associated with investing in GS.
