## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Stock Review

This report analyzes Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Goldman Sachs' cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference is 51.0%, placing its relative performance in the 90th percentile of historical data based on the provided range.  While this indicates strong outperformance, the relative strength should be considered within the context of the historical volatility of the comparison.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

GS's closing price is $585.48.  The stock is currently trading below its 5-day ($589.76), 20-day ($594.23), and 60-day ($545.87) moving averages. This suggests a recent downward trend, although the price is above the longer-term 60-day average.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (34.93):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential buying opportunity, but not necessarily a strong buy signal.

* **PPO (-0.76):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-5.0):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative strength.

* **Expected Return (7.7%):**  This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 assuming a consistent investment strategy.  However, this is an estimate and actual returns may vary significantly.  The provided closing price of 585.48 doesn't trigger a "sharp rebound or decline" indicator within this context.  Further analysis beyond the provided metrics is required for such conclusion.

**4. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data are available for GS in the provided information. A more comprehensive financial analysis is needed.  (Need to provide data to fill in this section)

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions to be populated. Please provide this data.)


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered. However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, indicated by the stock trading below its moving averages and a negative PPO. The RSI suggests the stock might be approaching oversold territory.  The lack of financial data prevents a comprehensive assessment.  The provided expected return of 7.7% over the long term compared to the S&P 500 is promising but dependent on various market factors.  A deeper dive into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a complete investment decision.
