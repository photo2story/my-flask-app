## Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Stock Analysis

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The provided data shows GS significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a substantial cumulative return difference.  However, recent price action indicates a potential short-term downturn.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** GS: 89.90%, VOO: 71.02%.  GS outperformed VOO by 18.88 percentage points.  The relative divergence suggests GS's performance is positioned in the upper 65.8th percentile relative to its historical performance against the VOO.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The table shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  While some periods show negative alpha (underperforming the market after adjusting for beta), recent periods (2021-2025) show consistently positive alpha, indicating outperformance relative to the market.  Beta values generally indicate moderate to high market sensitivity.  Significant fluctuations in both alpha and beta highlight GS's sensitivity to market conditions and its active management strategies. The high CAGR values in certain periods also contribute to the significant overall outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $470.81
* **5-day Moving Average:** $527.98
* **20-day Moving Average:** $546.76
* **60-day Moving Average:** $596.23

The closing price is significantly below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short term.  The substantial drop from the previous close ($511.23 to $470.81, a -7.91 change) signals a recent sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk) – indicates a relatively high level of risk associated with the market.

* **RSI:** 28.77 – This value is below 30, which is generally considered oversold territory, suggesting potential for a short-term rebound.

* **PPO:** -0.95 – A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.

* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** -12.0 (Short-term Downward Trend)

* **Expected Return:** -2.5% – This suggests a negative expected return in the very near term, reflecting current market sentiment.  However, the long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not explicitly stated but implied to be positive given the historical outperformance.

**Overall Assessment:**

While GS has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, the recent sharp price drop, negative PPO, low RSI, and high MRI suggest a high-risk, short-term bearish trend.  The negative expected return reinforces this short-term outlook. The long-term outlook, however, remains potentially positive given the historical alpha generation, although this requires further analysis beyond the current data set.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk before making any investment decisions, potentially looking for a more supportive price level before entering a long position.
