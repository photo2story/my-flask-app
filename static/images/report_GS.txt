## Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Stock Analysis

**Company Overview:** Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

The cumulative return of GS (203.49%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (121.84%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 81.6%, placing it at the 99th percentile of historical relative divergence (based on a minimum difference of -45.1% and a maximum of 82.9%).  This suggests GS has substantially outperformed the market benchmark.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent Alpha and Beta values across different periods.  While some periods exhibit positive alpha (outperformance beyond market beta), others show negative alpha. This suggests that GS's performance relative to the market has been variable over time.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over the period.  A more in-depth analysis of the factors driving these alpha and beta variations is necessary for a complete understanding.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods should be contrasted against the significant maximum drawdown (MDD) experienced in others, indicating substantial risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $660.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $651.25
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $642.34
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $604.02

The closing price is above all three moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend.  However, the relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day and 20-day moving averages suggests the upward momentum may be weakening.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 67.75 –  Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, potentially indicating a short-term pullback.  However, it's not excessively high, and further analysis is needed to confirm this.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.10 – A negative value indicates bearish momentum. This aligns with the negative recent relative divergence.

* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.0 – This indicates a recent short-term decline in the stock's relative performance against the S&P 500.

* **Price Change:** The recent price change (1.79%) indicates a small upward movement. This is not considered a significant "sharp increase."

* **Expected Return:** 0.7% – This represents the expected excess return above the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming current trends continue. However, this is a very low figure and requires further investigation.  It is not clear if this accounts for the risks observed in the MDD data.

**Conclusion:**

GS has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but its performance has been volatile. While the recent price movement shows some upward momentum, technical indicators suggest caution.  The relatively small positive expected return and potentially overbought conditions warrant further investigation before making any investment decisions. The high historical MDD values clearly indicate significant risk.  A deeper dive into fundamental analysis and a consideration of broader market conditions are crucial before drawing any firm conclusions.
