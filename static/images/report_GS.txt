## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Stock Performance Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns for GS compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  However, the high relative divergence suggests that GS's performance has been unusually strong compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **GS Cumulative Return:** 208.83%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 122.48%
* **Return Difference:** 86.4% (GS outperformed VOO by 86.4 percentage points)
* **Relative Divergence:** 100.0% (This indicates GS's current outperformance is at the extreme high end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500).

**Analysis of Alpha and Beta (Table):**

The table shows varying performance characteristics of GS over different time periods.  Noteworthy points:

* **High CAGR Variability:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) fluctuates significantly, highlighting the volatility inherent in GS's performance.  Periods of exceptional growth are followed by periods of stagnation or even negative returns.
* **Mixed Alpha:** Alpha, a measure of risk-adjusted return, shows both positive and negative values, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.
* **Beta near 1:** Beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, generally hovers around 1, suggesting that GS's price movements tend to correlate with the overall market. However, some periods show less correlation (Beta significantly different from 1).
* **Increasing Market Cap:**  The market capitalization (Cap) consistently increased over the years, showing growth in the company's size and valuation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $672.19
* **5-day Moving Average:** $655.59
* **20-day Moving Average:** $644.65
* **60-day Moving Average:** $605.47

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price change (+1.76%) further supports this.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (70.48):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally above 70), suggesting potential for a near-term pullback.
* **PPO (0.029):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but relatively low value suggesting momentum may be waning.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+3.2):** Shows a recent increase in relative strength, confirming the short-term uptrend.  The positive change further solidifies the short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.6%):**  This represents a modest expected return above the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This low expected return could be partly due to the current high relative divergence:  high past performance makes it difficult to expect the same future performance.

**Conclusion:**

GS has demonstrated periods of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, its performance is volatile, and the current high relative divergence suggests a potential for mean reversion.  While the short-term technical indicators are bullish, the RSI nearing overbought territory warrants caution. The modest long-term expected return, considering the high relative divergence, highlights the risk associated with its current valuation.  Further analysis incorporating fundamental factors is recommended before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment strategy, recognizing inherent volatility, might be considered, but risk management is crucial.
