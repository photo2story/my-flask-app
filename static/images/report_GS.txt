*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) varies significantly across the periods.  Recent periods (2019-2025) show very strong growth.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is relatively high, especially in periods affected by market downturns, indicating significant potential for loss.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing excess return relative to the market, is generally positive, especially in recent years, suggesting that GS is generating returns above what would be expected based on market movements alone.  However, earlier periods show negative alpha, indicating underperformance during those times.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates. A beta near 1 suggests market-like volatility, while values above 1 indicate higher volatility and below 1 lower volatility than the market. The shifting beta suggests changing sensitivity to the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally increased over the period, reflecting GS's growth.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **60-day Moving Average:** 629.13

The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a short-term pullback within a longer-term uptrend. The relatively small price change compared to the previous close doesn't indicate a major volatility event *at this specific point*.

### 5. Overall Assessment

Goldman Sachs (GS) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) historically, and especially in the most recent periods, but with considerable volatility. The recent price action shows a slight pullback, and the technical indicators present a mixed picture: low market risk, neutral momentum, but a cautious hybrid signal. The news flow indicates heightened volatility and the potential for significant events to impact the stock price.

**Recommendation:**

Given the strong historical outperformance, positive long-term expected return, and low market risk indicated by the MRI, GS may be a suitable investment for long-term investors. However, the high MDD, recent volatility, and cautious hybrid signal suggest that investors should be prepared for potential price swings. Monitor news and company announcements closely and consider the increased cash allocation recommended by the hybrid signal. Investors should also be aware that the relatively high relative divergence suggests a possible mean reversion in the future.
