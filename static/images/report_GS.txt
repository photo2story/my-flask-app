**Company Overview:** Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities and financial services firm.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  While recent years (2019-2024) show strong CAGR and positive Alpha, earlier periods experienced negative Alpha and lower returns.

The stock price is currently below both its short-term (5-day and 20-day) moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a positive longer-term trend. The small difference between the closing price and the last market price ($3.94) doesn't signal a significant immediate price swing.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 25.73 - This low RSI suggests the stock is currently oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
* PPO: -0.8757 -  A negative PPO signals bearish momentum.
* Recent Relative Strength Change: -4.9 -  The decreasing relative strength over the last 20 days reinforces the short-term downward trend.
* Expected Return: 8.2% -  Despite current market conditions, the long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 remains positive and substantial.

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available to analyze quarterly performance.  This lack of information limits a comprehensive financial assessment.

**7. Summary:**

GS has demonstrated strong long-term performance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest short-term weakness. The low RSI signals a potential oversold condition, which could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors.  The positive long-term expected return further supports this view. However, the lack of revenue and profit data, along with missing news and analyst information, hinders a complete assessment.  Further investigation into these areas is crucial before making any investment decisions.


**8. Overall Recommendation:**

While the long-term outlook for GS appears positive, the recent downward trend and lack of key financial data warrant caution. Further research, including analyzing the latest earnings reports, market outlook, and analyst opinions, is highly recommended before making an investment decision. The current oversold condition may present a buying opportunity for long-term investors, but a thorough understanding of the company's financials and recent developments is crucial.
