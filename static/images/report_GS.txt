**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

Unfortunately, no earnings data is available in the provided information.  A comprehensive analysis of Goldman Sachs' recent financial performance and future outlook requires access to their financial statements and analyst reports.  This is a crucial missing piece of the analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available, preventing a complete financial analysis.  Detailed financial statements are needed for a thorough assessment of the company's financial health.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

I lack access to real-time information, including news sources like Shacknews or Finbold. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of recent earnings news, market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights within the last two days.  To gain this insight, you should consult reputable financial news websites and analyst reports.


**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs (GS) has exhibited strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the period reviewed, but this analysis is significantly hampered by the absence of crucial financial data.  The high RSI suggests potential overbought conditions, while the positive PPO and recent relative divergence indicate ongoing bullish momentum, albeit weak in the case of PPO.  The lack of earnings data and other financial figures makes it difficult to definitively assess the sustainability of this outperformance.  Further research is needed to analyze financial performance and incorporate current news and analyst opinions before making any investment decisions.  The provided expected return of 0.13% is too low to be used alone in investment decision-making.
