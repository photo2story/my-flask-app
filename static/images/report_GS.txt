Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The provided data shows GS significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over a given period.  Further analysis is required to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison and Divergence:**

* **GS Cumulative Return:** 120.66%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** 31.2% (GS outperformed VOO by 31.2 percentage points at the end of the measured period)
* **Relative Divergence:** 70.9% (This indicates GS's performance relative to the S&P 500 is in the upper 70th percentile of its historical range.  It does *not* imply a 70.9% probability of continued outperformance.)

The historical Alpha and Beta values show mixed results.

* **Closing Price:** 548.45
* **Last Market Price:** 559.82 (a 2.07 increase from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 554.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 555.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 599.40

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend, although the recent price increase indicates short-term volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.30 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.1897 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though relatively low)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -13.2% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 4.4% (This is the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term investmentâ€”2+ years).


The recent price increase of 2.07 suggests a potential short-term upward correction or a temporary bounce.  However, the price being below the moving averages and the negative relative divergence suggest caution. The low to medium MRI suggests relatively lower risk compared to other time periods.  The positive but low PPO indicates some bullish momentum, but it is not overwhelmingly strong.  The expected return of 4.4% over the S&P 500 is a significant factor for long-term investors. However,  it's crucial to remember that this is just an *expected* return and does not guarantee future performance.  More in-depth analysis, including fundamental analysis, is needed before making any investment decisions.
