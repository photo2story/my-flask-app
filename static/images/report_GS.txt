## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Investment Review

This report analyzes Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Goldman Sachs significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for GS is 189.99%, while the S&P 500's is 130.06%. This represents a difference of 59.93 percentage points. The relative divergence indicator of 100.0 indicates that the current outperformance is at the highest level observed within the historical dataset.  However, it's crucial to understand that this doesn't guarantee future outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show varying performance relative to the market (likely the S&P 500).  While the alpha generally hovers around 0.1, indicating slight outperformance, the beta fluctuates significantly, showing periods of high sensitivity (over 80) and less sensitivity (around 50) to market movements.  This suggests GS's performance is not consistently correlated with the overall market. The consistently positive alpha across several years, however, does hint at a persistent value-creation ability independent of market conditions.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 44.0% | 5.9% | 13.0% | 80.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 0.0% | 13.7% | -20.0% | 0.1 | 52.0 |
| 2017-2019  | -8.0% | 13.7% | -41.0% | 0.1 | 72.0 |
| 2018-2020  | -2.0% | 21.9% | -31.0% | 0.1 | 83.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 92.0% | 21.9% | 17.0% | 0.1 | 120.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 46.0% | 21.9% | 36.0% | 0.1 | 108.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 46.0% | 11.4% | 20.0% | 0.1 | 121.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 111.0% | 11.4% | 69.0% | 0.1 | 190.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 608.57
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 605.06
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 583.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 529.27

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish trend.  The last market price of 612.18 shows a slight increase from the closing price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 62.96 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.087 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (Missing data).
* **Expected Return:** 3.5% (This is a long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500.)

The conflicting signals from RSI and PPO require further investigation.  The missing divergence data prevents a complete assessment of potential trend reversals. The 3.5% expected return is considered optimistic, but requires a detailed forecast based on broader macroeconomic factors and not just past performance. The 612.18 last market price is only slightly higher than the closing price (608.57) therefore, no sudden surge is implied.

**4. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available, preventing a thorough financial analysis.  This is a critical gap in the provided data.


**5. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires current news data on Goldman Sachs' earnings announcements (within the last 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to complete the analysis.  Without access to real-time information, I cannot provide this section.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a robust cumulative return significantly higher than the benchmark. However, the volatility in its beta indicates a sensitivity to broader market swings, while the generally positive alpha suggests some underlying strength.  Recent price action shows strength, but the conflicting technical indicators and lack of financial information require more data for a conclusive assessment.  The absence of recent news and earnings data critically limits the depth of this analysis.  Before any investment decision, a comprehensive review of financial statements, current news, and a thorough risk assessment are crucial. The expected return, though positive relative to the benchmark, is heavily reliant on the current economic climate and is not guaranteed.  The missing data makes it challenging to provide a complete and reliable investment recommendation.
