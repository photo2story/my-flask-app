## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Investment Review

This report analyzes Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

GS's cumulative return (169.897%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.682%). The difference is 49.2%, placing it at the 88.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates GS has historically outperformed the broader market, though past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $581.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $570.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $586.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $556.21

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term downward pressure, but above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 42.45 – Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.49 – Shows a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +7.7 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.8% –  This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  This is a low expected return, and should be considered in the context of the overall risk profile.  The low return may reflect the market's current assessment of GS's future prospects.


**4. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided, preventing a full fundamental analysis.  Further financial data is required for a comprehensive evaluation.

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), current market outlook for GS, and analyst opinions. Without this information, a complete assessment of recent events influencing GS's price cannot be made.  News sources such as financial news websites and company press releases would be helpful here.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent indicators show mixed signals. While the long-term performance is positive, current technical indicators suggest some short-term bearishness (PPO negative, price below 20-day moving average). The low expected return further suggests caution. The lack of fundamental financial data significantly limits the analysis.  A more thorough analysis requires access to more comprehensive financial data, recent news, and analyst reports to determine a fair value and assess the risk/reward ratio of investing in GS.  The historical outperformance should be viewed with caution; it is not necessarily indicative of future performance.  The low expected return suggests that the market may already be pricing in much of the positive outlook for the company. Before making an investment decision, a thorough evaluation considering all available information is necessary.
