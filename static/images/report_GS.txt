**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Cumulative Return (GS):** 187.68%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 117.28%
* **Return Difference (GS - VOO):** 70.4%
* **Relative Divergence:** 87.8% (Indicates GS significantly outperformed VOO historically, relative to its historical range of outperformance)


**1. Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.

The provided data shows that GS significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of 187.68% compared to VOO's 117.28%.  The 70.4% difference reflects substantial outperformance.  However, the relative divergence of 87.8% emphasizes that this level of outperformance is high relative to the historical range of performance differences between GS and VOO.


The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) data illustrate fluctuating performance across different time periods.  While some periods show high CAGR (e.g., 90% in 2019-2021), others reveal negative returns and significant drawdowns. The alpha values show periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (Beta).  The changing market capitalization (Cap(B)) highlights the company's growth and fluctuations in valuation over time.  Further investigation into the macroeconomic factors influencing each period's performance would be valuable.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $626.14
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $646.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $645.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $608.99

The stock price is currently below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support from a longer-term perspective.  The small positive change from the previous close (+$0.0863) is not significant enough to suggest a sharp reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.14 (Near the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -0.765 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -11.2% (Suggests a recent weakening in relative performance compared to the market.)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 0.9% (This represents the expected annualized excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2 years or more).  This is a very low expected return suggesting that the high historical outperformance of GS is not necessarily expected to continue.)


**Conclusion:**

GS has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent indicators suggest a weakening short-term trend and a modest expected long-term outperformance.  The high historical relative divergence suggests that replicating past performance is unlikely. A thorough fundamental analysis, considering current market conditions and the company's future prospects, is crucial for informed investment decisions. The provided data alone is insufficient to recommend a specific investment strategy.
