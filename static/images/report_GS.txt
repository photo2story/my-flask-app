**Executive Summary:** Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  This report analyzes its recent performance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), using provided financial metrics.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs (GS) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the provided period.  The cumulative return for GS is 208.83%, while VOO's is 122.48%.  This results in a difference of 86.4%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 (based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence of -45.1% and 86.4% respectively).

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results across different periods. While some periods exhibit strong positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, Beta > 1), others show negative alpha, suggesting underperformance.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in recent periods (e.g., 90%, 132%) signifies strong growth, but this needs to be considered in the context of the significant market volatility reflected in the maximum drawdown (MDD) figures. The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** 672.19

* **20-Day Moving Average:** 644.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 605.47

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 70.48 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.029 (Slightly positive, indicating a bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.2% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.6% (This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term investment).

The RSI being close to 70 suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term, potentially leading to a correction. However, the positive PPO and short-term upward trend indicate continued bullish momentum. The low expected return of 0.6% suggests that while GS has historically outperformed, future outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is not expected to be dramatic over the long term.  This may reflect a return to more normalized performance expectations after a period of significant outperformance.  Further investigation into the underlying factors driving recent high returns is needed to assess the long-term sustainability of the performance.
