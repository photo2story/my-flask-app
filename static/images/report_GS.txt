## Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Stock Review

This report analyzes Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Goldman Sachs has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered.  The cumulative return for GS is 170.62%, while the VOO's cumulative return is 120.69%. This results in a difference of 49.9%, placing its relative divergence at the 89.2nd percentile based on historical data.  While this indicates strong past performance relative to the S&P 500, past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance relative to the market over different time periods. While some periods show significant outperformance (e.g., 2019-2021), others show underperformance or even negative returns. Alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting modest outperformance compared to the market benchmark (beta), though this needs to be considered in context with the inherent risk (Beta) and risk-adjusted return calculations.  It is noteworthy that market capitalization (Cap(B)) has increased significantly over the analyzed period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $582.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $564.78
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $587.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $554.65

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a potential short-term pullback after a recent upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 42.31 – This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.69 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +3.8 – Indicates a short-term upward trend in the relative performance against the benchmark.

The provided expected return of 8.1% over a long-term (2+ years) horizon, relative to the S&P 500, is optimistic considering the volatility observed in the CAGR data.  The closing price of $582.79 does not indicate an extreme event (no evidence of a sudden dramatic jump or drop) based solely on the data provided.

**4. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data makes a comprehensive financial analysis impossible.  Further financial data is needed for a thorough assessment.

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Earnings News (Last 2 days):** This information is missing from the provided data.  Access to recent earnings reports and press releases is crucial for a complete analysis.
* **Market Outlook:**  The overall market outlook impacts GS.  Information about current economic conditions, interest rate expectations, and investor sentiment is needed for context.
* **Analyst Opinions:** This data is also missing.  Accessing analyst ratings, price targets, and commentaries provides additional perspectives on GS's future prospects.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but this has been volatile.  Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) present a mixed signal, suggesting caution.  The absence of crucial financial and news data limits the analysis.  The expected return of 8.1% over the long term is positive but should be considered with caution due to inherent market risk and the lack of comprehensive supporting data.  Further investigation into recent earnings, market outlook, and analyst opinions is essential before forming any investment conclusions. The high relative divergence needs to be interpreted carefully, considering the volatility inherent in financial markets.  This historical relative outperformance might not persist in the future.
