This report analyzes Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm.  The analysis incorporates provided data points to offer a comprehensive perspective on the stock's performance and potential.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Goldman Sachs has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return of GS is 171.66%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 120.40%.  This results in a difference of 51.3%, placing it at the 90.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided max/min range.  The provided Alpha values consistently suggest above-market performance, though the Beta values indicate considerable market sensitivity.  While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, this historical outperformance is noteworthy.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last market close (585.23), GS shows a slight downward trend in the short term:

* **Closing Price:** 585.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 594.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 594.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 540.82

The price is below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent downward pressure.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price is negligible.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (56.01):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral momentum.
* **PPO (-0.72):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum, although the magnitude is relatively small.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-7.1):** Shows a recent short-term relative underperformance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (7.4%):**  Suggests an above-market return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500.  This is contingent on the continuation of historical trends.

The absence of significant price changes since the last market close negates the need to comment on a rapid price movement (either upward or downward).


**4. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no crucial financial data (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) is available for analysis.  This significantly limits the depth of the financial assessment.  Further data acquisition is recommended.

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Analyst Opinions and Performance Highlights:**  Offers a diverse perspective on future expectations for GS.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs (GS) has historically outperformed the S&P 500, as evidenced by a significantly higher cumulative return. However, recent price action suggests some short-term weakness. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with the RSI suggesting neutrality and the PPO showing a slightly bearish trend. The absence of key financial data and recent news limits the comprehensiveness of this analysis. The projected long-term expected return is positive compared to the S&P 500, however, this is subject to market conditions and relies on the continuation of past trends. More data is crucial for a more definitive conclusion.  Further research focusing on filling the data gaps identified above (especially recent news and financial statements) is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
