## Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS), a global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm, based on the provided data.  Due to limited financial data available, certain aspects of the analysis are constrained.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Goldman Sachs has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for GS is 180.19%, while the S&P 500's is 124.78%, resulting in a difference of 55.41%. This places the relative divergence at the 96.68th percentile of historical data, indicating a strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  The historical data shows periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 587.99 (Last-market: 588.06)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 591.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 552.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 516.07

The price is currently above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, it's slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating some recent price correction.  The relatively close proximity of the price to the 5-day MA suggests the recent price movement is not a significant divergence.

**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

* **RSI:** 69.65 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.53 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 8.96 (+) (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.11% (Long-term expected outperformance relative to S&P 500)

The RSI nearing 70 suggests the stock might be slightly overbought in the short term.  However, a positive PPO and a positive relative divergence indicate continued upward momentum.  The 0.11% expected return represents a modest long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming a similar trend continues.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

No earnings data is available to provide a detailed analysis of recent performance and outlook. This significantly limits the ability to accurately assess the company's financial health and future prospects.  Further research is crucial for obtaining up-to-date earnings information and analyst forecasts.

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available, preventing a comprehensive financial analysis.  Access to these crucial metrics would allow for a deeper understanding of the company's financial performance and profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

Without access to real-time news sources and financial databases (like Shacknews or Finbold), I cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of recent news, market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights.  This section requires external information retrieval.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Goldman Sachs has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong long-term trend.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term price correction, but overall momentum remains positive.  However, the lack of financial data significantly hinders a complete assessment.  Further research on recent earnings, financial statements, and market news is crucial for a thorough evaluation of GS's investment potential.  The high relative divergence suggests that GS may be highly correlated with market performance but has historically outperformed during the observation periods.
