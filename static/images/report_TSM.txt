The current valuation, however, should be carefully considered in light of the recent relative underperformance and market sentiment.  Further analysis of news and analyst opinions (from section 7) would be crucial for a complete investment decision.  The RSI suggests a potential bounce, but the negative PPO and below-average price suggest caution. The long-term outlook, given the expected excess returns, remains positive but depends on future market conditions and the resolution of any short-term concerns highlighted by the provided data.
