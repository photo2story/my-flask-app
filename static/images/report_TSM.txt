## Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd ADR (TSM) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSM) is the world's largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry.  Over the period analyzed, TSM's cumulative return (429.14%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (125.6%). The difference is 303.54%, placing it at the 86.08th percentile of the historical range of divergence between TSM and the S&P 500. This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided alpha values consistently above 1 suggest TSM has generated excess returns compared to the market benchmark. Beta values are generally close to 1, indicating a similar level of volatility to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $189.67 (Last Market: $189.72)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $187.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $193.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $183.04

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend, but above the 5-day and 60-day averages, indicating longer-term support.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (44.65):**  Suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (-0.83):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence (-8.17):** Shows a recent weakening in relative strength, consistent with the price action.
* **Expected Return (1.69%):**  This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  The provided figure needs further clarification on its calculation methodology.  A 1.69% *annual* return is low, especially given the past performance; this figure needs more context (e.g., is it an average annual return, a specific projection based on current models, etc.?)  A higher value would be expected given the historical alpha values.  The interpretation of 189.72 being "large" impacting the analysis requires further definition regarding what constitutes "large" in this context, particularly if it signifies a sudden jump in price.


**4. Recent Earnings & Outlook:**

TSM has consistently exceeded earnings per share (EPS) expectations in recent quarters.  The most recent quarter (2024-10-17) shows EPS of 1.94, surpassing the expected 1.8. This positive trend supports the relatively high historical returns.  However, to fully assess the outlook, a deeper dive into the companyâ€™s guidance and the broader semiconductor market conditions is needed.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Shows strong and relatively consistent revenue growth, with high profit margins.  Seasonality might be a factor, as revenue and profit margin fluctuate slightly throughout the year.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has grown steadily, although ROE shows some fluctuation. The overall picture suggests a healthy financial position.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**  (This section requires accessing real-time news sources.  Please provide dates for specific news items to analyze.)

To provide a thorough analysis, recent news, including earnings calls, analyst ratings, and any significant market events impacting the semiconductor industry, should be reviewed from reputable sources such as the company's investor relations website, financial news outlets (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance), and analyst reports.  FINBOLD, for example, often aggregates news and opinions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TSM has demonstrated strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500. Recent financial results are positive, exceeding expectations. However, short-term price action shows some weakness, as indicated by the moving averages and the PPO. The RSI suggests the stock might be approaching oversold conditions, potentially setting up a bounce. The expected return, however, requires further clarification and likely needs adjustment based on a more complete market analysis.  Further scrutiny is needed concerning the interpretation of the reported Expected Return (1.69%). The impact of current geopolitical and macroeconomic factors on the semiconductor industry should also be carefully considered.


**8. Recommendations:**

A thorough fundamental and technical analysis, incorporating current market conditions and future projections, is crucial before making any investment decision. The analysis thus far points to a historically strong performer with healthy financials, but short-term trends are less positive. A long-term investment might be considered if the long-term outlook for the semiconductor industry remains positive and the expected return figure is confirmed by robust external analysis. Risk tolerance should be carefully considered given the inherent volatility in the semiconductor sector.  A consultation with a financial advisor is always recommended before investing.
