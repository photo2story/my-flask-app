## Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd ADR (TSM) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSM) is a leading semiconductor manufacturer.  Over the period analyzed, TSM's cumulative return (423.03%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (124.78%). The difference is 298.25%, placing it at the 84.64th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This suggests TSM has historically shown strong outperformance.  The provided Alpha values consistently above 1 also support this conclusion, indicating above-market returns. However, the recent 2021-2023 period shows a negative return for TSM, highlighting the volatility of the semiconductor sector.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $187.48 (Last Market: $189.90)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $188.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $194.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $182.68

The price is currently below its 20-day and 5-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential longer-term support.  The recent drop from $189.90 to $187.48 could be a minor correction within a larger trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Strength:**

* **RSI (39.55):** This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound.
* **PPO (-0.96):** A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (-12.23):** This shows a recent decrease in relative strength against the market.

The combination of oversold RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the negative relative divergence, indicates conflicting signals. While RSI suggests a potential rebound, the other indicators point to continuing bearish pressure.  The $189.90 price is not significantly higher to indicate a rapid rebound.

**6. News & Recent Issues:** (This section requires accessing real-time news sources.  I cannot provide specific news from the last 48 hours without access to live feeds like Shacknews or Finbold.)  A search for recent TSM news on these platforms should provide insights into recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

TSM has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations. However, current technical indicators paint a mixed picture, with conflicting signals suggesting potential for both upward and downward movements.  The relatively high expected return (1.69%) and the strong historical performance suggest long-term potential, but the short-term outlook remains uncertain due to the bearish technical signals.  Analysis of recent news and analyst opinions will refine this short-term outlook.


**8.  Report Summary:**

TSM shows a strong long-term growth history, exceeding the S&P 500 significantly.  Recent earnings beats are positive, but short-term technical indicators are mixed, suggesting caution.  Further research into recent news and analyst sentiment is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The relatively high expected return (1.69%) over the long term (2+ years), in conjunction with the long-term outperformance, makes it a potentially attractive investment for a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy. However, short-term volatility should be expected.
