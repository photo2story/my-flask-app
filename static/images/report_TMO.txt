## Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) is a leading provider of scientific instruments, reagents, and consumables.  Over the period analyzed, TMO's cumulative return (118.12%) lagged behind the S&P 500's return (123.86%) by 5.74 percentage points.  While this shows underperformance compared to the broader market, the relative underperformance is only at the 1.47 percentile considering historical volatility (max 142.72%, min -7.95%).  The provided data does not offer a time frame for the cumulative returns, which is crucial for proper context.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 50.0%  | 13.3%  | 1.1   | 72.6  |
| 2016-2018  | 63.0%  | 17.1%  | 1.1   | 85.6  |
| 2017-2019  | 128.2% | 17.1%  | 1.1   | 124.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 143.3% | 24.2%  | 0.8   | 178.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 206.2% | 24.2%  | 0.8   | 255.2 |
| 2020-2022  | 69.8%  | 24.2%  | 0.8   | 210.6 |

| 2022-2024  | -19.9% | 27.5%  | 0.9   | 203.9 |

The table shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in most periods, indicating strong historical performance. However,  the Alpha, measuring excess return over the market, is mixed, showing periods of both outperformance (Alpha > 1) and underperformance (Alpha < 1).  Beta, measuring market sensitivity, is consistently above 1, suggesting higher volatility than the market.  The significant drop in CAGR from 2021-2024 highlights the impact of recent market conditions.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $513.08 (Last Market: $513.15)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $535.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $554.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $590.25

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 25.73 - This suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.44 - A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** -25.39 - This confirms a short-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided 0% expected return is likely a short-term projection.  Long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 requires further analysis and consideration of various market factors. A 0% expected return means the model doesn't see significant outperformance of the S&P 500.  The fact that the price is close to the last market price suggests no significant price jump (neither a surge nor a crash) after the data was collected.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-11-01 | 4.26  | $10.60 B     |
| 2024-08-02 | 4.05  | $10.54 B     |
| 2024-05-03 | 3.47  | $10.35 B     |
| 2023-11-03 | 4.44  | $10.57 B     |
| 2024-11-01 | 4.44  | $10.57 B     |

There's a duplication in the data for November 2024.  Revenue remains relatively consistent, while EPS shows some fluctuation.  Further analysis is needed to compare these figures against expectations and previous quarters.  The lack of analyst consensus estimates prevents a comprehensive assessment of the most recent results.

**6. Financial Information:**

**1) Revenue and Profitability:**

The revenue is relatively stable, while profit margins fluctuate slightly around 40%.  This shows a consistent and healthy profit margin, indicating a sound business model.

**2) Capital and Profitability:**

Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) show some fluctuation.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying reasons for these changes and compare them to industry benchmarks.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Information Missing:**  The prompt requires information about recent news (within the last two days), analyst opinions, and market outlook, but this data is not provided.  To complete this section, news sources such as Finbold, Seeking Alpha, and company press releases should be consulted.  This would include any earnings announcements or analyst upgrades/downgrades.

**8. Summary:**

TMO has shown strong historical growth but has recently underperformed the S&P 500.  While technical indicators suggest the stock might be oversold, the negative PPO and relative divergence point to bearish momentum.  Recent financial performance shows stable revenue and a consistent profit margin.  However, a more complete analysis requires access to recent news, analyst forecasts, and comparison to expectations for a full evaluation. The lack of specific timeframes for the cumulative return calculations and a missing earnings surprise analysis hinder a conclusive assessment.  Further research, particularly into recent news and analyst opinions, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
