Higher alpha values in earlier years suggest better performance than the market in the past.

**4. Recent Financials & Outlook:**

The provided EPS and Revenue data show some fluctuations but generally indicate a strong financial performance.  However, to fully assess the recent performance, you need to compare the reported numbers with analyst expectations for each quarter to understand whether the results beat or missed those targets.  Without the expected values, it is hard to properly evaluate recent performance.

|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-11-01 | 4.26  | $10.60 B    |

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The quarterly data reveals relatively stable revenue around $10.5B-$10.8B, with consistent profit margins hovering around 40%.  Return on Equity (ROE) shows some fluctuation, implying the profitability of using shareholder equity is not consistently high. Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying causes of these variations and assess long-term trends.

**8. Overall Summary:**

TMO currently shows signs of underperformance relative to the S&P 500, reflected in its negative relative divergence.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition and bearish momentum. While financials indicate relatively stable revenue and profit margins, the lack of comparison to analyst expectations and the recent price decline warrant caution.  Further research is required to assess the long-term growth prospects and evaluate whether the current price presents a buying opportunity.  Analyzing recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.
