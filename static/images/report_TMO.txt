Additional information, especially concerning the duplicated data points from November 1st, 2024, is required for more precise conclusions.

* Verifying the accuracy of the provided data, particularly the duplicated earnings data entry.
* Consulting recent financial news and analyst reports to understand recent market sentiment and predictions.
