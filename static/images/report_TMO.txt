The absence of any earnings forecast for the next period makes it challenging to make a reliable prediction.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  The company demonstrates consistent high revenue figures, but profit margins exhibit minor fluctuation around 40%. This suggests a relatively stable and profitable business model, however, the recent slight downturn requires further investigation.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires current news sources such as Shacknews, FINBOLD etc.  to be provided.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

TMO currently shows signs of underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While the oversold RSI suggests a potential bounce, the negative PPO and below-average moving average prices point towards a bearish short-term trend.  The recent slight decrease in profit margins and ROE also raises some concerns, demanding further analysis of the financial statements and market news.  The lack of a positive expected return further dampens near-term outlook.  A longer-term investment strategy might be considered only after thorough fundamental analysis, including examination of recent news and analyst forecasts.
