This report analyzes Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) based on the provided data, encompassing performance, valuation, financial health, and recent news.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is a provider of scientific instrumentation, reagents, and consumables.  Over the period analyzed, TMO's cumulative return (113.12%) lagged behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (124.78%) by 11.66 percentage points. This places it at the lower end of the historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500, as indicated by the relative divergence of 0.0.  The provided alpha values (ranging from 0.8 to 1.1) suggest that TMO has sometimes outperformed the market (positive alpha), and sometimes underperformed (negative alpha). The beta values, consistently around 1, indicate that TMO's price movements are relatively closely correlated with the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $501.29 (Last-market: $501.49)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $526.01
* **20-day Moving Average:** $549.52
* **60-day Moving Average:** $588.51

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 23.69 -  This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is due.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.7 - A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -25.29 -  This shows a significant recent relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% - This suggests no significant expected outperformance over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  Given the current market conditions and the company's recent performance, this projection warrants caution.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some fluctuation.  While revenue consistently remains above $10 billion, EPS shows some variance.  A comparison to analyst estimates (not provided) would be crucial to assess the performance against expectations. The most recent EPS of 4.26 is lower than the previous quarter's 4.44.  Further analysis of the financial statements is necessary to provide a more complete picture.


**5.  Financial Information Analysis:**

The revenue and profitability data indicate relatively stable revenue but some fluctuations in profit margins.  ROE (Return on Equity) also fluctuates, suggesting changes in the efficiency of capital utilization.  A deeper dive into the underlying reasons for these changes is needed.


**6.  News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires additional information.  Please provide links to recent news articles or financial reports to accurately assess recent market outlooks, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.)*  I need access to real-time news sources to fulfill this section.


**7.  Comprehensive Analysis:**

TMO is currently trading below its moving averages and shows technical indicators suggesting potential for a rebound from oversold conditions (RSI). However, its recent relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and a flat expected return raise concerns. The company's financial performance shows stable revenue but fluctuating profitability, necessitating a more detailed analysis of underlying factors.  Further, detailed news and analyst reports are necessary for a complete picture.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data provided, TMO presents a mixed outlook. The oversold condition (RSI) may present a buying opportunity for some investors with a higher risk tolerance, particularly if recent negative news is deemed transient. However, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, flat expected return, and fluctuating profitability should be carefully considered.  Further investigation into the reasons behind recent underperformance and a comparison to analyst expectations is essential before making any investment decision.  Additional data (especially news articles and analyst opinions) will greatly enhance the accuracy and detail of this analysis.
