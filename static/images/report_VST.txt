This report analyzes Vistra Corp (VST), an energy company.

**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Vistra Corp (VST) has shown significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.

* **VST Cumulative Return:** 512.09%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 102.68%
* **Return Difference:** 409.4%

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows extremely high growth in the last two years (2022-2024 and 2023-2025),  significantly exceeding market performance reflected in the high Alpha values.  However, prior years show considerable volatility and even negative returns in some periods, highlighting significant risk.  The high Beta values consistently indicate a high sensitivity to market movements.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2016-2018  | 33.0% | 6.5% | 24.0% | 0.1 | 6.7 |
| 2017-2019  | -1.0% | 11.7% | -31.0% | 0.1 | 6.8 |
| 2018-2020  | -18.0% | 14.3% | -45.0% | -0.1 | 6.0 |
| 2019-2021  | -13.0% | 14.3% | -84.0% | -0.2 | 7.2 |
| 2020-2022  | 10.0% | 14.3% | 2.0% | -0.2 | 7.6 |
| 2021-2023  | 101.0% | 13.7% | 1.0 | 12.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 562.0% | 13.7% | 1.2 | 46.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 486.0% | 20.4% | 1.2 | 43.0 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 126.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 132.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 155.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 156.30

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase (2.41) needs further investigation to understand the drivers.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 25.17 (Suggests the stock is oversold)
* **PPO:** -2.89 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.4% (Indicates a recent short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 15.5% (This is an *additional* return above the S&P 500,  implying significant outperformance is expected, but this needs careful consideration given the high volatility previously shown)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the negative recent relative divergence, suggest bearish sentiment. However, the significant price increase needs consideration.  Is this a temporary bounce or a potential trend reversal?  More detailed analysis is needed.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-11-08 | 5.36  | $4.34 B      |
| 2024-08-09 | 0.92  | $3.60 B      |
| 2024-05-10 | -0.24 | $3.16 B      |
| 2023-11-07 | 1.27  | $4.79 B      |
| 2024-11-08 | 1.27  | $4.79 B      |

There seems to be an error in the data.  The 2024-11-08 entry is duplicated.  Ignoring the duplicate, there's significant volatility in EPS and revenue,  with a surprisingly high EPS in the most recent quarter (Nov 2024).  Further investigation into these fluctuations is critical.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $4.04B | 39.63% |
| 2024-09-30 | $6.29B | 55.10% |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.85B | 42.13% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.05B | 27.50% |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.08B | 27.62% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $5.57B | 7.92% |
| 2024-09-30 | $5.44B | 34.70% |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.59B | 6.53% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.66B | -0.62% |
| 2023-12-31 | $5.31B | -3.47% |

Both revenue and profitability show significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  ROE also exhibits volatility. This underlines the risk associated with VST.  The high profit margins in some quarters are noteworthy, but the inconsistency needs careful analysis.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) exhibits exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by substantial volatility and risk.  The high Beta underscores its sensitivity to market swings. Recent price action shows a potential downward trend, despite a recent price jump.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions and bearish momentum, but this needs to be considered in light of the recent earnings surge and the possibility of a trend reversal.  The inconsistencies in earnings and financial data necessitate thorough fundamental analysis to understand the underlying drivers of performance and the sustainability of future growth.  A long-term investment requires careful consideration of the inherent risk involved.  Further research, including a thorough review of company-specific news and industry trends, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The predicted 15.5% outperformance needs careful scrutiny given past volatility.
