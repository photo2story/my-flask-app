*   **Analysis:** Revenue and profit margins have fluctuated but remain relatively high.  ROE also varies.  The negative ROE in 2025-03-31 suggests a loss during that quarter. The relatively large ROE on 2024-09-30 is worth further investigation.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Vistra Corp. has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative return. Recent performance, however, shows a slight decline relative to the index. The company exhibits high volatility (high MDD). While the MRI suggests a "medium investment" rating and analyst consensus is positive, the recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, trading below key moving averages. Earnings are not consistently growing. The recent upgrade to investment grade is a positive development.

**Overall, Vistra presents a mixed picture. It's a high-growth, high-volatility stock with strong long-term potential, but short-term risks.** A more in-depth review of the energy sector, Vistra's specific business strategy, and competitive landscape, is needed before making an investment decision. Also, a deeper look at the source data is needed to determine the trends in revenues and EPS.
