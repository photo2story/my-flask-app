This report analyzes Vistra Corp (VST), an independent power producer and energy storage company, based on the provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

VST's cumulative return (723.93%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (113.60%).  The difference is 610.3 percentage points, placing it at the 85.9th percentile of the historical maximum to minimum return difference range (max: 724.4, min: -84.1).  This indicates a substantially higher return compared to the benchmark index over the considered period.

Alpha and Beta analysis reveals high volatility and significant swings in performance. While recent years (2022-2025) show extremely high CAGR, earlier periods exhibit negative or low returns.  The high Beta values (generally above 6) suggest high sensitivity to market movements.  However, the positive alpha values in recent years suggest that VST has outperformed the market significantly during those periods.  It's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) demonstrates exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500 in recent years, but this comes with substantial volatility and risk. The high beta indicates significant sensitivity to market swings. While recent earnings show promising numbers, previous periods highlight considerable inconsistency.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture.  The high projected excess return over the long term is enticing, but investors should be fully aware of the high risk associated with this stock due to its volatility.  Further investigation into the drivers of the earnings volatility and a comprehensive risk assessment are crucial before making any investment decision.  Past performance, as demonstrated, is not indicative of future results.
