## Vistra Corp (VST) Stock Report

This report analyzes Vistra Corp (VST), an independent power producer and energy storage provider, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

VST's cumulative return of 263.96% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 62.50%.  The difference is 201.5%, placing it at the 59.9th percentile of the historical range (-71.5% to 384.0%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and inconsistent performance.  While recent years (2021-2025) show exceptionally high CAGR and Alpha, reflecting strong outperformance, earlier periods demonstrate significant negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The high Beta consistently indicates significant market sensitivity.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) from 6.7B to 46.8B in just a few years highlights this rapid growth period.  This volatile performance makes it crucial to consider risk tolerance before investing.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $129.63
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $127.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $115.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $131.18

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term pullback from a higher price level.  The significant gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages highlights the recent price surge.  The small daily change of $0.23 doesn't indicate a significant sudden price movement (neither a sharp upturn or downturn).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 61.99 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 2.44 (Positive; suggests bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 9.6% (above S&P 500)

The technical indicators suggest a moderately bullish outlook, although the MRI indicates a medium risk level. The positive PPO and rising relative divergence support this.  The high expected return indicates potential for significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant variability. While Q4 2024 shows strong EPS and revenue,  Q1 2024 shows a loss.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

VST exhibits high growth potential and has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in recent years. However, its performance is highly volatile, with periods of substantial losses and high market sensitivity.  The recent positive price movement and bullish technical indicators suggest a potential short-term upward trend.  However, the inconsistent earnings and financial data require a deeper dive to understand the underlying drivers.  Long-term investors with high risk tolerance might consider VST, given the potential for high returns, but thorough due diligence and risk management are essential.  The high volatility warrants careful monitoring and a well-defined risk management strategy.
