**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $119.31
* **Last Market Price:** $116.59
* **5-day Moving Average:** $128.13
* **20-day Moving Average:** $123.88
* **60-day Moving Average:** $149.86

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop of $2.07 reflects this downward pressure.

* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.4% (Short-term bearish trend)

The recent price drop (-$2.07) should be considered within the context of the overall market trends and company-specific news.

The Medium Risk MRI warrants caution.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

VST has demonstrated exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500,  but this performance is highly volatile and characterized by periods of substantial gains and losses. The recent price decline and negative short-term divergence indicators suggest caution.  While the long-term expected return is positive, the high risk, as indicated by the variable Beta,  the large fluctuations in earnings and ROE, and the significant price volatility, should be carefully considered. Further investigation is needed to clarify data inconsistencies and understand the underlying drivers of the company's performance.  A thorough due diligence process is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The extremely high CAGR values in the last two years must be investigated thoroughly.  They may indicate unsustainable growth.
