* **VST Cumulative Return:** 382.53%

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) exhibits a strong historical track record of outperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years. However, this outperformance comes with significantly higher volatility and risk, as evidenced by high beta values and substantial maximum drawdowns.  While the recent price increase and positive technical indicators are encouraging, the high volatility, mixed financial data (earnings and profitability), and the need for clarification on data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) necessitate a cautious approach.  Further investigation into the drivers of the company's volatility and recent earnings surge is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The projected 20.1% long-term expected return is enticing, but the inherent risks must be carefully considered.
