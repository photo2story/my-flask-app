**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $111.71
* **5-day Moving Average:** $108.77
* **20-day Moving Average:** $119.43
* **60-day Moving Average:** $141.40

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend or at least a short-term correction.  The recent price increase of $2.24 (2.05%) from the previous close indicates a short-term upward bounce.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.88 (approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.089 (negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** 2.7% (positive, short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 5.6% (above S&P 500)

The combination of a high MRI, low RSI, negative PPO, and recent price increase suggests a volatile market situation with high risk. However, the positive short-term momentum and positive long-term expected return could present an opportunity for long-term investors.  The price increase from the previous close (2.05%) indicates a recent price bounce, but caution should be taken.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While some quarters show strong EPS and revenue growth (e.g., 2024-09-30 and 2024-11-08), others show losses or substantially lower earnings. This reinforces the observation from alpha and beta analysis about the volatility and market sensitivity of the company.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) has demonstrated exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, but this performance has been highly volatile.  High beta values indicate significant market risk. While the long-term expected return is positive, the high risk profile, as evidenced by the MRI, inconsistent earnings, and fluctuating financial metrics, requires careful consideration.  Investors should be comfortable with high volatility and should conduct thorough due diligence before investing in VST.  The recent price bounce might be a temporary upward trend within a broader volatile picture.  Long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance might find the potential for outperformance attractive, but this should be balanced against the significant risk involved.
