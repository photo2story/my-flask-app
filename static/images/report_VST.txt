**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Vistra Corp. (VST) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 recently, however the short-term indicates a weakening of performance. The company exhibits high volatility (high MDD), but also has displayed a very high growth in recent period. Analyst consensus is strongly bullish, supported by recent news of an S&P upgrade.  However, the recent price action (below moving averages) and the slight decrease in relative divergence suggest some short-term caution is warranted. The substantial expected return, if accurate, makes it a potentially attractive investment. Overall, VST appears to be a higher-risk, high-reward stock with good growth potential.  Investors should be aware of the volatility and do further research before investing.
