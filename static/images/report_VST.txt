**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Vistra Corp is an energy company.  VST's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by 171.16%.  While its relative divergence of 53.3% suggests strong historical outperformance, it's crucial to remember this is relative to past performance and doesn't guarantee future returns.  The alpha and beta analysis reveals significant volatility and inconsistent performance across different periods.  High beta values indicate significant market sensitivity.  Noteworthy is the extremely high CAGR in 2022-2024, indicating a period of exceptionally strong performance, which might not be sustainable.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $115.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $113.06
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $117.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $138.32

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The recent small increase of $0.12  is not significant enough to indicate a major trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 47.77 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.89 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (Short-term upward trend)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO suggests upward momentum, the RSI and the price being below its moving averages hint at a potential bearish trend. The MRI suggests a medium level of risk.  The small positive price change doesn't signal a significant event.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

VST has demonstrated significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance is highly volatile, and the recent price action suggests a potential bearish trend.  The exceptionally high earnings and profit margins in Q3 2024 require further investigation to determine sustainability.  Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence, including analyzing the reasons behind the volatile performance and the unusually high figures in Q3 2024. The high beta indicates significant market risk.  While a long-term investment might offer a potential 9.5% higher return than the S&P 500, this projection is contingent upon the company sustaining its performance and overcoming the evident volatility.  The data suggests a need for caution and thorough fundamental analysis before investing.
