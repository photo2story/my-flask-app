**Analysis:** Revenue has fluctuated, with a notable peak in Q3 2024. Profit margins have also varied, but generally remain strong. Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile, with one negative quarter.  These variances can be caused by a number of real world factors, but it's important to try and understand how the company is dealing with volatility of this sort, and what is the most common cause of it.

### 7. Summary

Vistra Corp (VST) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, driven by strong recent growth and positive alpha. Analyst consensus is positive, and the MRI suggests a relatively safe investment. However, the high MDD indicates significant volatility. The recent price action and PPO suggest a minor bearish signal in the short term, but the expected return remains attractive for long-term investors. The news is mixed, with positive catalysts offset by insider selling. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing.
