**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for VST is 549.76%, while VOO's is 109.86%. This results in a difference of 439.9 percentage points.

The high Beta values (mostly above 5) indicate significant sensitivity to market movements.  The alpha, representing excess return relative to the market, fluctuates considerably, highlighting the risk-reward profile of VST.

* **20-day Moving Average:** $159.70

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.  While the stock has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 over the longer term, exhibiting extremely high CAGR,  the data reveals substantial volatility, both in price and earnings.  The recent price drop and negative technical indicators suggest caution.  The extremely high CAGR and Alpha in the last 2 years need to be examined in context with the preceding periods' poor performance.  Further due diligence is essential, including investigating the reasons behind the volatile earnings and the exceptionally high Q3 2024 figures, before making any investment decisions. The high beta emphasizes the risk associated with this stock.  Any investment strategy should account for this substantial risk and consider a long-term perspective, given the volatility and the expected long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, which could be subject to change based on market conditions.
