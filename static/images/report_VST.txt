**5. Financial Information:**

The report states that "No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data available for VST." This lack of crucial financial data severely limits a comprehensive analysis.  Further data is needed.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) exhibits exceptionally high cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500, driven by a significant surge in recent years. However, this outperformance is accompanied by high volatility and a lack of consistent positive Alpha.  Technical indicators (RSI nearing overbought, negative PPO) suggest potential short-term downside risk.  Crucially, the absence of key financial data (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) and the highly volatile earnings make it difficult to assess the long-term sustainability of VST's performance and the validity of the projected 6.1% excess return.  More detailed financial information and a deeper understanding of the drivers of recent earnings growth are necessary before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The data provided suggests a high-risk, high-reward profile.
