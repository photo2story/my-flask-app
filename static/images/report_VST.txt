**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $118.02
* **5-day Moving Average:** $105.84
* **20-day Moving Average:** $120.48
* **60-day Moving Average:** $143.37

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  The recent price increase from the previous close ($102.19 to $118.02) indicates a significant jump (15.49). This sharp increase warrants further investigation into the underlying factors driving this price action.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.64 (below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.57 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -11.9% (short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 4.9% (This represents potential excess returns relative to the S&P 500 over the long term - 2 years or more.)

The combination of a high MRI, low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence change points towards a bearish short-term outlook.  However, the significant positive long-term expected return suggests potential for long-term investors. The recent sharp price increase needs further analysis to determine its sustainability.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) has demonstrated substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  However, this performance is characterized by high volatility and risk, as indicated by high MDD, a high Market Risk Indicator, and fluctuating financial metrics.  The recent sharp price increase needs further investigation to assess its sustainability. While the long-term expected return is positive, investors should be aware of the significant short-term risks.  Thorough due diligence, including understanding the drivers of the recent earnings surge and price jump, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility suggests that VST is not suitable for risk-averse investors.
