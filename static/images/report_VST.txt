## Vistra Corp (VST) Stock Report

This report analyzes Vistra Corp (VST), a leading energy company, based on the provided data.


**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Vistra Corp's cumulative return (255.59%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (61.35%).  The difference is 194.2 percentage points.  This places the stock at the 58.3rd percentile of its historical relative divergence range (max: 384.0, min: -71.5), indicating it's performed substantially better than the S&P 500 over the considered period but not at its historical peak relative performance.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows significant volatility in performance relative to the market (beta ranging from 0.1 to 1.5), with periods of substantial outperformance (e.g., 2022-2025) and underperformance (e.g., 2017-2019).  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) suggests growing investor interest, particularly in recent years.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $126.64
* **5-day Moving Average:** $118.00
* **20-day Moving Average:** $114.29
* **60-day Moving Average:** $133.24

The recent closing price is above the 5 and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend but a longer-term downtrend since the 60 day average is significantly above the recent closing price.  The increase from the previous close ($124.23 to $126.64) indicates a recent positive trend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 71.71 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.09 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 9.4% (Long-term, S&P 500 outperformance)

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought, indicating a potential correction. However, the positive PPO and recent price increase signal continued upward momentum in the short term. The positive relative divergence change further reinforces this. The expected return is significantly higher than the market, suggesting strong long-term potential.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-11-08 | 5.36  | $4.34B        |

| 2024-11-08 | 1.27  | $4.79B        | *(Duplicate entry - potential data error)*


Earnings are highly volatile.  There's a significant jump in EPS in November 2024 which needs further investigation. The apparent duplication of the November 2024 data needs clarification. Revenue fluctuates considerably between quarters.

Both revenue and profitability show considerable fluctuation.  ROE is also volatile, highlighting the risk associated with this stock.  The September 2024 quarter shows exceptionally high profitability, requiring further investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, but this performance is highly volatile.  Recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, but technical indicators suggest potential overbought conditions.  Earnings and financial data are highly variable. While the long-term expected return is attractive, the high volatility and considerable risk (indicated by the fluctuating ROE and substantial swings in EPS and Revenue) necessitate a careful assessment of risk tolerance before investing.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the significant fluctuations in quarterly results and the exceptionally high EPS and profitability in certain quarters.  Data inconsistencies should also be addressed.
