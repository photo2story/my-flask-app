**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $168.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $169.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $170.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $156.67

The price is currently below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it is significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The recent price increase of $0.89 (0.53%) from the previous close suggests a minor upward movement.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (42.88):**  Slightly below 50, suggesting the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning towards oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.63):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-0.4):**  Shows a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (5.4%):**  Suggests a potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment.  This needs to be viewed in context of the high volatility seen historically.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-08 | 5.36   | $4.34B        |
| 2024-08-09 | 0.92   | $3.60B        |
| 2024-05-10 | -0.24  | $3.16B        |
| 2023-11-07 | 1.27   | $4.79B        |
| 2024-11-08 | 1.27   | $4.79B        |

There's a duplicate entry for 2024-11-08.  EPS and revenue show significant volatility quarter-to-quarter.  The November 2024 earnings are unusually high compared to previous quarters. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind this variability.


**5) Financial Information:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|

| 2024-06-30 | $3.85B | 42.13% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.05B | 27.50% |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.08B | 27.62% |
| 2023-09-30 | $4.09B | 38.33% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|

| 2024-06-30 | $5.59B | 6.53% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.66B | -0.62% |
| 2023-12-31 | $5.31B | -3.47% |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.51B | 9.12% |

Both revenue and profitability, and equity and ROE show significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  The high profit margin in Q3 2024 warrants further investigation.  The negative ROE in Q1 and Q4 2024 is a cause for concern.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) has demonstrated exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with significant volatility and risk as evidenced by the high maximum drawdown values in the provided data. While the recent price action shows some weakness, the long-term trend is positive, supported by the higher 60-day moving average.  The highly volatile earnings and financial information require careful scrutiny.  The extremely high CAGR in recent years (2022-2025)  should be viewed with caution considering the potentially unsustainable nature of such growth,  and the corresponding risk profile.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the underlying drivers of this volatility and the exceptionally high earnings in Q3 2024, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high beta also indicates significant market sensitivity.  The projected long-term return of 5.4% is promising, but only if the underlying volatility can be managed.
