Further investigation into the underlying factors contributing to the volatility in earnings, revenue, and ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Investors should thoroughly review financial statements and consider their risk tolerance before investing.  The extremely high CAGR in the latest period should be analyzed for sustainability before drawing conclusions.
