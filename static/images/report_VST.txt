**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

VST's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  The substantial difference highlights potential outperformance, but also carries higher risk given the high volatility implied by the data.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this performance.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

Vistra Corp (VST) is an independent power producer and energy storage solutions provider.

* **VST Cumulative Return:** 719.52%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 111.16%
* **Return Difference:** 608.4%
* **Relative Divergence:** 85.7% (This means the current performance difference relative to the S&P 500 is at the 85.7th percentile of the historical range of differences.)

The table below shows the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and market capitalization (Cap) for different periods. Noteworthy is the dramatic increase in CAGR and Alpha in the later periods, which is the main driver of the substantial outperformance. The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2016-2018  | 33.0% | 6.5% | 24.0% | 0.1 | 6.7 |

**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $168.59
* **Last Market Price:** $168.53
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $163.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $168.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $153.76

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term pullback. The price is significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.  The recent price increase (0.30) is minor and doesn't signal a dramatic upswing.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 52.28 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.8991 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +18.5% (Positive, indicating short-term upward momentum)

The conflicting signals from the PPO and the relative divergence suggest caution. While the recent price change is positive, the relatively low RSI and negative PPO warrant a cautious approach. The expected return of 4.6% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is positive.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-08 | 5.36   | $4.34 B     |
| 2024-08-09 | 0.92   | $3.60 B     |
| 2024-05-10 | -0.24  | $3.16 B     |
| 2023-11-07 | 1.27   | $4.79 B     |
| 2024-11-08 | 1.27   | $4.79 B     | *(Note: Duplicate entry.  This likely represents a reporting error and should be verified)*


Earnings show significant variability.  The November 2024 EPS is unusually high compared to previous quarters and warrants further investigation to confirm the accuracy of the data.   Revenue generally demonstrates growth but needs further analysis to understand underlying factors driving variability.

Both revenue and profitability show considerable fluctuation quarter-over-quarter.  The high profit margin in Q3 2024 is notable and needs further investigation to determine sustainability. ROE also demonstrates volatility, highlighting the company's risk profile.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

VST exhibits exceptional cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500, driven by exceptionally high growth in the latest period. However, this performance is accompanied by high volatility and a high beta, indicating significant market sensitivity.  The recent earnings data shows inconsistency, needing further clarification on the accuracy of reported numbers (particularly the November 2024 figures).  Financial information reveals significant quarterly variations in both revenue and profitability, underlining the company's cyclical nature. While the long-term expected return is positive, investors should exercise caution due to the inherent volatility and need for further due diligence to understand the drivers behind the recent significant growth.  The inconsistent financial data requires further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions.
