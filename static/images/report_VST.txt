**5. Financial Information:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

VST has shown exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial risk.  High volatility, overbought RSI, and inconsistent earnings raise serious concerns.  The lack of crucial financial data further hinders a complete assessment. While the long-term expected return is positive, the high risk profile and volatile performance warrant extreme caution.  Further investigation into the May 2025 earnings report and the missing financial data is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Consider diversifying your portfolio and only allocating a small portion of your investment capital to VST given its inherent risk profile.
