The recent price drop of $0.72, while not a significant crash, reflects some profit-taking after a strong run-up.

However, the long-term outlook remains positive given the expected return of 5%.

Vistra Corp (VST) has shown remarkable long-term returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500. However, this performance comes with high volatility, both in terms of price and earnings.

While technical indicators suggest some weakening momentum, the long-term outlook remains positive based on the high expected return relative to the S&P 500.  Nevertheless, investors should be aware of the significant volatility and conduct thorough due diligence, particularly regarding the fluctuating earnings and ROE figures.  Further investigation into the reasons for the exceptionally high EPS in November 2024 and the negative ROE values in Q1 and Q4 2024 is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high Beta in recent years also suggests increased sensitivity to market fluctuations.
