* **5-Day Moving Average:** $114.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $121.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $146.13

The stock price is currently significantly below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price change of -$9.37 represents a substantial daily drop.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 30.43 (Below 30 suggests the stock may be oversold.)
* **PPO:** -1.03 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.)

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative expected return indicates a bearish outlook in the short-term.  The significant price drop of -$9.37 confirms this bearish trend.  The high MRI score further supports the high-risk assessment.  However, the long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not provided and would need further analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

VST has shown remarkable outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, but this comes with considerable volatility and risk. The recent price drop and negative technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  While the long-term potential seems high based on past performance, the high level of risk, as indicated by the MRI and the high volatility in both earnings and financial metrics, requires careful consideration.  Further investigation into the specific drivers of the recent price decline and clarification of some data inconsistencies (such as the duplicate earnings entry) is necessary before making any investment decisions.  A thorough due diligence process, including a review of the company’s financial statements, industry trends, and competitive landscape, is highly recommended.
