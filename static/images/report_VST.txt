## Vistra Corp (VST) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) is an energy company involved in power generation and retail energy sales.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with substantially higher cumulative returns and volatility.  Further analysis is required to determine the sustainability of this performance.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **VST Cumulative Return:** 194.11%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 47.96%
* **Return Difference:** 146.2%  (This represents the difference in cumulative returns between VST and VOO at the last data point.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 51.3% (This indicates VST's performance is in the 51st percentile of its historical divergence from VOO, suggesting significant outperformance but also potential for mean reversion.)

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and varying levels of outperformance (Alpha) relative to the market (Beta).  The high Beta values indicate significant market sensitivity. Note the dramatic increases in Alpha and Beta in the last two years which are driven by huge return increases during this period.  Itâ€™s important to investigate the drivers of this recent significant jump in performance to assess its sustainability.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $109.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $106.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $120.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $142.35

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price drop of $7.42 (from $118.02 to $109.26)  indicates a significant negative shift in price.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.21 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.3991 (Negative, indicating bearish trend)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 5.4% (This is an *additional* expected return compared to the S&P 500, meaning an overall expected return higher than that of S&P 500).  This suggests that even given the current short-term bearish signal, long-term investment potentially offers an additional return above the benchmark market.

The significant negative price change (-7.42)  reinforces the bearish signals from the RSI, PPO, and moving averages.  The significant drop likely warrants investigating underlying market events for this price decline.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-11-08 | 5.36  | $4.34B       |
| 2024-08-09 | 0.92  | $3.60B       |

| 2024-11-08 | 1.27  | $4.79B       |


There's a potential duplication of data for November 8th, 2024.  EPS and revenue figures show significant volatility.  The substantial increase in EPS in November 2024 needs further investigation to understand the underlying drivers.  Further analysis needs to reconcile this duplicated data point to ensure accuracy in the trend analysis.

Revenue and profit margins show significant quarterly fluctuations.  ROE also displays high volatility.  This highlights the inherent risk associated with this investment.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term but with considerable volatility.  Recent price action suggests a bearish trend, supported by technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages).  The significant recent earnings increase warrants further investigation to determine sustainability.  The high volatility and fluctuation in financial metrics (revenue, profit margin, ROE) suggest a higher-risk investment.  While the projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of 5.4% above the S&P 500 is attractive, investors should carefully consider the significant risks inherent in VST's volatile performance before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the underlying drivers of recent price movements and earnings, is crucial before forming a definitive opinion.
