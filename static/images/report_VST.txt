**7. Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) has demonstrated extraordinary returns significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, this performance is accompanied by significant volatility in both price and financial metrics.  The high RSI and recent short-term negative divergence suggest a potential near-term correction.  While the long-term expected return is positive, the inherent volatility poses considerable risk.  The inconsistent and incomplete earnings data necessitates further investigation.  Investors should proceed with caution, considering the high risk associated with VST's performance and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying drivers of its volatility before making investment decisions.  The high beta also indicates that it will be strongly affected by market downturns.
