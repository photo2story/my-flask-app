**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Vistra Corp's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference is 724.4 percentage points, representing a substantial outperformance.  The relative divergence is at its maximum observed value (100% on the provided scale), indicating exceptional performance compared to the historical data range.  However, it's crucial to understand that this doesn't guarantee future outperformance.

* **20-day Moving Average:** $161.18
* **60-day Moving Average:** $149.01

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  However, the recent price dip might indicate some short-term consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp has shown remarkable past performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this past performance is not indicative of future results.  The current high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought.  While recent price action is positive, the significant volatility in earnings, profit margins, and ROE raises concerns about the sustainability of its performance.  The 2.5% expected excess return over the long term is relatively modest, given the substantial past outperformance.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The data provided shows a high degree of volatility, highlighting the inherent risk in this investment.
