The current price of VST is $108.21, significantly below its 5-day ($118.83), 20-day ($122.35), and 60-day ($147.22) moving averages. This suggests a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The large negative change from the previous close (-$14.92) indicates a recent sharp decline.

The expected return of 26% over the long term (2+ years) suggests potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500, despite current bearish indicators. The low-to-medium MRI suggests a relatively manageable level of market risk.

The data inconsistencies need to be addressed. Despite the current bearish trend, the long-term expected return remains positive, suggesting that a long-term investment strategy might be considered, but only after a thorough investigation of the reasons behind the recent sharp price drop and the unusual earnings figures.  Further due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions.
