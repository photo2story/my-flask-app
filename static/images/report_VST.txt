## Vistra Corp (VST) Stock Report

This report analyzes Vistra Corp (VST), a leading energy company in the United States, based on the provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

VST's cumulative return (255.59%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (61.35%).  The difference is 194.2%, placing it at the 58.3rd percentile of the historical divergence range (-71.5% to 384.0%). This indicates VST's performance has been considerably stronger than the broader market over the analyzed period.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable alpha and beta values across different time periods. While recent years (2021-2025) show strong positive alpha (1.2 to 1.5) and high beta (12.9 to 46.8), earlier periods exhibit much lower or even negative alpha and less volatile beta.  This suggests significant volatility in VST's performance relative to the market, potentially driven by company-specific factors or market sector trends. The high beta in recent years highlights its sensitivity to market fluctuations.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $126.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $118.00
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $114.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $133.24

The price is currently above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential pullback from a recent high.  The significant jump from the previous close ($124.23) to the current price ($126.64) represents a 1.94 increase, reflecting a noticeable short-term upward movement.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 71.71 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.09 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Divergence:** +5.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 9.4% (Long-term S&P 500 outperformance)

The relatively high RSI suggests a potential short-term correction might be due.  However, the positive PPO and recent divergence reinforce the short-term bullish sentiment. The 9.4% expected return over the long term (2+ years) suggests a significant potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500. The recent price increase should be considered within the context of this overall positive outlook.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility. While there were strong EPS figures in November 2024 and November 2023, there was a significant loss in May 2024.  Revenue generally increased,  but the inconsistency in EPS highlights considerable fluctuations in profitability. Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying causes of this volatility.

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2024-11-08 | 5.36  | 4.34 B$     |

**5) Financial Information:**

The financial data shows a mixed picture. While revenue has generally increased, profit margins show significant fluctuations across quarters.  Similarly, ROE has been highly volatile, ranging from a negative value to a high of 34.70%.  This suggests potential challenges in maintaining consistent profitability and efficiency.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

**6) Overall Analysis:**

VST has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years.  However, this performance is characterized by considerable volatility, both in terms of price movements and profitability.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity. While long-term prospects appear positive based on the expected return, investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with the company's fluctuating earnings and substantial price swings.  Further investigation into the drivers of this volatility (e.g., industry trends, company-specific events) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests that while potentially rewarding, VST presents a higher-risk investment than a broad market index fund.  Careful monitoring and a long-term investment horizon are advisable.
