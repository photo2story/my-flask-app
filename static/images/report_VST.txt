The table shows highly volatile performance with significant periods of both high gains and losses.  Alpha values fluctuate considerably, suggesting periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (beta is consistently low, suggesting low market correlation).


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $112.69
* **5-day Moving Average:** $110.77
* **20-day Moving Average:** $118.76
* **60-day Moving Average:** $140.38

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $0.88 (from $111.71 to $112.69) is a modest positive change and doesn't indicate a significant reversal.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.93 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.2151 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum but weak)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 5.8% (above S&P 500)

The high MRI suggests caution.  While RSI is approaching oversold levels, it's not a strong buy signal on its own. The positive PPO and expected return are positive signs, but need to be considered within the context of the other indicators and the high risk profile.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-11-08 | 5.36  | $4.34 B      |

| 2024-11-08 | 1.27  | $4.79 B      |

There's a significant jump in EPS in the most recent quarter (November 2024) which requires further investigation to determine the cause (potential one-off item or structural shift). Revenue fluctuates but does not show a clear pattern.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

VST has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility. While recent price action shows a downtrend, the high expected return and positive PPO suggest potential for future growth. However, the high market risk indicator, mixed technical indicators, and volatile earnings and financial data warrant caution.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent EPS surge and the variability in revenue and profitability is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough understanding of the company's business model and future outlook is necessary to assess the risk-reward profile adequately.
