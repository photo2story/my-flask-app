**5. Financial Information:**

No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data is available.  This significantly limits a complete financial analysis.  Further data is needed.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

VST has shown exceptionally strong performance compared to the S&P 500, driven by significant increases in recent quarters. However, this performance is accompanied by high volatility (reflected in the large swings in CAGR and Alpha) and high risk as evidenced by the beta.  The high RSI suggests a potential short-term pullback is possible, though positive PPO and recent relative divergence indicate continued short term bullishness. The lack of crucial financial data (total revenue, gross profit) prevents a comprehensive evaluation of VST's financial health and long-term sustainability.  Investors should proceed with caution, carefully considering the high risk and volatility associated with this stock despite the strong historical returns.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's financial statements and future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
