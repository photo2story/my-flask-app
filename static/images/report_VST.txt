## Vistra Corp (VST) Stock Report

This report analyzes Vistra Corp (VST), an energy company involved in electricity generation and retail energy sales.


**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

VST's cumulative return of 288.28% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 65.36%.  The difference is 222.94%, placing it at the 64.6th percentile of the historical divergence range (-71.5% to 384.0%).  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the market historically, although past performance doesn't guarantee future results.  The high Beta values (mostly above 6) highlight VST's high sensitivity to market movements, especially in periods of high volatility.  The Alpha values fluctuate significantly, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  The dramatic increase in both CAGR and return observed in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 warrants further investigation.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $139.28
* **5-day Moving Average:** $133.03
* **20-day Moving Average:** $117.84
* **60-day Moving Average:** $130.14

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively large gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a recent acceleration in the price increase.  The price change of $1.44 from the previous close represents a 1.05% increase, suggesting a recent small upward momentum.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 79.42 (Overbought)
* **PPO:** 2.79 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.3% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 8.6% (over S&P 500, for long-term investment over 2 years)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a correction.  However, the positive PPO and the upward trend in relative divergence indicate continued short-term strength.  The moderately high expected return indicates significant upside potential relative to the market but requires careful risk management, considering the high RSI.  The price increase is relatively modest and doesn't signal a significant 'sharp' upward or downward movement.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-11-08 | 5.36  | $4.34 B       |

| 2024-11-08 | 1.27  | $4.79 B       |

There is a discrepancy in the November 2024 data.  EPS shows significant fluctuation quarter-over-quarter. Revenue generally shows more stability but with some volatility. The November 2024 data needs clarification to accurately assess earnings trends.

Equity remains relatively stable, but ROE shows significant volatility, mirroring the revenue and profit margin patterns.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

VST has shown exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, particularly in the last two years.  However, this performance is accompanied by significant volatility in earnings, revenue, and profitability, and high Beta suggesting significant market risk. The high RSI indicates potential overvaluation and a possible correction.  While the long-term expected return is promising, investors should carefully consider the high risk profile before investing.  Further investigation into the drivers of earnings and revenue volatility, and clarification on the November 2024 data, is necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.  The high Beta and fluctuating Alpha values suggest a need for a well-diversified portfolio and a robust risk management strategy.
