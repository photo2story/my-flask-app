The table below shows a significant outperformance of VST compared to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years (2021-2025).  However, the low beta suggests limited correlation with the market, implying the high returns are likely driven by factors specific to VST, not broad market movements.  The alpha also suggests significant outperformance, though its consistency across periods needs examination.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This critical data is necessary to assess the financial health and sustainability of VST's performance.

**6. Overall Summary:**

Vistra Corp (VST) exhibits exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, especially in recent years.  However, this outperformance is not consistently reflected across all periods and the underlying reasons need thorough investigation. Technical indicators suggest a potentially overbought market and some bearish momentum.  The lack of crucial financial data prevents a complete assessment.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of VST's financials and business strategy, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high alpha and low beta are noteworthy but require careful consideration of the associated risk. The expected return is positive but depends heavily on the sustainability of current trends.
