## Vistra Corp (VST) Stock Report

This report analyzes Vistra Corp (VST), an energy company, based on the provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Vistra Corp's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **VST Cumulative Return:** 248.86%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 60.19%
* **Return Difference:** 188.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 57.1% (This indicates that VST's outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is in the upper 57.1 percentile of its historical range.  It doesn't imply a 57.1% superior return, but a high relative performance compared to its past performance fluctuations.)


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility and varying performance depending on the time period.  While recent years (2022-2025) show exceptionally high CAGR and Alpha, indicating significant outperformance, earlier periods display negative or low returns and negative alpha. The high Beta (generally above 6, except for 2018-2020) signifies high sensitivity to market movements.  This suggests that while VST has the potential for substantial returns, it carries considerable risk.

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term uptrend. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential pullback from recent highs.  The recent price change of $3.53 shows a significant daily increase. This could indicate a short-term upward trend or a temporary jump.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While some quarters show strong EPS and revenue growth, others exhibit losses.  There also seems to be a data duplication for 2024-11-08.  Further investigation into the data consistency is necessary.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-11-08 | 5.36 | $4.34 B       |
| 2024-08-09 | 0.92 | $3.60 B       |
| 2024-05-10 | -0.24 | $3.16 B       |
| 2023-11-07 | 1.27 | $4.79 B       |
| 2024-11-08 | 1.27 | $4.79 B       | *(Duplicate Data?)*


**5) Financial Information:**

The financial statements indicate fluctuating profitability and return on equity (ROE).  While some quarters show high profit margins and ROE, others reveal lower profitability and even negative ROE. This again points to volatility and the need for careful consideration of the underlying business performance.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $4.04B | 39.63% |
| 2024-09-30 | $6.29B | 55.10% |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.85B | 42.13% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.05B | 27.50% |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.08B | 27.62% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $5.57B | 7.92% |
| 2024-09-30 | $5.44B | 34.70% |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.59B | 6.53% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.66B | -0.62% |
| 2023-12-31 | $5.31B | -3.47% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) exhibits a high growth potential but with substantial risk due to its high volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations (high beta).  The recent strong performance and positive technical indicators suggest a bullish short-term outlook, but the inconsistent earnings and financial data require careful evaluation.  The high expected return over the S&P 500 for long-term investment is contingent upon this volatility not negatively affecting the company. Thorough due diligence, including a deeper analysis of the underlying business and risk factors, is crucial before making any investment decision.  The duplicate data point in the earnings data necessitates clarification.
