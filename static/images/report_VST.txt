## Vistra Corp (VST) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

VST's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting substantial growth.  However, recent price movements suggest a potential short-term correction.  Profitability shows fluctuations, warranting further investigation.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Vistra Corp (VST) is a provider of energy solutions and services.

* **VST Cumulative Return:** 263.11%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 62.42%
* **Return Difference:** 200.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 59.8% (This means VST's outperformance relative to VOO is in the upper 59.8th percentile of its historical range).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals high volatility and significant outperformance in recent years (2022-2024), potentially driven by specific market conditions and company-specific factors.  However,  periods of negative alpha and high beta suggest susceptibility to market downturns.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) also reflects this growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $129.33
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $125.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $115.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $131.83

The price is slightly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a minor pullback after a period of strong growth.  The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating short-term upward momentum, despite the small daily decrease (-0.22).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 71.22 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.49 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +8.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 9.4% (outperformance relative to S&P 500)

The RSI nearing 70 indicates potential overbought conditions, suggesting a possible short-term correction.  The positive PPO supports the short-term upward trend, but the MRI suggests only moderate risk.  The daily price decrease of -$0.22 is relatively minor and doesn't suggest a significant sudden downturn.  The high expected return is promising for long-term investors.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

VST has demonstrated exceptional growth significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, this growth is accompanied by considerable volatility, as evidenced by the high beta and fluctuating earnings.  The recent price movement suggests a possible short-term correction, but the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by a high expected return.  However,  a thorough investigation into the recent earnings surge and the substantial fluctuations in revenue, profit margins, and ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry) necessitate further verification.  Due diligence, including examining the company's financial statements and future projections, is strongly recommended.
