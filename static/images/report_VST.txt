This report analyzes Vistra Corp (VST), a large electric power company.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

VST's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  VST shows a cumulative return of 532.01% while VOO shows 106.55%.  The difference is 425.5%, placing it at the 63rd percentile of the historical range (max: 724.4%, min: -84.1%). This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility and varying performance over different periods.  While recent years (2021-2025) show exceptionally high CAGR and Alpha, indicating strong outperformance, earlier periods demonstrate significant losses and negative Alpha. The high Beta values (mostly above 6) consistently indicate high sensitivity to market movements. The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the last two years supports the high CAGR observed in that period.  This underlines the need for careful consideration of the risk associated with this stock due to its high beta and volatility.
