Vistra Corp (VST) is an energy company.  The provided data shows VST significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return of VST is 610.3 percentage points higher than VOO's return.  However, the relative divergence metric suggests this outperformance is at the high end of historical variation.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The alpha and beta values fluctuate significantly across the years.  Early years showed positive alpha indicating outperformance, but later years (2019-2021) show negative alpha, suggesting underperformance relative to the market.  The remarkably high alpha and CAGR in the most recent years (2022-2025) warrants further investigation and may be driven by specific market conditions or company-specific events.  The high Beta consistently points to the stock's high sensitivity to market movements.  Market cap shows significant growth.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

The current price ($168.03) is slightly below the 20-day moving average ($167.75) and significantly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests some short-term price consolidation or minor downward correction after a recent rally.  The recent price drop of $4.69 indicates a potential short-term bearish signal, despite the overall long-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 50.45 is near the neutral level, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  The negative PPO (-1.01) suggests bearish momentum. The recent 20-day relative divergence change of -13.7% confirms a short-term downward trend. The substantial recent price drop (-$4.69) needs further investigation to understand underlying causes.  The 4.5% expected return is relative to the S&P 500 and assumes a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

VST has demonstrated exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, particularly in the most recent period.  However, this performance shows high volatility and significant fluctuations in alpha, beta, earnings, and financial ratios. The recent price drop and mixed technical indicators suggest caution.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the drivers of recent high growth (especially the massive increase in the 2022-2025 period), the reasons for the variable profitability, and the sustainability of the recent earnings surge is crucial.  The high beta highlights the stock's risk profile. A long-term perspective with a thorough understanding of the company's fundamentals and business model is essential for assessing the validity of the 4.5% expected return against the S&P 500.  Consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
