The earnings data shows considerable volatility, requiring further investigation to understand the underlying drivers. While the long-term expected return is positive, potential investors should be aware of the high risk associated with this stock due to its high volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations.  A thorough fundamental analysis, considering factors beyond the scope of this report, is crucial before making any investment decision.  The data provided contains inconsistencies (duplicate entry for November 2024 earnings) that need to be clarified.
