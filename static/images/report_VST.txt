*   **[2025-12-02]** Vistra raised to investment grade by S&P
*   **[2025-12-16]** Today's Analyst Rating: JP Morgan Lowers Price Target for VST

**Analysis:** Recent news is mixed. The S&P upgrade is positive.  The articles about interest rates and growth strategy are forward-looking. The mention of a CEO stock sale is a potential negative that requires further investigation to understand the context (e.g., size of sale, reasons for sale). The JP Morgan lowering of the price target is also negative and warrants review of the analyst's rationale.  The overall sentiment seems cautiously optimistic.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (1.55 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Opinions:** 21
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 233.29 / High: 324.00 / Low: 86.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  (No changes provided)

**Analysis:** The strong "Buy" consensus among a large number of analysts (21) is a positive signal.  The average target price of $233.29 suggests significant upside potential from the current price of $173.45. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates some uncertainty among analysts. The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess recent sentiment shifts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-11-07 | 1.78   | 4.78 B$      |

| 2025-11-07 | 5.36   | 4.34 B$      |

**Analysis:** The earnings data shows fluctuating performance. EPS was positive in two of the last three quarters, with a significant spike in 2024-11-08 and 2025-11-07. Revenue has also fluctuated. This suggests potential cyclicality or sensitivity to external factors.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Vistra Corp (VST) has demonstrated strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500, driven by company-specific factors as indicated by its Alpha. However, it exhibits significant price volatility (high MDD) and its stock price is not strongly correlated with the overall market (low Beta).

Recent performance (2022-2025) has been excellent, leading to a surge in market capitalization. Analyst consensus is strongly positive, with significant upside potential implied by the average target price.

However, there are potential concerns:

*   **Fluctuating Financial Performance:** Revenue, EPS, profit margins, and ROE all demonstrate variability, suggesting potential sensitivity to external factors or cyclicality in the business.
*   **Recent Negative News:** The JP Morgan price target reduction and news of a CEO stock sale warrant closer scrutiny.
*   **Short-Term Downtrend:** The relative divergence and moving average analysis suggest a potential short-term downtrend.

**Conclusion:**

VST appears to be a potentially attractive investment for long-term investors seeking outperformance, but requires careful consideration of its volatility and the potential risks associated with its fluctuating financial performance and recent negative news items. It would be prudent to investigate the reasons for the JP Morgan price target reduction and the CEO stock sale before making an investment decision. The recent Hybrid signal from the data suggests a strong buy, so that needs to be reconciled with the recent negative news and the JP Morgan price target reduction.
