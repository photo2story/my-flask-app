**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Vistra Corp (VST) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative return. However, recent performance indicators suggest some cause for concern. While analyst consensus is bullish, the stock is exhibiting a short-term downward trend.

*   **Positives:** High expected return (36%), positive analyst ratings and target prices, and a history of outperforming the S&P 500. Good Market Risk Indicator. The Hybrid Signal is favorable.
*   **Negatives:** Recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by the negative change in relative divergence, recent price decline, and mixed news sentiment. The high MDD means that investment could be very risky, since the value of the investment could fall dramatically. EPS is highly volatile.
*   **Mixed:** The fluctuating revenue, profit margin, and ROE suggest potential inconsistencies or cyclicality in the business. The negative Beta has turned positive, which could be a positive or a negative depending on your perspective.
*   **Conclusion:**
    Given the analyst ratings and expected returns, investing in VST could be potentially very lucrative in the long term. However, the high MDD, recent market performance and financial performance may represent significant risk. You should carefully review your risk tolerance, do additional research on the underlying causes of the recent short-term decline, consider that VST's Hybrid Signal is bullish (buy 100% of cash), and proceed accordingly.
