This report analyzes Vistra Corp (VST), an independent power producer and energy storage company.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

VST's cumulative return of 374.24% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 81.92%.  The difference is 292.3%, placing it at the 63.1st percentile of the historical divergence range (max: 509.2%, min: -79.4%). This indicates that VST's performance has been considerably stronger than the broader market over the observed period.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility in Alpha and Beta, reflecting the risk associated with VST's performance. While high positive alpha values in recent years suggest outperformance relative to the market, the significant fluctuations warrant careful consideration of risk.  The dramatically increasing Beta suggests increased market sensitivity, particularly in the last two years. This is also reflected in the high CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values which show high growth potential but also substantial risk of loss.

While the high expected return is attractive,  investors should carefully consider the substantial risk associated with this stock.  Further due diligence, including a thorough understanding of the underlying business drivers and future market conditions, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistent financial performance requires more in-depth analysis to determine the sustainability of future growth.
