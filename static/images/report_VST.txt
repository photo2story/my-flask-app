**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Vistra Corp (VST) shows significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price action indicates a short-term decline, while longer-term moving averages suggest a potential upward trend reversal.  Earnings show volatility but positive overall momentum. Financial information points to fluctuating profitability but strong equity position.  Detailed analysis follows.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Vistra Corp is an independent power producer and energy storage provider.

* **Cumulative Return (VST):** 699.43%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 98.67%
* **Return Difference:** 600.8% (This is significantly higher than the S&P 500.  The relative divergence of 88.8% indicates VST's performance is in the top 90th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.)

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals significant volatility in performance relative to the market (high Beta values) and varying levels of alpha (outperformance relative to the market).

However, the significant volatility warrants caution.

* **Previous Close:** $131.90
* **5-day Moving Average:** $128.48
* **20-day Moving Average:** $126.27
* **60-day Moving Average:** $150.81

The price has recently decreased slightly, trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but significantly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend or correction after a substantial rally.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.92 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 8.2% (above S&P 500)

The technical indicators present a mixed but generally positive outlook.  The recent price decrease (-1.0) is not significant enough to signal a sharp reversal, but it does represent a short-term correction. The positive PPO and upward relative divergence suggest continued bullish momentum in the medium term. The high expected return reflects the potential for significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term, but this is contingent on the continuation of the current positive momentum, which is not guaranteed given historical volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-08 | 5.36   | $4.34 B      |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) has exhibited exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, driven by periods of strong alpha and exceptionally high CAGR, most notably in the last two years. However, this performance is accompanied by substantial volatility, reflected in both price movements and financial data.  The recent price decrease suggests a potential short-term correction.  Technical indicators provide a mixed signal, while the high expected return indicates long-term potential, contingent on risk tolerance and further analysis of underlying factors driving the high volatility.  A thorough review of the earnings volatility and a deeper dive into the drivers of both the high returns and high risk is essential before making any investment decisions.  The significant fluctuations warrant cautious consideration of risk tolerance.
