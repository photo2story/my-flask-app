## Vistra Corp (VST) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Vistra Corp (VST), an energy company, using provided financial data.  We will examine its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial statements.


**1) Performance vs. S&P 500:**

Vistra Corp (VST) shows a cumulative return of 237.12%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 56.99%.  The difference is 180.1%, placing it at the 55.2nd percentile of the historical range of the relative divergence (max: 384.0, min: -71.5).  This indicates that VST's outperformance is substantial compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (Beta reflects market sensitivity).  The high Beta values (mostly above 6) suggest VST is highly sensitive to market fluctuations.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and considerable MDD (Maximum Drawdown) further demonstrate significant volatility. Noteworthy is the substantial growth from 2022-2024 (334% CAGR) driven by a strong Alpha.  This period suggests an impressive outperformance exceeding market expectations and justifies higher volatility.  From 2017-2019, the negative CAGR highlights a period of underperformance.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

VST has shown exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, particularly in the recent period (2022-2024).  However, this outperformance comes with significant volatility, as reflected in the high Beta and MDD values, and fluctuating earnings and ROE.  The recent price surge suggests a positive market event, but the price is currently trading below its 60-day moving average. While the long-term expected return is positive, investors should be aware of the high risk associated with VST's volatility.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the earnings data is required for a more comprehensive assessment.  The high profit margins suggest strong profitability when performing well, but the consistency of this needs further scrutiny.  A deeper dive into the underlying drivers of the recent price jump and the volatility in earnings and ROE is recommended before making any investment decisions.
