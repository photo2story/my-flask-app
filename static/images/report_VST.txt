**6. Overall Analysis:**

Vistra Corp (VST) has shown remarkable outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  However, this performance is characterized by significant volatility, both in terms of price and financial metrics.  The high alpha in recent periods is promising, but the fluctuating profitability and high beta suggest a riskier investment.  The recent price action, while showing a slight upward trend, is below key moving averages.  Further investigation into the drivers of the earnings and financial volatility, as well as a deeper analysis of the company's business model and future prospects, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The provided 5.8% expected return over two years or more is promising, but the inherent risk should be carefully considered.  Data discrepancies should be clarified before drawing definitive conclusions.
