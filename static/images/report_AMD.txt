**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors.  AMD's cumulative return (1097.89%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (120.91%) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is 977.0, placing it at the 51st percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures in the provided data (ranging from 169% to 1370%) demonstrate periods of exceptional growth, although 2020-2022 shows a significant negative CAGR. Note that the provided Alpha values are consistently 0.0, requiring further investigation into the calculation methodology used.  The high Beta values indicate significant market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $126.91
* **5-day Moving Average:** $129.25
* **20-day Moving Average:** $136.66
* **60-day Moving Average:** $149.70

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.09):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.58):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-5.5):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2301.6%):**  This incredibly high figure needs further clarification on the calculation methodology and underlying assumptions, particularly given the recent price decline and negative CAGR shown in certain periods.  It is crucial to assess this expectation with extreme caution.  The current price ($126.91) does not reflect any drastic recent price changes that would suggest a significant sudden surge or crash.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals a mixed picture:

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally exhibits an upward trend, although growth isn't consistent across quarters.  The most recent quarter shows a significant increase compared to the previous quarter ($6.82B vs $5.83B).
* **EPS:** EPS shows significant fluctuation.  There's a large increase in the most recent quarter ($0.48) compared to the previous ones ($0.16, $0.08, $0.18, $0.18), but this requires further investigation as to the reasons for this increase.
* **Comparison:**  Without access to expectations, a meaningful comparison of beats or misses is not possible.  The available data only allows for a within-company comparison.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows growth, while profit margins are relatively stable and high, generally above 46%.  This is a positive indicator of profitability and efficiency.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing, although ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, suggesting variations in the company's efficiency in utilizing its equity.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  The prompt mentions "recent 2 days earnings news," "Recent Market Outlook," and "Analyst Opinions," but this data has not been provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD's long-term performance against the S&P 500 has been remarkably strong, with periods of substantial growth.  However, recent price action shows a downtrend, with the stock trading below its moving averages.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the negative PPO and recent relative divergence signal bearish momentum.  The most recent earnings report shows a significant increase in both revenue and EPS compared to the prior quarter, but the overall trend is inconsistent over the provided time span.  The extremely high projected long-term return requires significant scrutiny and additional information regarding its calculation.  Further analysis is needed to reconcile the high historical performance with current negative momentum indicators.  Crucially, missing information regarding recent news, market outlook and analyst opinions prevents a comprehensive assessment.  Investors should conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistency in the data and the lack of context surrounding the provided numbers require more in-depth analysis to provide more solid conclusions.
