## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, and related technologies.

Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), AMD has significantly outperformed over the period considered.  The cumulative return for AMD is 1451.44%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 123.86%.  This results in a substantial divergence of 1327.58%.  The relative divergence of 56.49% indicates that AMD's performance sits relatively high within its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500. However, it's crucial to remember that this relative divergence doesn't imply consistent outperformance in the future.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high alpha values (significantly outperforming the market) across most periods, especially during 2016-2020.  However, Beta values are also high, indicating higher volatility than the market.  The recent period (2022-2024) shows negative CAGR, highlighting the risk associated with this stock.  The high market capitalization (Cap(B)) consistently increased throughout the years, indicative of the company's growth, though this is also correlated to higher risk levels.
