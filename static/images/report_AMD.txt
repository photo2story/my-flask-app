## AMD Stock Review: October 26, 2024

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) designs and manufactures microprocessors, including CPUs, GPUs, and related technologies.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), AMD has significantly outperformed.  The cumulative return for AMD is 1080.06%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 120.85%.  The difference in cumulative return is 959.2%, placing it at the 50.1 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  While this shows strong historical outperformance, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results. The high Alpha values in the provided table further highlight the significant outperformance against the benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $125.02
* **5-day Moving Average:** $127.87
* **20-day Moving Average:** $135.55
* **60-day Moving Average:** $148.69

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 31.37 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.69 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -1.4 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 2345.7% (This represents a significant potential outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, but this projection must be treated with caution given its highly optimistic nature)

The current price of $125.02, being below the moving averages and with a low RSI, doesn't suggest immediate strong upside potential, but the substantial oversold condition could suggest an opportunity. However, the negative PPO shows bearish momentum. The high expected return should be considered with extreme skepticism.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows mixed results:

* **Revenue:** Revenue growth has been inconsistent.  There's a noticeable drop in revenue from Q3 2024 to Q2 2024 followed by an increase in Q4 2024.  Overall, a positive trend isn't readily apparent.
* **EPS:** EPS fluctuated across quarters. A significant drop is visible from Q4 2024 to Q2 2024.  Overall trends aren't clear without more data.
* **Comparison:**  Without access to expected earnings, it's impossible to determine if results "beat" or "missed" expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but an overall upward trend. Profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 50% in the last two quarters, though they dip slightly in Q1 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing. Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates, suggesting varying profitability in different quarters.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has shown remarkable historical outperformance against the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, supported by technical indicators showing oversold conditions and bearish momentum.  Earnings data shows mixed results, with inconsistent revenue and EPS growth. The significantly high projected long-term return should be viewed with extreme caution due to its unrealistic nature. More data, particularly regarding expectations and recent news/analyst opinions, is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.  Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing and further research is crucial.
