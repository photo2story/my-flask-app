## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a multinational semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies.

The cumulative return of AMD is 1045.98%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 114.36%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 931.6%. This places AMD at the 48.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 throughout the years suggest that the outperformance is not explained by factors beyond market movement (Beta).  However, the high Beta values indicate AMD's high sensitivity to market fluctuations.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

**7. Summary:**

AMD has shown substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the past, evidenced by its significantly higher cumulative return. However, the recent price action indicates a possible short-term downtrend. Technical indicators point to an oversold condition, but bearish momentum is also present.  Recent earnings show mixed results, with some volatility in revenue and EPS but a notably strong performance in the latest quarter. While the projection of a very high long-term return is provided, it should be treated as highly speculative.  More information on recent market sentiment and analyst opinions is needed for a complete assessment.  The extremely high beta indicates high risk.
