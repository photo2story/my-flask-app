## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

AMD, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing CPUs, GPUs, and related technologies.  This report analyzes AMD's performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), assessing its recent price movements, financial indicators, and earnings.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMD's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500.

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 830.17%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 108.99%
* **Return Difference:** 721.18%  This indicates a substantial outperformance of AMD compared to the broader market. The relative divergence of 38.2%  places it within the upper range of historical performance relative to VOO,  though this is not a prediction of future performance.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility in AMD's performance over different periods, ranging from substantial gains to significant losses.  High alpha values in several periods suggest outperformance beyond what's explained by market beta, while high beta values reflect substantial market sensitivity.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 169.0% | 18.4% | 141.0% | 0.0 | 16.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 296.0% | 40.9% | 278.0% | 0.2 | 29.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 463.0% | 40.9% | 433.0% | 0.4 | 74.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 1029.0% | 40.9% | 1002.0% | 0.1 | 148.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 1370.0% | 9.6% | 1299.0% | 0.1 | 233.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -68.0% | 25.3% | -77.0% | 0.1 | 105.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 264.0% | 25.3% | 241.0% | 0.8 | 238.9 |
| 2022-2024  | -334.0% | 25.3% | -366.0% | 0.9 | 195.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 69.0% | 13.8% | 19.0% | 0.9 | 163.3 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $100.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $100.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $108.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $118.73

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price increase from the previous close (+$2.57) might be a temporary rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 29.16 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.89 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.5% (Indicates a recent short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1543.0% (This is a high projected return relative to the S&P 500, and should be considered with caution.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.   This high number warrants a deeper investigation into the assumptions used in this projection).
The recent price increase of 2.57, while significant in percentage terms, might not be enough to indicate a substantial reversal given the overall downtrend suggested by the moving averages and other indicators.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.48 | $6.82 B     |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.16 | $5.83 B     |
| 2024-05-01 | $0.08 | $5.47 B     |
| 2023-11-01 | $0.18 | $5.80 B     |
| 2024-10-30 | $0.18 | $5.80 B     |

There's a noticeable fluctuation in EPS and revenue across the quarters. The October 2024 data point appears duplicated.  A more detailed analysis would require verification of the data and examination of industry trends and company-specific factors affecting the figures.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $7.66B   | 50.69%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $6.82B   | 50.14%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.83B   | 49.08%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.47B   | 46.78%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.17B   | 47.20%       |

Revenue shows a generally increasing trend, with a notable increase in Q4 2024. Profit margins are high and relatively stable.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $57.57    | 0.84    |
| 2024-09-30 | $56.98    | 1.35    |
| 2024-06-30 | $56.54    | 0.47    |
| 2024-03-31 | $56.20    | 0.22    |
| 2023-12-31 | $55.89    | 1.19    |

Equity is gradually increasing, while ROE fluctuates.  Further analysis would be needed to understand the underlying drivers of these fluctuations.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD shows significant long-term growth potential, considerably outperforming the S&P 500. However, the recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, indicated by the price being below its moving averages and bearish technical indicators.  The high projected future return should be treated with skepticism unless fully justified.  Earnings show some volatility, but revenue is generally increasing, and profit margins are strong.  While the current financial data looks healthy, further investigation is needed to fully understand the underlying drivers of AMD's performance and to validate the exceptionally high projected long-term returns.  Investors should conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.  This report provides a snapshot of the data, and not financial advice.
