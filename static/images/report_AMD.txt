## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

AMD, a leading designer and manufacturer of computing and graphics products, has shown significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. However, recent price action suggests a potential slowdown, warranting further investigation into its underlying fundamentals and market sentiment.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

AMD's cumulative return of 673.84% dramatically outperforms the S&P 500's 76.18%.  The difference (597.7%) places AMD at the 34.9th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on provided data (max: 1774.8, min: -32.1).  This suggests a historically strong performance relative to the market, although recent volatility needs to be considered.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high alpha values (above 0.3, except for 2015-2017 and the most recent years which are projected) indicating AMD significantly outperformed the market during the periods analyzed.  The beta values are high, indicating high volatility and a strong correlation with the overall market. The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects AMD's growth. However, the projected negative CAGR for 2022-2025 indicates concern for future performance.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

AMD's closing price is $87.5, down $0.89 from the previous close ($88.29).  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($91.80), 20-day ($97.48), and 60-day ($104.72) moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  This confirms the observation in the previous section regarding potential slowdown.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244, suggesting a low-medium risk level.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.198, below 50, indicating bearish momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.4083, further supporting the bearish trend.
* **Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (no change, possibly hinting at a continued trend, need longer-term data to support this claim).
* **Expected Return:** 1868.4% over the long term (2+ years) vs. S&P 500 â€“ This appears unusually high and requires scrutiny of the methodology used to calculate this figure.  Given the negative projected CAGR from the previous analysis, this figure should be considered unreliable.
* **Price Change:** The negative change of -$0.89 is relatively small, not indicating a significant drop. A deeper dive is needed to confirm whether it represents a minor correction or the beginning of a longer trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Revenue has generally increased, yet EPS fluctuates.  The data needs further analysis to determine the underlying reasons behind earnings volatility.  A deeper dive into profitability and cost structure is necessary.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high alpha and substantial growth. However, recent price action and projected negative CAGR raise concerns.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity. While financial statements reveal healthy revenue growth and strong profit margins,  the fluctuating EPS and ROE warrant a deeper investigation into the company's operational efficiency and future growth prospects. The extremely high projected long-term return should be treated with skepticism. Further analysis, including a review of industry trends, competitive landscape, and future product pipeline, is essential to form a comprehensive investment opinion.  The provided data suggests a need for caution and further due diligence before making any investment decisions.  Independent verification of the provided data and projections is strongly recommended.
