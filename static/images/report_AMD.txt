## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a multinational semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, and other related technologies.

The cumulative return of AMD is 1095.82%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.78%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 974.04%.  The provided relative divergence of 50.9% indicates AMD's performance is in the upper half of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to remember that this is relative to its own historical volatility against the S&P 500 and not an absolute measure of outperformance.

The provided CAGR data shows extremely high growth rates between 2015 and 2021, followed by significant decline in 2022-2024.  The consistently high Beta values (16-29) indicate significant sensitivity to overall market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $126.69
* **Last Market Price:** $124.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $128.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $136.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $149.22

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The difference between the closing price and last market price is small and doesn't indicate a significant immediate price movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 29.84 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.63 –  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** -2.0 –  This indicates a recent short-term downward trend relative to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 2307.6% – This exceptionally high figure represents the projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500 given consistent investment.  It should be viewed with caution and skepticism due to the inherent volatility exhibited in prior years.  Such high projected returns are unlikely and should not be considered a guaranteed outcome. The extremely high value suggests underlying assumptions possibly need review.

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has generally increased quarter-over-quarter, with a notable peak in Q3 2024 at $6.82B. However, there are some fluctuations.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has historically demonstrated significant growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over various periods. However, the recent downward trend (indicated by moving averages and PPO) and high volatility are major concerns.  The extremely high projected long-term return needs significant scrutiny and should not be considered reliable. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, a potential rebound should be considered in context with other indicators and potential market factors. Fundamental analysis reveals considerable revenue growth and generally high profit margins.  However, earnings data exhibits considerable quarter-to-quarter variability.
