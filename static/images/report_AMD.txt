## AMD Stock Review: October 26, 2024

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) designs and manufactures microprocessors, including CPUs, GPUs, and embedded processors.  The cumulative return of AMD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 1208.14% for AMD versus 122.19% for VOO.  This results in a return difference of 1086.0 percentage points on the last day of the provided data.  The relative divergence of 56.5% indicates AMD's performance has been substantially above VOO historically, based on the provided range.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high alpha values (significantly outperforming the market) except for the 2020-2022 period, where it underperformed.  The beta values indicate varying levels of market sensitivity.  Note that the provided alphas are questionable as they are all 0.0.  More reliable data would be needed to interpret them correctly.  Cap(B) demonstrates consistent growth in market capitalization.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $138.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $141.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $140.20
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $151.60

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 56.54 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.57 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +0.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 2071.2% (Significantly higher than S&P 500; however, this requires confirmation through robust financial modelling, and is potentially unrealistic without further information)


The current price of $138.59 does not indicate a dramatic price movement (neither a sharp uptrend nor a steep decline) based on the provided moving averages.  The high expected return figure needs further context and validation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly results show a significant increase in revenue and EPS compared to the previous quarters of 2024.  The largest quarter in revenue and EPS is reported in 2024-10-30.

* **Revenue Growth:**  Generally increasing, with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.
* **EPS Trends:**  Similarly increasing, indicating strong profitability.  There is a notably higher EPS in the most recent quarter compared to previous quarters.
* **Beats or Misses:** No expectations are provided, so we cannot determine beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a consistent growth trend, with a slight dip in Q2 2024 before a sharp increase in Q3 2024. Profit margins are strong and relatively stable, exhibiting a small overall upward trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing. ROE shows fluctuations but generally indicates a positive trend in profitability, although it's relatively low considering the substantial increase in revenue and profits.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent issues are explicitly provided in the prompt.  To provide a comprehensive analysis, information about recent earnings announcements (beyond the provided numbers), market outlook, and analyst opinions would be necessary.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD shows exceptionally strong performance compared to the S&P 500, with significantly higher returns. The recent earnings demonstrate robust growth in revenue and EPS.  However, the long-term expected return of 2071.2% requires critical evaluation and additional supporting evidence to be considered reliable.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downtrend, although the RSI isn't definitively bearish. More context around news and analyst opinions, along with verified Alpha and Beta data would enhance the completeness of this review.  The provided financial data shows positive trends in revenue, profit margin, and equity, but ROE needs further investigation.
