| 2023-2025  | 212.0% | 82.4% | 146.0% | 0.6  | 354.1  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows strong growth in earlier periods, followed by significant declines and a recent rebound. High volatility is evident.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating substantial potential losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** Generally positive (except during down years), signifying outperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). High Alpha indicates that the investment has outperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Low Beta values (0 to 0.6) suggest that AMD's price is less sensitive to the movements of the broader market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in billions, illustrating significant growth in the company's value over time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 217.53
*   **Previous Close:** 214.24
*   **Change:** 1.54
*   **5-day SMA:** 211.35
*   **20-day SMA:** 234.56
*   **60-day SMA:** 208.47

**Analysis:**

The current price is above the 5-day and 60-day SMAs, but below the 20-day SMA. This suggests a recent downtrend as the shorter-term average is below the longer-term average. The positive change from the previous close might indicate a short-term rebound, but the overall trend needs further monitoring.

**3) Index Indicators and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, Expected_Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 43.59 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -2.06 (Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -16.4 (Negative Trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 273.0%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests that from a broader market perspective, investment is recommended, BUT you need to consider the risks below:
*   The RSI is near the oversold threshold (30), indicating the stock may be undervalued.
*   The negative PPO suggests a bearish trend in the short-term momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying based on its risk assessment.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms a short-term downward trend.
*   The high expected return suggests potential for significant gains if held long-term. However, given the volatility and recent trends, this comes with considerable risk.
*   The recent price change of 1.54 highlights the stock's recent fluctuations.
