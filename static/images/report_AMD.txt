**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Compound Annual Growth Rate.  High values indicate strong growth over the specified period.  Note the recent negative CAGR, suggesting recent underperformance.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown. Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. Higher MDD implies higher risk.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the excess return of the investment relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500). High positive alpha is desirable. Recent negative alpha indicates underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the market.  A beta close to 1 suggests the investment moves in line with the market. Values significantly above 1 indicate higher volatility.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **5-day Moving Average:** 159.22
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 160.47
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 160.51

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), which *could* be interpreted as a short-term bearish signal. The positive change from the previous close suggests a potential rebound, but further price action is needed to confirm a trend reversal.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3367 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 42.54 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** -0.1 (Short-term decrease in relative performance compared to the benchmark)
*   **Expected Return:** 1194.9% (Long-term, S&P 500-relative excess return projection)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a low-risk environment.
*   The RSI is neutral.
*   The negative PPO and recent relative deviation change suggest short-term weakness.
*   The Hybrid Signal indicates a cautious stance, recommending holding a significant cash position and a slight reduction in holdings.
