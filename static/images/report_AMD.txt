2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's an analysis of AMD based on the provided data.

**1) Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a global semiconductor company focusing on CPUs and GPUs for various markets.
*   **Return Performance:** AMD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined.  Its cumulative return is 481.49% compared to VOO's 99.09%.
*   **Divergence:** The divergence between AMD and VOO is currently 382.4. The relative divergence of 55.7 indicates that the current divergence is in the middle of its historical range.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   AMD has generated substantial alpha (excess return above the market) in most periods.
    *   Beta values are generally low (mostly below 0.5), indicating AMD's price movements are not as sensitive to the broader market's movements.
    *   CAGR fluctuated between 250.0% (2017-2019) and -231.0% (2022-2024)
    *   MDD remained high (over 70%) throughout the periods.
    *   The 'Cap' figure represents a capitalization or investment amount (expressed in Billions). It suggests the size of the investment or capital being managed or considered.
    *   The negative Alpha for recent years suggests AMD underperformed relative to what its beta would predict.

**Simple Analysis:** AMD has shown strong potential for excess returns compared to the market (S&P500), especially from 2017-2021. However, its recent decline in performance should be carefully investigated along with the high MDD.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** $201.06
*   **Recent Performance:** Up $1.49 from the previous close.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: $205.34
    *   20-day SMA: $213.0384
    *   60-day SMA: $221.6044

**Simple Analysis:** The price is below all three moving averages, which *could* indicate a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, reinforcing this idea.
**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment) - Suggests a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** 29.07 - Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30).
*   **PPO:** -0.7986 - Negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) - A buy signal based on the MRI and a safe, potentially conservative, investment approach.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -7.4 (-): 단기하락 - Indicates a recent decrease in relative divergence, suggesting a short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** 292.5% - This is a very high expected return compared to S&P 500, assuming a long-term investment.

**Simple Analysis:** While the MRI suggests a medium investment, the RSI suggests the stock may be oversold and could be due for a rebound. The negative PPO and recent divergence change indicate some short-term weakness.  The extremely high expected return should be viewed cautiously and investigated further.

    *   Strong historical performance and significant alpha generation.
    *   Positive analyst consensus with substantial upside potential.
    *   Increasing revenue, profit margins, and equity.
    *   Recent news suggests innovation with upcoming products.
    *   The stock appears oversold (RSI).

*   **Negatives/Concerns:**
    *   Recent underperformance compared to the market.
    *   Short-term downtrend indicated by moving averages.
    *   Competition in the AI chip market.
    *   Some analyst downgrades and a wide range in target prices.
    *   High MDD

**Overall:** AMD presents a mixed picture. It has a history of high growth and outperformance, but recent performance suggests caution. The analyst consensus and financial data are positive, but the short-term technicals are weak. The very high expected return is unusual and requires further investigation. The news is mixed, with positive innovation trends offset by competitive concerns. AMD could be a good long-term investment, but investors should be aware of the potential risks and uncertainties. It may be prudent to wait for confirmation of a rebound before establishing a position.
