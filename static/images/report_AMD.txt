## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, and related technologies.  The cumulative return of AMD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, AMD's cumulative return is 1482.49%, while VOO's is 125.68%. This represents a difference of 1356.81%, placing AMD's performance at the 57.7th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  The substantial outperformance is visually clear in the provided data's large positive Alpha values over multiple periods.  However, the relative strength has weakened significantly in the most recent year (2022-2024) with a negative return.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided table shows a consistently high Alpha, indicating significant outperformance compared to the benchmark (S&P 500), particularly in the 2016-2021 period.  The Beta is also volatile and quite high, signifying significantly higher risk than the market.  The high Beta reflects AMD's sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The recent negative CAGR and negative Alpha are noteworthy and warrant further investigation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $137.6
* **5-day Moving Average:** $137.93
* **20-day Moving Average:** $145.78
* **60-day Moving Average:** $152.23

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.39 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
