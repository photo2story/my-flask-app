*   **Return Rate:**
    *   AMD Cumulative Return: 335.70%

    | 2019-2021  | 271.0%  | 42.1% | 228.0%  | 1.4  | 234.3  |

    | 2023-2025  | 139.0%  | 70.2% | 77.0%  | 2.1  | 348.7  |

*   **Analysis of Alpha/Beta:**
    *   **CAGR:**  Shows significant growth potential, albeit volatile.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates high risk, especially in earlier periods. Even in recent periods, drawdowns are substantial, suggesting significant price swings.
    *   **Alpha:** Consistently positive Alpha in profitable periods demonstrates AMD's ability to generate returns above what would be expected based on market movements. Recent negative Alpha values highlight periods of significant underperformance relative to the market.
    *   **Beta:**  A Beta consistently above 1 indicates that AMD is more volatile than the overall market (S&P 500).  A Beta around 2 suggests the stock's price tends to move twice as much as the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 214.16
*   **Previous Close:** 215.34

*   **5-day SMA:** 215.03
*   **20-day SMA:** 214.11
*   **60-day SMA:** 227.87

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day SMAs but significantly below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term sideways trend with potential downward momentum if the price continues to stay below the longer-term moving average. The small negative change from the previous close indicates a slight recent dip.
