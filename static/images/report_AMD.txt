## AMD Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a multinational semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies.

The cumulative return of AMD is 1105.73%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.40%.  The difference in cumulative return between AMD and VOO as of the last day in the provided data is 985.3 percentage points.  The provided relative divergence of 51.5% indicates AMD's performance is in the upper portion of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR data shows extremely high growth in several periods, followed by significant decline.  This underscores high volatility.  The Beta consistently exceeds 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $127.74 (Last Market: $130.40)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $136.51
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $138.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $150.84

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The difference between the last market price and closing price may indicate a slight decline after market close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.16 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.30 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.7% (Indicates a recent short-term decline)

The RSI below 30 suggests the stock may be oversold. However, the negative PPO and the recent decline in relative divergence suggest bearish momentum.  The provided expected return of 2275.1% over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, significantly exceeding the S&P 500, should be viewed with extreme caution given the inherent volatility of AMD and the lack of detail on the methodology used to arrive at this figure.  High expected returns often correspond to high risk. The provided information does not give sufficient detail to support this estimate.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS.  While revenue generally increased quarter over quarter (with one exception), EPS shows significant variability. There is insufficient information to assess whether these numbers beat or missed expectations.

* **Revenue Growth:** Shows some growth, but fluctuates significantly quarter to quarter.  Further analysis would be needed to determine a definitive trend.
* **EPS Trends:**  Highly volatile, with significant jumps and drops in EPS between quarters.
* **Beats/Misses:** Cannot be determined without expectation data.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue growth is inconsistent. Profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 50%, although there is a slight dip in Q1 2024.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown consistent growth. ROE is highly volatile, indicating significant swings in profitability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent issues are provided in the given data.  To provide a complete analysis, information regarding recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is needed.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has shown exceptional long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the extreme volatility inherent in its performance. The recent price action indicates a downtrend, supported by bearish technical indicators.  While the company shows periods of strong revenue and profit margin growth, these are punctuated by periods of significant decline.  The provided expected return is exceptionally high and requires further justification. More information on recent news, analyst opinions, and earnings expectations is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The high volatility and unpredictable nature of the stock suggest this investment is suitable only for those with a high tolerance for risk.
