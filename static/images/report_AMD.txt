The difference in cumulative return on the last day is 788.1, placing it at the 41.5th percentile of the historical range (max: 1950.2, min: -37.8).

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $108.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $112.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $113.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $122.55

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change (-$2.46) indicates a recent drop.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (40.03):**  Approaching oversold territory (generally considered below 30), suggesting potential for a price bounce. However, it's not decisively oversold.
* **PPO (0.14):** A positive value indicates that the 12-period moving average is above the 26-period moving average, implying a bullish momentum.  However, the value is relatively low, suggesting the bullish signal is weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-2.1):** Shows a recent short-term bearish trend.  Combined with the price decline, this strengthens the negative short-term outlook.
* **Expected Return (1349.5%):** This extremely high expected return, relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), highlights the potential for significant outperformance, but also reflects the considerable risk inherent in such a volatile investment.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date        | EPS  | Revenue     |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.48 | $6.82B      |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.16 | $5.83B      |

| 2024-10-30 | $0.18 | $5.80B      | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings show some volatility, with a significant jump in EPS in the October 2024 quarter. Revenue is generally increasing, though not consistently. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the reasons behind this volatility and whether it reflects underlying business trends or other factors.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity  | ROE   |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| 2024-12-31 | $57.57B | 0.84% |
| 2024-09-30 | $56.98B | 1.35% |

| 2023-12-31 | $55.89B | 1.19% |

Equity is growing, but ROE is volatile, suggesting varying levels of profitability on the company's invested capital.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMD shows a history of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, although this performance has been highly volatile. Current indicators (RSI, moving averages) suggest a potential short-term bearish trend, but the high expected long-term return and the positive aspects of the financial statements should be carefully considered alongside the risk.  Further investigation is warranted to fully understand the drivers of the earnings volatility and the relatively low ROE despite strong profit margins.  The high beta suggests that AMD is a high-risk, high-reward investment, suitable only for investors with a high tolerance for volatility and a long-term investment horizon. The duplicate earnings entry needs clarification.  Before making any investment decisions, conduct thorough due diligence and consider consulting with a financial advisor.
