    *   **Alpha:** Consistently positive during growth periods, indicating outperformance relative to a benchmark. Negative alpha during downturns.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** \$217.60

*   **5-day SMA:** 216.16
*   **20-day SMA:** 228.44
*   **60-day SMA:** 211.64

    *   **Analysis:**  The current price is below the 20-day SMA but above the 60-day SMA. The 5-day SMA is also below the current price. This suggests a recent upward trend. However, the price needs to break above the 20-day SMA to confirm a stronger bullish signal.

*   **PPO:** -1.08 - Shows the percentage difference between a 26-period and 12-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). A negative PPO suggests the short-term EMA is below the long-term EMA, indicating a downtrend, but it's not severely negative.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2717 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-23) - The "Very Safe" label is misleading, as it conflicts with the actual MRI value. This signal suggests to buy fully.
