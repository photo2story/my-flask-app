**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) designs and manufactures microprocessors, including CPUs and GPUs.

However, 2022-2025 shows negative CAGR, illustrating volatility. The consistently low Beta values initially suggest relatively low market sensitivity, while later data showcases a higher beta, signifying greater market correlation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has shown remarkable growth in the past, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent price action indicates a considerable downturn. While fundamental data (revenue and profit margins) remain strong, the recent earnings volatility and negative price momentum warrant caution. The high expected return should be treated with skepticism due to recent sharp price decline and should be reevaluated based on updated market conditions and a careful assessment of the methodology used.  Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the recent price drop and to assess the long-term outlook.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, which could signal a potential bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish in the short term. Before any investment decisions, a comprehensive analysis incorporating updated market data, news, and industry trends is crucial. The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings) need clarification.
