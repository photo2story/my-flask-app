## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies.  The cumulative return of AMD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, AMD's cumulative return is 1497.79%, while VOO's is 124.78%.  The difference is 1373.01%, placing it at the 58.37th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (max difference: 2380.93%, min difference: -39.95%).  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the broader market over the observed period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $138.93 (Last Market: $138.38)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $139.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $147.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.62

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates relatively recent price stability before the drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 24.51 -  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity for some investors. However, it's crucial to consider other factors as well.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.69 -  Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** -9.59% - Shows a recent decline in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 227.29% -  This implies a substantial potential for outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. This number should be treated with caution; it's just a projection and actual returns may vary significantly.  The recent drop in price might affect this projection.  The $138.38 last market price doesn't suggest a significant immediate upswing or downswing based solely on this data.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows a mixed bag.  Revenue has generally been increasing, however, the most recent quarter (2024-10-30) shows a significant jump in EPS while revenue only slightly exceeds the preceding quarters. The previous quarter's EPS of 0.16 is significantly lower than the 0.48 in the most recent quarter.  Further investigation into the underlying drivers is necessary to understand this fluctuation.  Analysis of the expected earnings versus actuals for the latest quarter would provide a better evaluation of management's guidance and expectations.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has shown relatively consistent growth, but profit margins have fluctuated, indicating some volatility in profitability.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Return on Equity (ROE) is low and inconsistent, suggesting concerns about the efficiency of capital utilization. This needs further investigation.


**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*  *(This section requires access to real-time news sources such as Shacknews and Finbold.  Please provide news articles from the past two days for a comprehensive analysis.)*  A thorough review of recent news, including earnings calls, analyst ratings, and market outlooks, is crucial for a complete picture.  This information should be incorporated into the analysis to assess any recent impacting events.


**8. Overall Summary:**

AMD shows a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend.  The high expected return suggests long-term potential, but this needs to be carefully weighed against the risks.  The mixed bag of financial results and the low and inconsistent ROE raise some concerns.  A thorough analysis of recent news and earnings reports (including a comparison of estimates versus actuals) is critical to properly assess the current situation and future outlook.  The oversold RSI might signal a buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance, but only after a complete risk assessment.
