## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

AMD, a leading designer and manufacturer of microprocessors, has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  However, recent performance has been volatile, warranting a closer examination of its financial health and market positioning.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 927.38%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 120.05%
* **Return Difference:** 807.33% (Significantly higher than the S&P 500)
* **Relative Divergence:** 42.5% (Indicates AMD's performance is in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500)


The provided Alpha and Beta data shows high volatility and significant outperformance in some periods, followed by substantial underperformance in others.  The high Beta values (significantly above 1) highlight AMD's sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The high alpha values suggest that AMD's returns have frequently outperformed the market's expectation. However, the negative CAGR in 2022-2024 is concerning.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 169.0% | 18.4% | 141.0% | 0.0 | 16.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 296.0% | 40.9% | 278.0% | 0.2 | 29.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 463.0% | 40.9% | 433.0% | 0.4 | 74.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 1029.0% | 40.9% | 1002.0% | 0.1 | 148.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 1370.0% | 9.6% | 1299.0% | 0.1 | 233.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -68.0% | 25.3% | -77.0% | 0.1 | 105.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 264.0% | 25.3% | 241.0% | 0.8 | 238.9 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $110.48
* **5-day Moving Average:** $111.94
* **20-day Moving Average:** $117.03
* **60-day Moving Average:** $126.53

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase (2.71%) from the previous close might be a temporary rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 35.40 (Below 50, indicating bearish sentiment)
* **PPO:** -0.53 (Negative value suggests a bearish trend)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.9 (Short-term bearish)

The combination of low RSI and negative PPO, along with the negative relative divergence change, reinforces the bearish signal. The recent price increase should be viewed cautiously within this context.  The expected return of 1295% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 suggests significant upside potential, though it carries considerable risk given the volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.48  | $6.82 B     |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.16  | $5.83 B     |

| 2024-10-30 | $0.18  | $5.80 B     | *(Note: Duplicate entry.  Possible data error.)*


Revenue shows a generally upward trend, though EPS is highly volatile. The duplicate entry needs clarification. Further investigation into the accuracy of the data is recommended.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD's long-term performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500, demonstrating substantial growth potential. However, the recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  The high volatility and beta highlight the inherent risk associated with this investment.  While long-term projections suggest significant potential returns, investors should carefully consider the inherent risk and be prepared for considerable price swings.  Further due diligence is necessary to verify the data accuracy and assess the impact of potential macroeconomic factors.  The recent earnings data, while generally positive in terms of revenue growth, requires clarification due to a duplicate entry and should be analyzed more deeply alongside industry trends.
