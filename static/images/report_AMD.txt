## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

AMD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for AMD is 1037.88%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 118.37%.  This represents a substantial difference of **919.5 percentage points**.  The provided relative divergence of 48.2% indicates that AMD's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Company Overview:** Advanced Micro Devices Inc. designs and manufactures microprocessors and related technologies for the computing and graphics markets.

**CAGR, MDD, Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile performance for AMD across different timeframes.  While exhibiting periods of extremely high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR),  the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) also reveals significant risk. The consistently near-zero Alpha suggests its performance is largely correlated to the market (as expected given the high Beta values in most years),  except for periods of extreme outperformance.  Noteworthy is the exceptionally high CAGR in 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 and significantly negative returns in 2020-2022 and 2022-2024 indicating cyclical trends.  The Beta values are consistently high indicating high volatility correlated to the market, though the data seems incomplete.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $121.46
* **5-day Moving Average:** $118.65
* **20-day Moving Average:** $121.90
* **60-day Moving Average:** $134.91

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and considerably below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  However, the recent increase in price of $2.55 from the previous close indicates an upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.27 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to the oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.22 – A positive value indicates upward momentum, though relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.3 – Shows a short-term upward trend in relative divergence.
* **Expected Return:** 1044.1% – This exceptionally high expected return (over a long term) needs careful consideration, especially given the inherent volatility. It is significantly higher than VOO.


The recent price change of $2.55 represents a relatively small percentage jump. It's not substantial enough to be defined as a "sharp rebound".


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating revenue and earnings per share (EPS).  There's no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent from this limited dataset, requiring more data for a thorough analysis. Note that there are duplicate entries for Oct 30th, 2024.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.48  | $6.82B       |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.16  | $5.83B       |
| 2024-05-01 | $0.08  | $5.47B       |
| 2023-11-01 | $0.18  | $5.80B       |
| 2024-10-30 | $0.18  | $5.80B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows relatively stable revenue growth and high profit margins. Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates, but generally remains low.  Further analysis is needed to understand these trends and their implications.  The data does not fully support a strong case for the exceptionally high projected return.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $6.82B   | 50.14%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.83B   | 49.08%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.47B   | 46.78%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.17B   | 47.20%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.80B   | 47.36%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE    |
|------------|----------|--------|
| 2024-09-30 | $56.98B  | 1.35%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $56.54B  | 0.47%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $56.20B  | 0.22%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $55.89B  | 1.19%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $54.97B  | 0.54%  |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD's past performance shows remarkable growth, significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  However, this growth has been highly volatile, characterized by substantial drawdowns. The high projected return requires further investigation of the underlying assumptions. The current price is below recent moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term correction. While the financial data shows healthy profitability, the ROE is relatively low, requiring additional context for interpretation.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with AMD's stock before making any investment decisions.  The exceptionally high expected return should be treated with caution and further due diligence should be undertaken before committing to a long-term investment.  The data provided is insufficient to fully justify the claimed expected return.  A more thorough analysis incorporating a wider range of financial metrics and market conditions is necessary.
