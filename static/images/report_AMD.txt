**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Demonstrates periods of significant growth (e.g., 2019-2021) followed by periods of decline (e.g., 2022-2024).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Shows the maximum peak-to-trough decline during each period. The high MDD values suggest AMD can be volatile.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently positive alpha in most periods indicates AMD has generally outperformed its benchmark (risk-adjusted). However, negative alpha in recent periods shows underperformance.
*   **Beta:** The beta values generally indicate AMD's price is more volatile than the market (beta > 1) or moves similarly to the market (beta close to 1).  Negative beta from 2015-2017 indicates AMD moved in the opposite direction of the market during that time.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization.

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 95.82
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 99.97

**Analysis:** AMD's current price is above all its short-term and medium-term moving averages, indicating a short-term bullish trend. The significant positive change from the previous close suggests a strong upward movement.

**Analysis:**
