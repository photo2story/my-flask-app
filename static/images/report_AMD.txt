## AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

AMD, a leading designer and manufacturer of computing and graphics solutions, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) based on the provided data.  The cumulative return of AMD is drastically higher than VOO.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 962.72%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 122.48%
* **Return Difference:** 840.2%  (This indicates AMD significantly outperformed the S&P 500.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 44.2% (This places AMD's performance in the upper quartile relative to its historical performance compared to VOO.  It doesn't imply consistent outperformance going forward.)

The Alpha and Beta analysis show high alpha values, especially in recent years, indicating significant outperformance relative to the market (Beta).  However, the high Beta also suggests significant market sensitivity. The high volatility is also reflected in the large swings in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  Noteworthy is the significant negative return from 2022-2024.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2015-2017  | 169.0% | 18.4% | 141.0% | 0.0 | 16.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 296.0% | 40.9% | 278.0% | 0.2 | 29.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 463.0% | 40.9% | 433.0% | 0.4 | 74.3 |

| 2020-2022  | -68.0% | 25.3% | -77.0% | 0.1 | 105.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 264.0% | 25.3% | 241.0% | 0.8 | 238.9 |
| 2022-2024  | -334.0% | 25.3% | -366.0% | 0.9 | 195.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $114.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $112.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $115.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $124.30

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price change shows a small increase.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 50.17 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold.)
* **PPO:** 0.29 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.7 (Indicates short-term upward trend)

The price increase of $1.04 from the previous close is not dramatic enough to indicate a significant jump (or drop).  The relatively neutral RSI and positive PPO suggest a balanced market sentiment with some bullish momentum. The high expected return of 1215.5% is significant but must be viewed cautiously as this projection is highly uncertain.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has demonstrated remarkable growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  However, this outperformance has been volatile, with periods of substantial gains and losses.  The high Beta indicates sensitivity to market fluctuations.  While recent financial statements show strong revenue and profit margins, the fluctuating EPS and the need for clarification on duplicate data points necessitate further investigation.  The high projected long-term return should be treated with caution due to inherent uncertainties in such projections.  A comprehensive risk assessment, considering the high volatility and market sensitivity, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of current performance and identify potential risks.
