## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, and related technologies.

AMD's cumulative return (1097.89%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (120.91%). The difference is 977.0%, placing it at the 51st percentile of its historical relative performance range (max: 1950.4, min: -37.8).  This indicates strong outperformance relative to the broader market, although not at its historical peak.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $126.91
* **5-day Moving Average:** $129.25
* **20-day Moving Average:** $136.66
* **60-day Moving Average:** $149.70

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.09):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO (-0.58):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-5.5%):** Shows a recent decline in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (2301.6%):**  A projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance of the S&P 500.  This extremely high figure requires careful consideration, as itâ€™s based on past performance which is not necessarily indicative of future results.  The current price of $126.91, below its moving averages, doesn't currently reflect this expectation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture:

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue generally increased from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024, peaking at $6.82B before a slight decrease.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS fluctuated significantly. Q3 2024 shows a notable increase compared to the previous quarter (Q2 2024).
* **Comparison:** There is no information provided to compare reported earnings against expectations, precluding an analysis of beats or misses.  We only have reported results.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows growth, but the profit margin fluctuated between 46.78% and 50.14% over the reported quarters. The fluctuations do not suggest a clear upward or downward trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows steady growth.  Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile, suggesting inconsistent profitability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news, market outlook information, or analyst opinions are provided.  Therefore, no analysis can be performed on this aspect.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, the recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend. The stock is currently trading below its moving averages, and while the RSI indicates potential oversold conditions, the negative PPO points to continued bearish momentum.  Recent earnings data shows revenue growth but inconsistent profitability.  The extraordinarily high projected long-term return needs to be interpreted cautiously as it's solely based on historical data.  Further investigation is needed regarding analyst opinions and market outlook to have a complete picture.  The absence of this information is a major limitation in this analysis.
