## Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

AMD, a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, graphics processing units, and related technologies, shows significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The substantial difference warrants a deeper investigation into the drivers of this performance.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 962.72%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 122.48%
* **Return Difference:** 840.2%  (This is the raw difference.  The relative divergence of 44.2% indicates AMD's performance is significantly higher than VOO, placing it in the upper quartile of historical performance relative to VOO.)
* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha and beta values suggest AMD's performance has significantly outperformed the market (high alpha values), while exhibiting high volatility (high beta values, particularly in some periods).  This high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  Note that the periods used are rolling 2 year periods.  The high volatility is expected for high-growth technology companies.

*There appears to be a duplicate entry for October 30th, 2024. This needs clarification.*  Revenue shows a general upward trend, with EPS fluctuating.  A more detailed analysis requires additional financial data.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This data is crucial for evaluating AMD's profitability and financial health.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

AMD has demonstrated exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500 over the observed period.  However, this performance has been accompanied by high volatility.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook, but the absence of crucial financial information (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) prevents a complete assessment of AMD's financial health and sustainability.  The projected 1215.5% return needs more context and justification.  Further investigation into the methodology used to generate the alpha/beta values and the expected return is necessary before drawing definitive conclusions.  The high volatility and market sensitivity (high Beta) should be considered by investors.  Additional financial data is required for a more thorough and robust analysis.
