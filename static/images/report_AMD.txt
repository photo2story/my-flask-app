## AMD Stock Report: October 26, 2024

**1. Performance Overview & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, and related technologies.

The cumulative return of AMD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last day of the provided data is 1347.5 percentage points (1477.605 - 130.059 = 1347.546). The relative divergence of 57.3% indicates that AMD's performance has been substantially better than the S&P 500 over the period considered, placing it in the higher percentile of past performance relative to the S&P 500.  Note that the relative divergence is not a prediction of future outperformance.  The historical data shows high volatility, with CAGR ranging from -168% to 1650% depending on the period examined.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $137.18
* **5-day Moving Average:** $138.12
* **20-day Moving Average:** $140.76
* **60-day Moving Average:** $151.74

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.36 – This indicates that the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.07 – A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, albeit weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (-) –  Indicates a recent downward trend in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  The "NaN" suggests missing data in the calculation.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 2497.4% –  This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  This high figure should be treated with caution given the high volatility observed in historical data and the inherent uncertainty in long-term projections.  A 2497.4% return is extremely high and unlikely to be realized.

The closing price of $137.2 does not suggest a dramatic upward or downward event given the context of the data provided. However, its positioning below the moving averages does suggest caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-30).  Analyzing the unique data points reveals:

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has generally increased over the reported quarters, although there is some fluctuation.  The most recent quarter shows the highest revenue at $6.82B.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS increased significantly from Q1 2024 ($0.08) to Q3 2024 ($0.48), suggesting strong performance in recent quarters.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have generally been healthy and fluctuate around 50%, showing some quarter-to-quarter variability.

**Note:**  A more comprehensive analysis would require examining the full range of earnings reports and comparing actual results to analyst expectations. The provided data alone doesn't allow for a thorough assessment of beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a consistent upward trend, with the exception of a slight dip in Q2 2024.  Profit margins are generally high and remain relatively stable around 47-50%.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has steadily increased, suggesting a strong financial position.  ROE (Return on Equity) shows significant fluctuations, implying variability in profitability.  This is likely due to the high volatility and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis Summary:**

AMD shows a strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, although this has been highly volatile.
