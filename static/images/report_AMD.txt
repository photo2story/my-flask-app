2024-12-25 - Analysis Report
## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

AMD's cumulative return (1076.09%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (117.56%) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is 958.5 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 50.1% indicates that AMD's performance, relative to its historical volatility compared to the S&P 500, sits at the 50th percentile.  This suggests strong outperformance but also highlights considerable volatility.

**Company Overview:** Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is a multinational semiconductor company manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data showcases AMD's high growth potential (CAGR consistently above 100% in several periods) but also significant volatility, demonstrated by substantial maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The beta values fluctuate, indicating varying sensitivities to overall market movements.  Alpha values of 0.0 suggest performance in line with the benchmark after adjusting for risk.  However, this seems unlikely given the high CAGR values.  It is crucial to review the methodology and assumptions used to calculate these Alpha and Beta values.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $124.60
* **Last Market Price:** $126.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $121.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $132.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $145.89

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The last market price of $126.29 reflects a slight uptick compared to the closing price and indicates some potential short-term recovery.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (27.46):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.655):** Shows a negative momentum, aligning with the downtrend observed in the moving averages.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-0.8):** Confirms the short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2349.4%):** This exceptionally high figure suggests a potential for significant long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over two or more years.  However,  it's crucial to understand the model used to arrive at this expectation and assess its validity given the historical volatility of AMD. The significant difference between the closing price and Last Market price needs investigation to assess for any significant market events between the recording times.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

AMD's revenue shows quarter-over-quarter fluctuations.  While there was a strong increase in revenue from Q1 2024 ($5.47B) to Q3 2024 ($6.82B), it is notable that revenues were lower in Q2 2024 ($5.83B) than in Q4 2023 ($6.17B).  EPS also fluctuates, with a significant increase from $0.08 in Q1 2024 to $0.48 in Q3 2024.  There is duplication of the 2024-10-30 data point, which should be clarified.  Further details on earnings expectations are needed for a comprehensive "beats" or "misses" analysis.  The data alone doesn't reveal any obvious consistent upward or downward trends, suggesting volatility in performance.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue has shown growth in several quarters, but recent quarterly data shows some fluctuations. Profit margins are generally high but exhibit some quarter-to-quarter variation.  Equity is consistently increasing, but ROE is quite volatile, indicating fluctuating profitability.  More context on industry benchmarks for profit margins and ROE is needed for a complete assessment.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), the current market outlook relevant to AMD, and analyst opinions and performance highlights.  Without this information, a comprehensive analysis cannot be provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has shown exceptional growth potential in the past, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this growth has been accompanied by substantial volatility.  Current indicators suggest a short-term downtrend, with the stock trading below its moving averages and exhibiting an oversold RSI.  While the expected long-term return is extremely high,  the validity of this projection relies heavily on the underlying model and assumptions, and the considerable historical volatility warrants caution. The most recent earnings data shows fluctuations in both revenue and EPS, highlighting a lack of consistent upward momentum.  To make an informed investment decision, further investigation is required into the recent news, analyst opinions, and the methodology behind the expected return calculation,  as well as a detailed understanding of the duplication in the earnings data.
