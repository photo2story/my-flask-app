## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, and related technologies for computing and graphics.

AMD's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference between AMD's cumulative return (999.37%) and the S&P 500's cumulative return (119.94%) is **879.43%**. This substantial divergence places AMD at the 46.1st percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500, relative to its maximum (1950.2%) and minimum (-37.8%) historical divergences.  The high CAGR values in the provided alpha/beta analysis further support this strong performance relative to the market. However, it's crucial to note the high volatility shown in the CAGR and MDD figures, highlighting significant periods of both substantial gains and losses.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $117.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $118.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $120.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $130.69

The current closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  The recent price change of $2.79 (positive) indicates a slight uptick, but this needs to be viewed within the context of the broader downward trend indicated by the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.61 – Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce back, but not confirming a trend reversal.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.024 – A slightly positive value, suggesting a mildly bullish momentum, but weak overall.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.0% – Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 1128.7% –  This projects a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming the current trajectory continues. This projection should be treated with caution due to inherent market uncertainties.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS, with a noticeable spike in revenue and EPS in Q3 2024.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying drivers of these fluctuations (e.g., seasonality, specific product launches, market conditions).  A consistent upward trend is not clearly evident.  Note the duplicated entry for 2024-10-30; this inconsistency requires clarification.

Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of ROE fluctuations.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has demonstrated exceptionally strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500. However, this performance has been volatile. While recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend, the oversold RSI and a positive (though weak) PPO hint at the possibility of a short-term bounce. The long-term expected return remains substantial, but  this forecast is highly dependent on continued market share growth and sustained high revenue and profit margins.  Inconsistencies in the earnings data and fluctuating ROE warrant further investigation. A comprehensive analysis should incorporate a deeper dive into the company’s competitive landscape, future product roadmaps, and broader macroeconomic factors before making investment decisions.
