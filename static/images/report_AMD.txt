## AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies.

The cumulative return of AMD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative return as of the last day in the provided data is 1347.5 (1477.605 - 130.059).  The relative divergence of 57.3% indicates AMD's performance is considerably above the S&P 500 compared to its historical range of performance relative to the index.  However, it's crucial to remember that this relative divergence is based on historical data and doesn't guarantee future outperformance.  The provided Alpha values of 0.0 throughout the years suggest that the outperformance isn't explained by factors outside the market movements tracked by the beta.  The high Beta values indicate a high sensitivity to overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $137.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $138.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $140.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $151.74

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The last market price of $141.12 indicates a recent slight increase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (31.36):** Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (0.07):** A slightly positive value, indicating some bullish momentum but weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence: NaN (-):**  The absence of a value and the indication of a recent short-term decline suggests a lack of data or an inconsistent measurement.
* **Expected Return (2497.4%):** This extremely high expected return, particularly when considering it is relative to the S&P 500 over a long term (2+ years), should be treated with extreme caution.  Such high returns are exceptionally unlikely and should not be considered reliable.  The underlying methodology for this calculation is not provided and warrants further scrutiny.  The market is inherently unpredictable.  A 141.12 closing price wouldnâ€™t trigger a significant change in analysis as it is still within the recent price range.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD shows a strong recent performance exceeding the S&P 500 significantly.  However, the extremely high projected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  The stock is currently trading below its moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a rebound, the overall trend requires more detailed analysis based on missing information (market outlook, analyst opinions, and the methodology behind the 2497.4% expected return).  The most recent earnings report shows strong growth in revenue and EPS. However, long-term sustainability of this growth requires further research.  The provided financial data paints a picture of generally healthy growth and profitability.  A more comprehensive analysis would require addressing the missing data points mentioned above.
