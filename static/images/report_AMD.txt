**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.48 | $6.82 B     |

| 2024-10-30 | $0.18 | $5.80 B     | *(Duplicate entry, likely a typo)*


Revenue shows a generally increasing trend, though there's fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. EPS also shows variability, but the most recent quarter (October 2024) shows a significant jump in earnings per share.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMD exhibits strong historical performance significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  However, the recent price action indicates a potential short-term bearish trend.  While recent earnings and financial data suggest a healthy company with growing revenue and profitability, the high volatility (as evidenced by the beta and MDD) requires careful consideration. The  expected return of 1381.9% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500, is very high and may need further substantiation with more detailed modeling.  Further investigation into the duplicate entry in the earnings data and clarification on the calculation of the expected return are recommended before making any investment decisions.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high rewards with the inherent significant risk.
