2024-12-22 - Analysis Report
## AMD Stock Review: October 26, 2024

This report analyzes Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies, based on provided data.


**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMD's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 908.5 percentage points (1025.22 - 116.71 = 908.51).  The provided relative divergence of 47.6% indicates AMD's performance lies in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $119.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $122.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $132.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $146.55

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (15.64):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-1.00):** Shows a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-3.4%):**  Confirms a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2471.6%):** This extremely high projected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 needs further context and is likely not realistic without deeper analysis of the underlying assumptions. The current price ($119.21) does not show evidence of a recent significant price surge.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows mixed trends:

* **Revenue:** Revenue generally increased throughout the period except for a slight drop between Q2 and Q3 2024.  The most recent quarter (Q3 2024) shows the highest revenue at $6.82B.
* **EPS:** EPS fluctuated significantly quarter-to-quarter, with a peak of $0.48 in Q3 2024 and a low of $0.08 in Q1 2024. The data also shows a duplicate entry for October 30th, 2024. This inconsistency needs clarification.

Without further data (e.g., analyst expectations), it's impossible to determine if these results beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has shown a general upward trend, though with some quarterly variations.  Profit margins are consistently high, though they decreased slightly in Q1 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has steadily increased. ROE fluctuates significantly, with highs and lows depending on profitability, suggesting potential inconsistencies in profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This data was not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD's performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500 historically, but recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend. While the company shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins in recent quarters, EPS has been volatile. The exceptionally high projected long-term return requires additional justification and may not be reliable.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain the reasons for the fluctuating EPS, the discrepancy in the October 30th, 2024 data, and to incorporate recent news and analyst opinions for a comprehensive assessment.  The currently provided technical indicators point towards a potential short-term bounce from oversold conditions, but this should be considered cautiously given the prevailing bearish momentum.  The data provided is insufficient for a confident long-term outlook.
