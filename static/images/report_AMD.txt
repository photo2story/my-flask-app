**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

AMD, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., designs and manufactures computing and graphics products.  The provided data shows significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), with substantially higher cumulative returns and volatility.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this performance and its sustainability.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 751.36%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 71.02%
* **Return Difference:** 680.3%
* **Relative Divergence:** 35.2% (This indicates AMD's performance is in the 35.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, considering the max and min differences observed.)

The massive difference in cumulative returns highlights AMD's significant outperformance. However, the high relative divergence, while impressive, also suggests significant volatility and potential for future underperformance.  The historical Alpha and Beta values further support this.

* **Previous Close:** $93.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $102.90

The sharp price drop warrants consideration of potential negative news impacting AMD's value.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has shown exceptional long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent performance has been weak, with the price significantly below its moving averages and technical indicators suggesting a bearish short-term outlook.  The high Beta highlights the stock's significant market risk.  While the long-term outlook remains positive, based on expected return projections, investors should be aware of the current high risk and volatility.  Careful consideration of recent earnings reports and potential market factors impacting the recent price decline is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) require further clarification.
