2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down this AMD analysis and create a comprehensive report.

**1. Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) is a global semiconductor company that designs and produces microprocessors, graphics processors, and other technologies for the computer, gaming, and data center markets.
*   **Return Rates:**
    *   AMD Cumulative Return: 481.49%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 99.09%
    *   Divergence: 382.4 (Relative Divergence: 55.7)

*   **Analysis:**  AMD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The divergence of 382.4 indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns.  The relative divergence of 55.7 suggests that, compared to its historical divergence range with the S&P 500, AMD's current outperformance is in the middle range. The high fluctuation range implies the company has very volatile in the past.
    *   The Alpha and Beta analysis provides a more granular view.  Here's a breakdown of what these metrics mean:
        *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The average annual growth rate over the period.
        *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, indicating risk.
        *   **Alpha:**  A measure of the investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis, relative to a benchmark (in this case, likely the S&P 500).  A positive alpha indicates outperformance.
        *   **Beta:**  A measure of the investment's volatility relative to the market. A beta of 1 means the investment moves in line with the market.  A beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility.
        *   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions.

    *   **Table Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2023-2025  | 161.0% | 82.4% | 97.0% | 0.7 | 327.3 |

        *   AMD demonstrated strong growth (high CAGR) in the 2017-2021 timeframe. The company's market capitalization (Cap(B)) also increased significantly during this period.
        *   The negative CAGR values in 2020-2024 indicates significant declines in value during those periods. However, the 2023-2025 period shows a strong rebound.
        *   The consistently high MDD values highlight the risk associated with investing in AMD.
        *   The Alpha values are generally very high when positive, indicating significant outperformance relative to the market. The negative Alpha values show periods of underperformance.
        *   The Beta value increased over the years (from 0 to 0.7), this means that the AMD stock is becoming more and more correlated with the stock market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Current Close Price: 201.06
*   Last Market Data: {'price': 201.06, 'previousClose': 198.11, 'change': 1.49} (a slight increase from the previous close)
*   5-day SMA: 205.34
*   20-day SMA: 213.04
*   60-day SMA: 221.60

*   **Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, further confirming this trend. While the current price shows a small rebound from the previous close, it hasn't yet broken above any of these moving averages.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 29.07

*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = -7.4 (-): 단기하락
*   Expected Return (%): 292.5%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A value of 0.7 indicates a medium level of investment risk.
    *   **RSI:**  An RSI of 29.07 suggests that the stock is currently oversold (below 30 is generally considered oversold). This could indicate a potential buying opportunity if you believe the stock is fundamentally sound and likely to rebound.
    *   **PPO:**  A negative PPO (-0.80) indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, confirming the downtrend suggested by the SMAs.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100% of cash" signal suggests that the system recommends investing fully at this time, despite the downtrend signals. This is influenced by the MRI value.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change (-7.4) confirms the short-term decline.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (292.5%) is a very bullish signal, suggesting that, based on the model's analysis, AMD is significantly undervalued and poised for substantial growth over the long term.
