**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) designs and manufactures microprocessors and related technologies for computers and other electronic devices.  AMD's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by a substantial margin (601.4%). While the relative divergence of 35.1% suggests strong historical outperformance, it's crucial to remember this is a historical measure and doesn't guarantee future returns.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and significant outperformance (positive alpha) in most periods, particularly from 2017-2021. However, recent periods (2022-2025 projections) show substantial negative returns, highlighting the inherent risk in AMD's stock.  Note that Beta values are exceptionally high, indicating much higher volatility than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $88.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $93.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $102.75

The price is currently slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a relatively stable short-term trend. However, it's below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a possible downward trend in the medium to long term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Market Risk:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.49 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.37 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1852.5% (Long-term significant outperformance vs. S&P 500 predicted)


The indicators present a mixed picture.  The MRI suggests a moderate risk level. While the RSI is near neutral and the PPO positive, the price action relative to the moving averages points to a more cautious outlook. The high expected return needs to be considered in light of the substantial volatility observed in the historical data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.48 | $6.82 Billion  |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.16 | $5.83 Billion  |
| 2024-05-01 | $0.08 | $5.47 Billion  |
| 2023-11-01 | $0.18 | $5.80 Billion  |
| 2024-10-30 | $0.18 | $5.80 Billion  | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Revenue shows a general upward trend, with a significant jump in the October 2024 quarter.  EPS fluctuates, highlighting the volatility in earnings.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis. This data is crucial for assessing AMD's profitability and overall financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD's historical performance has been exceptional, significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  However, the high volatility and recent projected negative returns highlight substantial risk.  While long-term projections suggest significant outperformance, investors should be aware of the substantial price swings and the lack of complete financial data.  Further investigation into the missing financial information and clarification on the duplicated earnings data are necessary for a more robust assessment. The medium risk level suggested by the MRI and the mixed signals from the technical indicators support a cautious approach.  Investing in AMD requires a high risk tolerance.
