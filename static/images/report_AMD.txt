## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a multinational semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies.

The cumulative return for AMD is 1113.66%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 117.62%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 996.0, placing it at the 52nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong outperformance, though the relative percentile suggests periods of underperformance have occurred historically.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $129.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $123.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $125.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $140.27

The current price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend but a longer-term downward trend from the peak represented by the 60-day moving average.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.36 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.715 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +1.6 (Indicates a recent short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 912.4% (This represents a significant outperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, but should be viewed cautiously given the inherent uncertainty of long-term forecasts.)

The current price of $129.55 doesn't immediately signal a dramatic price shift (neither a sharp surge nor a steep decline), considering its position relative to moving averages and the RSI value. However, the significant expected return should be considered within the context of the inherent risk associated with AMD's high growth and volatility.
