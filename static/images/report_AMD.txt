**Analysis:**

*   AMD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined.  The 351.73% cumulative return is far greater than the S&P 500's 91.00%.
*   The divergence of 260.7 indicates AMD's outperformance relative to VOO. The relative divergence of 57.7 suggests that AMD's current outperformance is moderately above its historical range compared to VOO.
*   **Alpha:** The high positive Alpha values in most periods (especially 2016-2021) demonstrate AMD's ability to generate returns independent of the market. The negative Alpha values from 2020-2024 show underperformance relative to the market during those specific periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta consistently remains above 1, indicating AMD is more volatile than the overall market (S&P 500). A Beta of 2.1 implies that, on average, AMD's price moves 2.1% for every 1% move in the S&P 500.
