## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Investment Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a multinational semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, and related technologies.

The cumulative return of AMD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 892.4 (1013.52 - 121.09).  The relative divergence of 46.8% indicates that AMD's performance has been substantially above the S&P 500 over the observed period, although this is relative to the historical range of divergence.  The provided table shows highly variable CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), ranging from substantial gains to significant losses, indicating high volatility.  The high beta values also confirm this volatility and high correlation with the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $118.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $120.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $130.27

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price change of $1.29 shows a slight uptick, however, this doesn't change the overall downward trend suggested by moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.52  - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning towards the oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.12 - A positive value indicates bullish momentum, although it is relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.9 - Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1100.5% -  This extremely high expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs careful consideration.  While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, this figure suggests a significant outperformance is projected. The extreme nature of this prediction requires deeper scrutiny of the underlying model used to generate this figure.  The recent price movements counter this expectation to some degree.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture. While revenue is generally increasing, EPS (Earnings Per Share) fluctuates considerably.  There's a noticeable spike in EPS in the October 2024 quarter which requires further investigation into the underlying drivers.  A more complete picture would benefit from analyzing year-over-year growth, not just quarter-to-quarter.  The duplicated October 30th, 2024 entry needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.48 | $6.82B      |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.16 | $5.83B      |
| 2024-05-01 | $0.08 | $5.47B      |

| 2024-10-30 | $0.18 | $5.80B      | *(Duplicate Entry - Needs Clarification)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data indicates strong revenue growth, with healthy profit margins. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is relatively low, suggesting that the company may not be utilizing its equity as efficiently as it could.  Further analysis is required to understand the factors driving the ROE.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $6.82B  | 50.14%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.83B  | 49.08%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.47B  | 46.78%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.17B  | 47.20%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.80B  | 47.36%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE     |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $56.98B  | 1.35%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $56.54B  | 0.47%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $56.20B  | 0.22%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $55.89B  | 1.19%   |
| 2023-09-30 | $54.97B  | 0.54%   |



**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has shown periods of exceptional growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, it's also characterized by substantial volatility, as reflected in its high beta and fluctuating CAGR.  Recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend. While the projected long-term return is very high, this prediction warrants careful examination of its underlying assumptions.  The company's financial statements show strong revenue growth and profit margins but relatively low ROE. Further investigation is needed to clarify the duplicate earnings data entry and to fully understand the factors driving the significant variability in EPS and ROE.  A comprehensive investment decision should incorporate a deeper dive into these inconsistencies, as well as a detailed risk assessment given the company's volatility.
