2024-11-22 - Analysis Report
## Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a multinational semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, and related technologies.

The cumulative return of AMD is 1482.49%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 125.68%. The difference in cumulative returns is 1356.81%.  The relative divergence of 57.7% indicates AMD's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, but this is a relative measure and doesn't imply future outperformance.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and significant outperformance in certain periods (2016-2020), followed by a period of underperformance (2022-2024).  The high Beta values (1.6 to 2.1) indicate AMD is significantly more volatile than the market.  High Alpha values suggest substantial outperformance of the market in many periods but this was not consistent in recent years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $137.6 (Last Market: $137.43)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $137.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.23

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.39 -  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.46 -  Suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -7.96 - Indicates a recent short-term weakening in relative performance against the S&P 500.  A potential short-term correction is likely.

Given the last market price of $137.43 is relatively close to the closing price, no significant immediate 급반등 (sharp rebound) or 급하락 (sharp decline) is evident based solely on this data.


The expected return of 227.7% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant figure; however, it's crucial to remember that this is an *expected* return and not a guaranteed outcome.  Such high expected returns usually accompany high risk.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue figures.  While the October 2024 quarter shows improved EPS and revenue compared to previous quarters, the overall trend isn't entirely consistent.  To adequately assess performance, the revenue and EPS figures need to be compared against analyst expectations for the same periods.  Without this crucial context, any conclusion regarding the success or failure of the company is premature.

**5.  Financial Information Analysis:**

The quarterly data shows strong revenue growth but inconsistent profitability margins and ROE.  The profit margin fluctuates, and the ROE is relatively low considering the overall revenue growth. More in-depth analysis is needed to understand the underlying causes of this fluctuation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Information Needed:** To provide an accurate analysis of recent news and market outlook, please provide links to relevant news articles (from sources like Shacknews or FINBOLD)  and any analyst reports.  Without this information, I cannot comment on recent earnings news, analyst opinions, or market performance highlights.

**7.  Comprehensive Analysis:**

AMD shows a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this has been inconsistent in recent periods and accompanied by high volatility.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction may be underway. While the long-term expected return is high, the high beta signifies considerable risk.  A detailed analysis of the financial reports, considering analyst expectations, and up-to-date news is needed to form a well-informed investment decision. The lack of recent news and analyst insights prevents a complete evaluation of AMD's current market position and prospects.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Due to insufficient information (specifically recent news and analyst opinions), providing a definitive investment recommendation is not possible. A thorough review of the latest news, financial reports (compared to expectations), and analyst ratings is crucial before forming an opinion on AMD.  The high volatility of AMD makes it unsuitable for risk-averse investors.
