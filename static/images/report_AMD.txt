## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Investment Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors and related technologies for servers, workstations, PCs, game consoles, and other devices.

The cumulative return of AMD is 1095.82%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.78%. The difference in cumulative returns is 974.04%.  The provided relative divergence of 50.9% indicates that AMD's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been in the upper half of its historical range of outperformance.  The historical data reveals periods of extreme outperformance and underperformance, highlighting the volatility inherent in this stock.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $126.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $128.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $136.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $149.22

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (29.84):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.63):** Suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-2.0):** Shows a recent decrease in relative outperformance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2307.6%):** This extremely high projected return over the long term (2+ years)  relative to the S&P 500 needs to be viewed with caution.  Such projections are highly speculative and depend on numerous unpredictable factors. The current price of $126.69, being below the moving averages and having negative PPO and 20-day relative divergence change, doesn't strongly support an immediate price rebound. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, it doesn't guarantee an immediate reversal.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture:

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has generally increased quarter-over-quarter, except for a slight dip from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024.  However, Q3 2024 shows a significant increase compared to Q1 2024.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS fluctuated considerably throughout the reported quarters. There is no clear upward trend, with notable drops in Q2 and Q1 2024.
* **Quarterly Comparison:** The most recent quarter (Q3 2024) shows higher revenue ($6.82B) and EPS ($0.48) compared to the previous quarter (Q2 2024). However, this needs to be put in context of the previous quarters for a full picture of the trends.  There were previous quarters with higher EPS, suggesting it is too early to determine the establishment of a trend.

Without information on earnings expectations, we cannot assess whether the reported numbers represent beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has shown growth and slight fluctuations throughout the reported period. Profit margins have generally been healthy, exhibiting slight variability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has steadily increased. ROE has varied significantly from quarter to quarter, not showing a consistent trend.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which are not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has demonstrated exceptionally strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent data shows a weakening trend in its short-term price action and relative strength. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, other indicators paint a more cautious picture.  The projected long-term return is highly speculative and should not be taken as a reliable forecast.  More data (particularly analyst expectations and recent news) is needed for a complete assessment. The current earnings data indicates some variability in revenue and earnings, without a clearly defined trend.  Further investigation into these earnings compared to analyst expectations would enhance analysis.  Caution should be exercised given the high volatility displayed in the historical data and the current indicators suggesting a possible downward trend.
