## AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500:**

AMD's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO), with a difference of 959.21 percentage points on the last day of the provided data.  The relative divergence of 50.1 indicates that AMD's performance relative to the S&P 500 is in the upper half of its historical range.

* **Company Overview:** Advanced Micro Devices Inc is a semiconductor company that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided Alpha values are exceptionally high, suggesting significant outperformance compared to the market.  However, the Beta values of 0.0 across all periods are unrealistic. Beta measures a stock's volatility relative to the market. A beta of 0 indicates no correlation with the market, which is highly improbable for a company like AMD.  This data requires further verification.


**2. Recent Price Action:**

AMD's recent price action shows a downtrend. The current price ($125.56) is below the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages ($127.87, $135.55, and $148.69 respectively).  This suggests short-term bearish momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (31.37):** This value suggests AMD is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (-0.6856):**  A negative PPO signals bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-1.4):** The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days further confirms the short-term bearish trend.  
* **Expected Return (2345.7%):** This extremely high expected return figure should be treated with caution.  While it suggests significant potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, it's crucial to understand the underlying assumptions and methodology used to arrive at this figure. It seems unrealistically optimistic.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* **Latest Quarter Comparison:**  Revenue increased significantly in the most recent quarter (2024-10-30, $6.82B) compared to the previous two quarters ($5.83B and $5.47B). EPS also increased substantially from $0.16 and $0.08 to $0.48.
* **Revenue Growth Trend:**  Revenue shows a generally upward trend, although there was a slight dip in the two quarters preceding the latest.
* **EPS Trend:** EPS has fluctuated but shows a significant positive jump in the latest quarter.
* **Beats/Misses:**  The provided data doesn't include expectations, so it's impossible to determine if these results represent beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has generally increased over the past five quarters. Profit margin has also shown a slight upward trend, reaching 50.14% in the latest quarter.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has steadily increased, indicating a growing capital base. However, ROE has fluctuated and remains relatively low, peaking at 1.35% in the most recent quarter. This suggests that despite increasing equity, AMD's profitability in terms of return on equity is not consistently strong.


**6. News and Recent Events:**

Information regarding earnings news within the last two days, recent market outlook, and analyst opinions is missing. This information is crucial for a comprehensive analysis.

**7. Summary:**

AMD's recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, but some indicators, like the RSI, suggest it might be approaching oversold territory.  The latest earnings show strong revenue and EPS growth, which is a positive sign. However, the long-term expected return figure seems highly optimistic and needs further investigation.  The provided Alpha/Beta data appears unreliable.  More information on recent news, analyst opinions, and the methodology behind the expected return calculation is required for a complete and actionable analysis.

**8. Recommendation:**

Due to the inconsistencies and missing data in the provided information, forming a clear investment recommendation is difficult.  Further research is needed, particularly regarding the validity of the Alpha/Beta data and the long-term expected return calculation.  It is also essential to gather information about recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions before making an investment decision.
