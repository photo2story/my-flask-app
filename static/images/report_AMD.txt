The beta values are notably high, indicating higher volatility compared to the market. The most recent period (2022-2024) shows negative returns for AMD, although still maintaining a positive alpha.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $138.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $144.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $151.96

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.
