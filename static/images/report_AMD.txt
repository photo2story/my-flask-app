## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

AMD, a leading designer and manufacturer of computer processors and related technologies, shows significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods. While recent price action indicates a slight downturn,  strong earnings growth and high projected long-term returns suggest potential for continued growth. However, significant volatility should be considered.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

AMD's cumulative return of 986.26% drastically outperforms the S&P 500's 119.91% cumulative return.  The difference (866.3%) places AMD's performance in the 45.5th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500 (max: 1950.2%, min: -37.8%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals substantial alpha (outperformance relative to the market) particularly in the 2017-2021 period, indicating strong stock-specific performance.  High beta values (especially in 2018-2021) signal AMD's higher volatility compared to the overall market. The recent negative CAGR (2022-2024) highlights a period of significant underperformance, which needs further investigation.


**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $115.95
* **5-day Moving Average:** $116.27
* **20-day Moving Average:** $120.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** $129.84

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price change of -$2.45 reflects a relatively significant drop from the previous closing price.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 49.85 - Suggests the stock is near neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO:** 0.05 - A positive value indicates bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -3.1 - Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.

The recent price drop (-$2.45) contributes to the negative relative divergence. While not a "sharp" drop, it is notable. The expected return of 1154.5% over the long term (2+ years) versus the S&P 500 is extremely high, suggesting significant potential but also considerable risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD exhibits impressive long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this performance comes with high volatility, as demonstrated by its high beta and recent price decline.  The recent earnings report shows strong revenue growth and improving profit margins. While the short-term trend is slightly bearish, the long-term outlook, supported by  strong earnings growth and high projected returns, remains potentially positive for long-term investors.  However, investors should carefully consider the inherent risk associated with this high-growth, high-volatility stock.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
