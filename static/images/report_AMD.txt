**Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) Investment Analysis Report**

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. designs and manufactures microprocessors and related technologies for the computing and graphics markets.

The cumulative return for AMD is 987.10%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 112.20%.  The difference is a substantial 874.90%.  This places AMD's performance at the 45.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided maximum and minimum values.  This highlights AMD's strong historical outperformance but doesn't guarantee future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $116.04
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $124.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $124.20
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $138.07

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short-to-medium term.  This aligns with the negative delta in the relative strength index.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 42.99 – This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory (below 30 is generally considered oversold), suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.20 – A positive value suggests upward momentum, though it's relatively low.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence:** -2.1 – This indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1133.5% – This represents a significant projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, but it needs to be considered in context of higher risk. The current price of $116.04 being lower than the moving averages could be indicating a temporary correction, however, a sharp decline should be cautiously considered given the forecast.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD shows a history of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this has involved periods of high volatility.  The recent price action suggests a short-term downward trend, although the RSI suggests potential for a rebound.  The long-term expected return is very high, but this should be viewed with caution given the inherent risks associated with such a high growth prediction and market volatility.  A thorough understanding of the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistent EPS and low ROE need further investigation.  The duplicate entries in the earnings data require clarification before meaningful conclusions can be drawn.
