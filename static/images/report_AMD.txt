**Analysis:** The table presents rolling 3-year periods.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows high growth in the earlier periods, with negative growth in the more recent periods, reflecting recent market challenges.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant risk of loss.
*   **Alpha:** Generally positive, demonstrating outperformance relative to the market (risk-adjusted). However, recent Alpha values are negative.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 155.61
*   **Previous Close:** 146.24
*   **Change:** 6.41
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 146.168
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 138.233
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 117.6832

**Analysis:**  The current price is above all moving averages, indicating an upward trend. The significant "change" from the previous close (6.41) suggests a recent positive price surge.

**3. Indicators and Signals:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.341 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 71.93 (Overbought territory, potentially indicating a price correction soon)
*   **PPO:** 0.30 (Positive, suggesting an upward trend but also indicating short-term price volatility)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_13%_Buy 80% of cash (4377 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) (Cash Ratio: 13% on 2025-07-15) (Indicates a buy signal but with caution due to market conditions)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-): short-term decline
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1271.6 (Significant potential long-term outperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**  The RSI indicates that the stock might be overbought and due for a pullback.  The PPO supports the upward trend. The "Hybrid Signal" is interesting – it suggests a buy but with a significant cash allocation as a hedge. The very high "Expected Return" should be viewed with caution, as it's based on models and historical data and doesn't guarantee future results. Given {'price': 155.61, 'previousClose': 146.24, 'change': 6.41}, the recent price surge of 6.41 warrants attention and the reason behind it is required.
