**7. 종합 Conclusion**

AMD exhibits high growth potential with a strong long-term expected return. However, this comes with substantial volatility, as indicated by the high MDD and recent negative Alpha. Recent market indicators like the negative change in relative divergence and news of stock volatility suggest potential near-term risks.  The RSI near overbought levels may also indicate a potential pullback. The company's financials show solid revenue and profitability, but the recent dip in EPS and revenue growth requires monitoring.

**Recommendation:**

Given the high potential return but also significant risk, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon. Monitoring upcoming news and earnings reports will be crucial.
