A price of $142.0 doesn't indicate a dramatic price movement (neither rapid surge nor drop), given the context of the moving averages. The expected return of 2426.1% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 signifies a very optimistic outlook, although highly dependent on continued market outperformance.  This projection should be treated with caution due to its significant magnitude and inherent volatility in the sector.

AMD exhibits significant long-term growth potential but also considerable volatility.  While past performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500, this does not guarantee future success.

Further research into recent news, analyst opinions, and a deeper dive into the reasons for the fluctuations in EPS and ROE is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
