**1) Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for AMD over several periods, indicating strong growth. However, it also shows periods of significant maximum drawdown (MDD), highlighting the volatility inherent in AMD's stock.  The alpha consistently above 0 suggests outperformance compared to the benchmark, while the beta fluctuates significantly, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements.

AMD has demonstrated substantial growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over several periods.  However, its high volatility is evident in the significant MDD and recent price movements.  While current technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce, the stock's performance remains subject to significant market fluctuations. The long-term projected return is extremely high, but this must be considered alongside the risks associated with AMDâ€™s volatility.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data and a more detailed understanding of current market conditions are necessary for a complete assessment.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in AMD.
