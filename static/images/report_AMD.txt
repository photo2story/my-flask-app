## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

AMD, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., designs and manufactures microprocessors.  The provided data reveals significant outperformance against the S&P 500 (VOO) with a vastly higher cumulative return.  However, recent performance shows volatility.

**1) Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 685.53%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.69%
* **Return Difference:** 618.8%
* **Relative Divergence:** 35.8% (This indicates AMD's performance is significantly higher than the S&P 500, but within the range of historical deviations. It's not a measure of future outperformance.)

The alpha and beta analysis shows high growth (CAGR) and high volatility (MDD) in previous periods, with fluctuating alpha and a relatively high beta (indicating sensitivity to market movements), especially during 2015-2017 and 2016-2018.  Recent years show decreased growth and negative CAGR.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 168.0% | 67.7% | 139.0% | 0.0 | 16.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 330.0% | 76.2% | 312.0% | 0.0 | 30.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 519.0% | 76.2% | 490.0% | 0.3 | 74.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 995.0% | 76.2% | 970.0% | 0.2 | 149.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 1220.0% | 65.4% | 1166.0% | 0.2 | 233.8 |
| 2020-2022  | 109.0% | 77.6% | 102.0% | 0.2 | 105.2 |
| 2021-2023  | 226.0% | 77.6% | 209.0% | 0.7 | 239.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -311.0% | 77.6% | -328.0% | 0.7 | 196.2 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $90.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $99.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $106.33

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend.  The recent increase of $1.18 from the previous close indicates a small upward movement.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.41 (Below 30 indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.57 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** 0.4 (+), indicating short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1813.4% (This is a significant figure that needs further contextualization; it's the predicted excess return versus the S&P 500, but its reliability depends on the methodology used to arrive at this number and the inherent uncertainties in long-term predictions.)


The combination of a high MRI, low RSI, negative PPO, and the price being below its moving averages paint a picture of a potentially risky situation, despite recent small price increases.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.48  | $6.82 B      |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.16  | $5.83 B      |
| 2024-05-01 | $0.08  | $5.47 B      |
| 2023-11-01 | $0.18  | $5.80 B      |
| 2024-10-30 | $0.18  | $5.80 B      |

There's a significant jump in EPS and revenue in the October 2024 quarter.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this is a sustainable trend.  Note there seems to be a duplicated entry for October 30th, 2024; this needs clarification.

Equity is increasing, but ROE fluctuates.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMD has shown exceptional long-term growth significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, recent performance indicates higher risk.  The company's financial health appears strong, with increasing revenue and high profit margins.  The current price is below its moving averages, and technical indicators suggest bearish sentiment. The extremely high projected long-term return (1813.4%) needs significant scrutiny due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting long-term returns.  Further investigation into the recent earnings surge and clarification on the duplicate entry is necessary.  Investors should carefully consider the high volatility and risk involved before investing.
