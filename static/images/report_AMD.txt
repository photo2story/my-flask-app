## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

AMD, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors.  This report analyzes AMD's performance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 686.85%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.27%
* **Return Difference:** 620.58% (AMD significantly outperformed VOO)
* **Relative Divergence:** 35.9% (Indicates AMD's performance is in the upper 36th percentile relative to its historical performance against VOO).  The high relative divergence despite the large absolute difference highlights periods where AMD's outperformance was even more extreme in the past.


The provided Alpha and Beta data show high growth potential (CAGR) with considerable risk (MDD).  The increasing Alpha values over time suggest consistent outperformance compared to the market (Beta reflects market sensitivity).  However, the dramatically negative CAGR in the last two years (-311% and -308%) indicates significant market corrections affecting AMD's share price.  Capitalization (Cap(B)) shows robust company growth over time until a slight downturn.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $95.29
* **5-day Moving Average:** $93.75
* **20-day Moving Average:** $99.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** $105.89

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short-to-medium term.  The recent price increase of $0.84 (from $94.50) indicates a minor upward correction, but it's still within a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.67 (Approaching oversold territory;  could signal a potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.1386 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.9 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1805.7% (Significantly higher than VOO, but highly speculative given the volatile nature of AMD and the inherent uncertainty of long-term predictions)

The positive change in relative divergence suggests a recent short-term price increase but the negative PPO and low RSI indicate the overall bearish momentum, potentially indicating a temporary correction. The high expected return is highly optimistic and should be viewed with extreme caution, considering the inherent risks in long-term stock market investments.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has shown remarkable growth in the past, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent data reveals a bearish trend, with the price below key moving averages and negative PPO indicating bearish momentum. While the high expected return is enticing, it is crucial to acknowledge the high risk associated with AMD's volatility and the inherently uncertain nature of long-term predictions.  The significant drop in CAGR in the last two years also suggests high risk.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the duplicate earnings data.  Investors should carefully consider these factors alongside their own risk tolerance and investment strategy before making any investment decisions.  More comprehensive fundamental and technical analysis is recommended before taking any action.
