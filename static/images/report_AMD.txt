## Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) Stock Performance Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

AMD, a leading designer and manufacturer of computing and graphics products, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return of AMD is substantially higher than VOO, indicating strong performance. However, recent price action shows a decline.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 751.36%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 71.02%
* **Return Difference:** 680.3%
* **Relative Divergence:** 35.2% (This signifies AMD's performance relative to its historical volatility against VOO, not a direct percentage superiority.)

The data clearly shows AMD's exceptional performance relative to the broader market (S&P 500).  The significant positive difference in cumulative returns highlights AMD's outperformance.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for AMD across various periods, alongside substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  The Alpha values generally indicate outperformance against the benchmark (positive alpha), especially in recent periods.  The high Beta values (particularly in earlier periods) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth over the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $85.76
* **Previous Close:** $93.80
* **Change:** -$8.04 (Significant drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $102.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $109.23

The stock price has recently declined significantly, trading below all three moving averages. This suggests a bearish trend in the short term.  The substantial drop from the previous close indicates a potentially negative market event impacting the stock price.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 28.24 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -1.51 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -4.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1919.6% (Long-term, significantly exceeding S&P 500)


The technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. The low RSI suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a short-term rebound. However, the negative PPO and the significant price drop indicate ongoing bearish pressure.  The high MRI underscores the inherent risk. The high expected return is a long-term projection and depends on numerous factors.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue. While there's a general upward trend in revenue, EPS shows variability, indicating inconsistent profitability.  Further analysis would require examining the reasons for such fluctuations.  The data also appears to have a duplicate entry for 2024-10-30.


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability metrics show a positive trend.  Revenue is consistently increasing, although the growth rate may be slowing. Profit margins are also generally high and increasing in recent quarters, which is a positive sign.  Equity is also increasing, but the Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile, which merits further investigation into the factors influencing it.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has demonstrated exceptional long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the recent price drop and negative technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend.  The high expected return projects long-term growth potential, contingent upon numerous factors, including sustaining robust revenue and profitability growth. Investors should carefully weigh the risks associated with the high volatility of the stock before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and fluctuations in EPS and ROE is recommended.  The apparently duplicated data point for October 30th, 2024 should be addressed.
