## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a multinational semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), AMD shows a significantly higher cumulative return.  The provided data shows AMD's cumulative return at 1015.21% versus VOO's 116.43%. This represents a substantial difference of 898.77 percentage points. The relative divergence of 47.1% indicates AMD's performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500 based on historical data. However, it's crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results.  The high volatility is evident in the maximum and minimum divergence values (1950.2 and -37.8, respectively).


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values for AMD across several periods, punctuated by periods of significant negative returns, highlighting its volatile nature. The consistent near-zero beta values suggest a low correlation with the overall market. However, this needs to be contextualized within the very high volatility the company exhibits.  The unusually high alphas in some periods and nearly zero alphas in other periods may suggest market regime changes significantly affecting AMD's performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $119.04
* **Last Market Price:** $119.24
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $122.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $135.53

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 39.83 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.0473 (Slightly positive, suggesting a potential bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.4% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1086.0% (Significant expected outperformance versus the S&P 500,  but high uncertainty given the volatile nature of AMD.)

The relatively low RSI and the negative short-term divergence signal possible further downward pressure.  The positive PPO offers a slight counterpoint, suggesting potential for a small rally.  The 1086% expected return is highly speculative and contingent on numerous factors.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |

Revenue shows growth and seasonality.  EPS is volatile, reflecting the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and market fluctuations.  The duplicate entry for October 30, 2024, needs clarification.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD exhibits extremely high growth potential and volatility. While the long-term expected return is substantial, itâ€™s crucial to understand the high risk associated with this investment. The company is significantly outperforming the S&P 500, but this outperformance may not be sustainable given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential for market corrections.  The recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, but the approaching oversold RSI and positive PPO hint at a potential rebound.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data point and a deeper dive into the company's financials and future projections are needed to solidify any investment decision.
