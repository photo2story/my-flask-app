## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a multinational semiconductor company designing and manufacturing computer processors and related technologies.

The cumulative return of AMD is 1050.80%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 928.64%. This places AMD's performance at the 48.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on a historical range of -37.8% to 1950.2%.  While significantly outperforming the S&P 500 in this period, the relative percentile indicates periods of underperformance have also existed.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $122.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $122.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $122.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $132.83

The recent price shows a slight downward trend compared to the previous close ($123.04), however, all moving averages are relatively close to the current price suggesting a period of consolidation.  The 60-day MA being notably higher suggests recent price action is below the average performance of the last two months.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.02 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 0.73 (Positive value, indicating bullish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.8 (Short-term upward trend.)

The recent price change of -$0.16 does not represent a significant drop, and considering the positive PPO and slightly above neutral RSI, there's no indication of a major price reversal.  The expected return of 1030.4% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is exceptionally high and should be viewed with caution given its inherent uncertainty.  This figure should not be interpreted as a guaranteed return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.48  | $6.82B       |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.16  | $5.83B       |

There's significant variability in EPS. Revenue generally shows growth, although Q2 2024 saw a slight dip compared to Q1 2024.  The duplicate entry requires correction for accurate analysis.

| 2023-09-30 | $5.80B   | 47.36%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE     |

| 2024-09-30 | $56.98B   | 1.35%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $56.54B   | 0.47%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $56.20B   | 0.22%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $55.89B   | 1.19%   |
| 2023-09-30 | $54.97B   | 0.54%   |

Both revenue and profit margins show generally positive trends, with a notable increase in revenue and profit margin in Q3 2024. ROE fluctuates, indicating potential variability in profitability relative to equity.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has demonstrated exceptionally strong performance relative to the S&P 500 over the given period, significantly exceeding its benchmark. However,  it's crucial to note the high volatility evident in both price movements and earnings, highlighting the inherent risk associated with this stock. The high projected long-term return should be viewed with skepticism, as past performance doesn't guarantee future results.  Fundamental indicators like revenue and profit margins show generally positive trends, while the ROE needs further examination to determine the drivers of this variability. Before any investment decision, further investigation into AMD's business strategy, competitive landscape, and potential risks is strongly recommended.  The presence of duplicate data points in the earnings data requires clarification and correction to support a more robust analysis.
