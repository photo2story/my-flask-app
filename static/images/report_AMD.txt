## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

AMD's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While VOO shows a cumulative return of 89.44%, AMD boasts a staggering 909.28%, indicating substantial outperformance.  However, recent performance has been volatile, as shown by the negative CAGR in the 2022-2024 period.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a multinational semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, graphics processing units (GPUs), and related technologies.

AMD's cumulative return (909.28%) drastically surpasses the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (89.44%).  The provided data shows a current divergence of 819.8%, placing it at the 41.6th percentile of its historical divergence range (max: 2017.7%, min: -33.4%).  This relative percentile does not imply consistent outperformance, but rather its position within the historical context of its price divergence from VOO.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high alpha values (generally above 0.1, exceeding the market) and fluctuating beta values throughout the analyzed periods (2015-2025). This suggests periods of significant outperformance compared to the market (high alpha) with varying levels of market sensitivity (beta). The high volatility is further emphasized by the negative CAGR observed during 2022-2024.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) also demonstrates significant growth throughout these years.

* **20-day Moving Average:** 103.81
* **60-day Moving Average:** 110.90

The price is slightly above the previous close and below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.
