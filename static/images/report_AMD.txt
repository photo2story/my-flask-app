Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

AMD's cumulative return (673.84%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (76.18%). The difference is substantial at 597.7%, placing it at the 34.9th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500 based on the provided range (max: 1774.8, min: -32.1). This indicates that while AMD has historically outperformed the S&P 500 considerably,  its current outperformance is relatively moderate compared to its historical maximum divergence.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for AMD, exceeding 100% in multiple periods.  However, the last two years (-311% and -321% CAGR) indicate significant negative growth.  The Beta values are consistently high (16.7 to 30), signifying high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha values, representing excess return relative to the market, are generally positive, although inconsistent, demonstrating periods of significant outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  It's crucial to note that these are past performance figures and don't guarantee future results.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMD has historically demonstrated significant growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent data reveals a downtrend, with the price below its moving averages and negative PPO. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, potentially hinting at a rebound, the high beta indicates substantial volatility. The high expected return needs further justification and should be treated with extreme caution. The fluctuating earnings and ROE also warrant careful consideration.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough review of AMD's fundamentals, industry outlook, and competitive landscape is crucial.  The provided data alone is insufficient for making definitive investment recommendations.  Further investigation into the methodology used for the exceptionally high "Expected Return" is necessary.  The duplicated earnings data entry also needs clarification.
