* **Closing Price:** $86.26
* **5-day Moving Average:** $88.58
* **20-day Moving Average:** $95.06
* **60-day Moving Average:** $103.49

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price change of $0.82 (Last-market data) shows a slight upward movement, but within the context of the overall downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.98 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.55 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 1885.0%  (This represents a substantial projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year horizon. However,  this projection should be viewed cautiously given the high volatility shown in historical data.  The possibility of significant losses remains.)


**Conclusion:**

AMD has shown periods of exceptionally high returns, but also significant volatility and recent losses. While the long-term expected return is high, the high risk associated with AMD (as evidenced by the high beta and recent negative performance) necessitates a careful consideration of risk tolerance before investing. The current technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, although the RSI is approaching oversold levels.  Further analysis and diversification are recommended.
