## AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.) Stock Report

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. designs and manufactures microprocessors and related technologies for various applications.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

AMD's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 933.15%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 120.25%
* **Return Difference:** 812.9%
* **Relative Divergence:** 42.8% (This indicates AMD's performance relative to VOO is in the 42.8th percentile of its historical range of divergence, considering a range from -37.8% to 1950.2%).

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows high volatility and strong outperformance in certain periods (e.g., 2018-2020, 2019-2021), but also periods of significant underperformance (e.g., 2022-2024).  The high beta values suggest AMD's returns are highly sensitive to market movements.  Note that the CAGR is significantly influenced by the extreme volatility exhibited by the company.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $111.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $110.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $116.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $125.99

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The small positive change in the last market day (`Last-market` data) hints at potential short-term recovery, but further observation is necessary.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 34.02 (Below 30 suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.41 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1280.5% (Significantly outperforms S&P 500 over the long term).  This high expected return should be viewed cautiously given the substantial volatility inherent in AMD's performance.  The 0.56% increase in price needs to be taken into account in the analysis. A moderate price increase could be interpreted as a short-term recovery from an oversold condition.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD shows exceptionally high growth potential compared to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by substantial volatility.  While recent price action and technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend, the strong financial performance, high expected long-term returns, and oversold conditions (RSI) could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance.  However, careful monitoring of the market and AMD's performance is crucial due to its sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Further investigation into the duplicated entry in the earnings data is needed. The high beta suggests that AMDâ€™s returns are extremely sensitive to market moves.  This needs to be incorporated into investment decisions.
