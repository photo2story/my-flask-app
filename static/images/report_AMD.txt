*   **Company Overview:** Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a global semiconductor company that designs and manufactures computer processors and related technologies.
*   **Cumulative Return (AMD):** 481.49%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 99.09%

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| 2015-2017  | 96.0%    | 73.9% | 67.0%   | 0.0   | 16.7    |
| 2016-2018  | 203.0%   | 82.0% | 188.0%  | 0.0   | 30.1    |
| 2017-2019  | 250.0%   | 82.0% | 228.0%  | 0.2   | 74.7    |
| 2018-2020  | 442.0%   | 82.0% | 418.0%  | 0.2   | 149.3   |
| 2019-2021  | 402.0%   | 76.5% | 355.0%  | 0.4   | 234.3   |
| 2020-2022  | -113.0%  | 84.9% | -112.0% | 0.4   | 105.5   |
| 2021-2023  | -13.0%   | 84.9% | -14.0%  | 0.6   | 240.0   |
| 2022-2024  | -231.0%  | 84.9% | -252.0% | 0.6   | 196.7   |
| 2023-2025  | 161.0%   | 82.4% | 97.0%   | 0.7   | 327.3   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   AMD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.
    *   The relative divergence of 58.8 suggests that while AMD's outperformance is strong, it's not at its absolute peak compared to its historical range against the S&P 500.
    *   **Alpha:** The consistently high Alpha figures (especially in earlier years) indicate AMD's ability to generate excess returns independent of market movements (S&P 500).  However, Alpha becomes sharply negative in the 2020-2024 period, reflecting a period of underperformance. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a positive, but lower Alpha.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values, while generally low, show a gradual increase. This indicates that AMD's price movements are becoming slightly more correlated with the overall market. A Beta of close to 1 would indicate similar volatility to the market, while a Beta less than 1 suggests it is less volatile.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD figures are high, indicating significant potential for losses during downturns.
    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows periods of very high growth (2016-2020), followed by periods of decline and then a resurgence.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 201.06
*   **Previous Close:** 198.11
*   **Change:** 1.49
*   **5-day SMA:** 205.34
*   **20-day SMA:** 213.0384
*   **60-day SMA:** 221.6044

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The relatively small price change on the last trading day doesn't strongly indicate a reversal, but it does show a slight upward movement.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 29.07 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.7986
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-11)
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -4.6 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 264.4%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The RSI indicates that AMD is currently oversold, which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity.  However, oversold conditions can persist.
    *   The negative PPO reinforces the short-term downtrend indicated by the moving averages.
    *   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.  While the MRI has increased to 0.7, it is still below the "High Investment Recommended" threshold.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence (-4.6) confirms the recent downward trend.
    *   The Hybrid Signal is a "Buy" signal.
    *   The exceptionally high Expected Return (264.4%) indicates strong confidence in AMD's long-term potential, but investors should be aware that these are estimates.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   **Positive:**  Mentions of potential price leaks for Ryzen processors, ChatGPT predicting a positive close to 2025, and comparisons with competitors like Micron.
    *   **Negative:** Analyst price target cuts, concerns about Oracle funding, and challenges related to China's AI chip push.
    *   **Neutral/Informative:** Comparison with Intel, analysis of which stock will rally next.

*   **Analysis:**  The news cycle seems to be in a state of flux, with positive catalysts (new product speculation, potential rallies) balanced by headwinds (analyst downgrades, competitive pressures). This uncertainty could be contributing to the recent stock price weakness.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.55)
*   **Target Price:** 281.47 (Avg), 380.00 (High), 178.00 (Low)

*   **Analysis:**  Despite recent price weakness, the analyst consensus remains "Buy" with a significant upside potential based on the average target price. The wide range between the high and low target prices highlights the uncertainty surrounding AMD's future performance. The lack of information on the Recent Rating Changes makes it difficult to assess the latest shifts in analyst sentiment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출     |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-11-05 | 0.76 | 9.25 B$  |
| 2025-08-06 | 0.54 | 7.68 B$  |
| 2025-05-07 | 0.44 | 7.44 B$  |
| 2024-10-30 | 0.48 | 6.82 B$  |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.48 | 6.82 B$  |

*   **Analysis:**  The most recent earnings data (2025-11-05) shows a significant increase in both EPS and revenue compared to previous quarters. The initial listed date (2024-10-30) has the same value as a repeat listing (2025-11-05) and should be investigated/corrected. The overall trend suggests positive growth momentum, particularly in the most recent quarter.
