2025-03-04 - Analysis Report
## AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.) Stock Report

AMD, a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, graphics processing units, and related technologies, has shown significant performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Comparison:**

AMD's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 828.62%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 116.17%
* **Return Difference:** 712.45%  This indicates a substantial outperformance of AMD compared to the broader market.  The relative divergence of 37.7% suggests that AMD's performance is in the upper portion of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals high volatility and significant outperformance in certain periods.  The high beta values (exceeding 1) consistently indicate a higher sensitivity to market movements than the S&P 500.  However, the negative CAGR in 2022-2024 highlights the risk associated with AMD's stock.  The alpha values generally indicate outperformance, particularly in recent years, though this outperformance is not consistently present across all periods.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $99.86
* **Last Market Price:** $101.57 (1.71% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $103.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $110.39
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $120.15

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase, however, may indicate a short-term reversal.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 34.10  (Below 50, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.92 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1574.4% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is predicted over the long term)

The low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the recent downward trend in relative divergence, suggest a bearish short-term outlook. However, the significantly positive expected return suggests potential for long-term growth, especially considering the recent price increase.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMD exhibits high growth potential but significant volatility. While the long-term outlook is positive based on the expected return and revenue growth, the short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The recent price increase may signal a temporary reversal, but investors should carefully consider the high beta and potential for significant price swings.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data is necessary for a more complete analysis.  The high projected long-term returns warrant consideration for long-term investors, but careful risk management is crucial given the volatility.
