## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Report

This report analyzes Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), a leading designer and manufacturer of microprocessors,  based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMD's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference is 1373.01 (1497.79 - 124.78).  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, places AMD at the 58.37th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates substantial outperformance compared to the benchmark index.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high alpha values (ranging from 1.4 to 2.46) across the analyzed periods, indicating significant outperformance relative to the market. Beta values are also high (1.5-30), suggesting that AMD's price is highly volatile and moves more dramatically than the market as a whole.  However, note the significant variation in beta, potentially indicating changes in market sensitivity over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $138.93 (Last Market: $138.96)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $139.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $147.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.62

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend in the short term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (24.51):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce.
* **PPO (-0.69):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-9.59):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (227.29%):**  This projects a substantial long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 if a buy-and-hold strategy is implemented.  This should be considered with caution, as it is a projection and not a guarantee.  The high value may reflect the high risk and volatility associated with AMD.
* **Market Impact of $138.96:** The provided closing price is close to the last market price, suggesting no significant immediate price jump or crash.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows fluctuation, with some quarters displaying high growth and others showing stagnation or decline.  Further analysis is needed to interpret the exact underlying drivers of these fluctuations.  Missing expected values for comparison prevents a complete analysis.

**5.  Quarterly Financial Data Analysis:**

**(1) Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some variability, but overall a positive trend. Profit margins are consistently high, above 46%, reflecting strong profitability.

**(2) Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing, indicating a healthy financial position. ROE is volatile, but generally positive indicating reasonable returns on equity.  More context and detailed analysis are needed for a complete interpretation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* (This section requires input of the "shacknews, etc." news sources mentioned, and relevant analyst opinions from sources like FINBOLD to provide a meaningful analysis).  Please provide the news data.  An analysis will then be made.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD exhibits significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, as evidenced by its high cumulative return and consistent alpha. However, this outperformance comes with considerable volatility (high beta). Recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend, though oversold RSI conditions hint at possible short-term upward movement.  The projected long-term outperformance is substantial, but this should be carefully evaluated in the context of AMD's historically high volatility.  Strong profitability is apparent in recent quarters.  However, a full assessment requires a detailed analysis of the news sources and the missing data (expected EPS and revenue, specific analyst ratings).

**8. Recommendation:**

A comprehensive assessment incorporating the missing news analysis and thorough financial statement review is crucial before formulating any investment recommendation. The high volatility and strong historical outperformance demand a thorough risk-tolerance assessment for any investor.  The high expected return is enticing, but only after a deep dive into the business fundamentals, competitive landscape, and future prospects, should any investment decision be made.  It is important to remember past performance does not guarantee future results.
