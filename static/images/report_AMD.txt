## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is a multinational semiconductor company specializing in the design and manufacturing of microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), and related technologies.

The cumulative return for AMD is 1466.85%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1338.0%.  While the relative divergence suggests AMD's performance is in the higher percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (56.9%), it's crucial to remember that this doesn't guarantee future outperformance.  The maximum historical divergence is 2380.9% and the minimum is -40.0%.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high alpha values (significantly outperforming the market) and a relatively high beta (indicating higher volatility than the market) particularly in the earlier periods (2015-2019).  The more recent periods (2020-2024) show lower alpha and a more stable beta around 3.0.  This suggests a shift in AMD's performance relative to the market, potentially reflecting maturity and less dramatic growth compared to its earlier years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $136.24
* **5-day Moving Average:** $138.19
* **20-day Moving Average:** $141.10
* **60-day Moving Average:** $151.77

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.25 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound. However, it's not a reliable indicator on its own.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.02 – This is near neutral territory, suggesting neither strong bullish nor bearish momentum.

* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -6.7% – Shows a recent short-term downward trend.

* **Expected Return:** 2512.6% – This is a remarkably high projected long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500.  Such a high figure needs to be treated with extreme caution and requires careful consideration of the underlying assumptions and potential risks. It's crucial to understand that past performance is not indicative of future results. The current price of $136.24, while below recent averages, does not necessarily indicate a dramatic event (like a rapid drop or rebound) on its own.  More context is needed regarding market conditions.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS.  While the most recent quarter (2024-10-30) shows strong revenue ($6.82B) and EPS ($0.48),  it's crucial to compare this against expectations to gauge the market's reaction.  More information regarding analyst estimates for the 2024-10-30 quarter is necessary for a comprehensive assessment.  The data suggests some seasonality in revenue, with higher figures in Q3 and Q4.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  The data shows consistent revenue growth, though profit margins have fluctuated slightly.  The high profit margins (around 50%) are a positive indicator.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has grown steadily, while Return on Equity (ROE) has been relatively low and inconsistent, suggesting areas for potential improvement in capital efficiency.

**8. Overall Analysis Summary:**

AMD has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting periods of strong growth and high alpha.  However, recent price action suggests a short-term downward trend.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, and the long-term expected return is exceptionally high, this needs to be interpreted cautiously.  The company demonstrates strong revenue and profit margins but relatively low and inconsistent ROE.  A detailed analysis of recent news, analyst opinions, and comparison of actual earnings against expectations is vital to forming a well-informed investment decision.  The extremely high projected long-term return requires further investigation into its underlying assumptions and the associated risks.
