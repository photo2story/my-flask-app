**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

AMD's cumulative return (683.70%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (66.36%). The difference is substantial (617.3 percentage points).  The relative divergence of 35.7% indicates that AMD's performance sits relatively high compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500, though this is not a prediction of future performance. The provided data shows high volatility, with maximum divergence reaching 1784.8% and minimum divergence -31.6%.

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows significant outperformance (high Alpha values) in some periods, but also periods of substantial underperformance (negative CAGR).  High Beta values, especially in 2015-2019, indicate high sensitivity to market movements.  The recent years show more consistent positive alpha.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $88.16
* **20-day Moving Average:** $100.27
* **60-day Moving Average:** $106.73

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $5.3 (from $88.7) shows a significant, rapid bounce.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.28 (Suggests oversold conditions, but should be interpreted with caution)
* **PPO:** -1.07 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +0.1 (Short-term upward trend, but given the RSI and PPO, this should be viewed cautiously)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1821.1% (This is a very high figure and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  The projection likely incorporates high growth assumptions that may not materialize).

**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMD has shown remarkable growth exceeding the S&P 500 significantly, but this is associated with high volatility and risk (High MRI, and large swings in CAGR). Recent price action suggests a potential downward correction despite a recent short-term upward bounce.  While financial statements show strong revenue growth and high profit margins, the EPS and ROE figures are inconsistent and need further investigation.  The very high projected long-term return (1821.1%) requires extreme caution and should not be considered reliable.  Further due diligence and a careful consideration of risk tolerance is crucial before investing.  The data provided suggests strong growth potential but also significant risk.  Independent verification of data accuracy is highly recommended.
