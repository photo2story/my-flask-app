2024-12-25 - Analysis Report
## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

AMD's cumulative return (1092.04%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (120.69%) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is 971.4%, placing it at the 50.8th percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500.  AMD shows substantial outperformance relative to the broader market.

**Company Overview:** Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is a multinational semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, particularly between 2018 and 2021.  However, the Alpha consistently sits at 0.0, suggesting that the outperformance is not entirely due to factors independent of market movements. The Beta values are extremely high, indicating high sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The wildly fluctuating CAGR and significant negative CAGR in 2022-2024 highlight substantial volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $126.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $122.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $131.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $145.26

The price is currently below both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The 5-day moving average being below the current price indicates recent price recovery, but the overall trend remains bearish in the medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 26.86 – This suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce back.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.29 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.7 – Shows a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 2317.8% – This extremely high figure represents the projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 under the given model, assuming a continued similar trend of the past.  Such high expected returns are unlikely to materialize and should be treated with extreme caution.  Given the history of wild swings and high beta, this projection is highly speculative.

The current price of $126.29, while below recent averages, doesn't suggest any extreme events (like a dramatic drop or sudden surge) based solely on this data.

* **Missing Data:**  No information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD shows significant historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but this is characterized by substantial volatility.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term bearish trend. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions and a possible bounce, the negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.  The financial information demonstrates fluctuating but generally positive revenue and profit margin growth.  The high expected return needs to be treated with serious caution given its dependency on the past volatile performance and the lack of context.  More information on recent news, analyst sentiment, and earnings expectations is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The high beta highlights AMD's susceptibility to market fluctuations and inherent risk.  Investors should consider their risk tolerance before investing in AMD.
