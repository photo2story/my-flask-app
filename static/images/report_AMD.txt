## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

AMD, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing CPUs, GPUs, and related technologies.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns for AMD compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).


**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **AMD Cumulative Return:** 683.92%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** 601.4% (This is the raw difference.  The relative divergence of 35.1% indicates AMD's performance is in the upper 35th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on its maximum and minimum historical divergence.)

The data clearly indicates that AMD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered.  However, the high Beta values (particularly in earlier years) suggest substantial market sensitivity.  While the Alpha values indicate periods of outperformance, they are volatile and depend heavily on the market cycle.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The table shows high and volatile CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), reflecting AMD's significant growth potential but also its inherent risk.  The high Beta values confirm its sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Notice the dramatic drop in CAGR from 2021-2025, indicating a recent downturn.

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term bullish momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term correction.  The recent $4.51 increase represents a notable, rapid upward movement.

* **RSI:** 50.49 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.3742 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1852.5% (This extremely high figure needs careful consideration. It is likely based on the historical outperformance and may not be sustainable).

The indicators paint a mixed picture. While the PPO and relative divergence suggest bullishness, the RSI is neutral and the MRI indicates moderate risk. The extremely high expected return should be treated with caution.  The recent price jump should be noted as potentially impacting the reliability of short-term indicators.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by high growth in revenue and profits. However, this performance is associated with high risk due to its high Beta. The recent price jump and mixed technical indicators suggest a need for caution.  While the long-term outlook appears positive based on the financial data and recent earnings, the extreme projected return should be treated skeptically. Further investigation is needed to validate the data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) and understand the drivers behind the recent surge in the stock price. A thorough risk assessment is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility and market sensitivity of AMD should be carefully considered in any investment strategy.
