## AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.) Stock Analysis Report

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing CPUs, GPUs, and related technologies.


**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

AMD's cumulative return of 678.67% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 78.93% over the analyzed period.  The difference is a substantial 599.7 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 35.0% indicates that AMD's performance is positioned relatively high compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500,  but this is not an indicator of future outperformance.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and significant outperformance against the market (high Beta) in certain periods, particularly from 2017-2021. However, the recent periods (2022-2025) show negative CAGR, suggesting market headwinds or company-specific challenges.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.39
* **5-day Moving Average:** $87.60
* **20-day Moving Average:** $93.83
* **60-day Moving Average:** $103.08

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term. The recent price change of $4.79 (from $86.26 to $90.39) indicates a significant positive move, potentially signifying a bounce or temporary recovery from a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.35 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.1854 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1860.5% (This extremely high expected return requires further scrutiny, especially given the recent negative CAGR and the negative technical indicators.  It's crucial to understand the basis and assumptions behind this prediction.)

The recent price increase needs to be interpreted cautiously in the context of the negative technical indicators.  While a short-term bounce is possible, the overall picture suggests potential further downside risk. The high expected return is suspect and necessitates more detailed justification and analysis of its source.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Summary:**

AMD has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent performance indicates potential challenges. While the company shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, the volatility in EPS and the negative technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) raise concerns about short-to-medium term prospects.  The extremely high projected return needs rigorous justification and validation.  A comprehensive analysis considering macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is crucial before drawing definitive conclusions about AMD's investment potential.  The current data suggests a need for caution before committing to a long-term investment.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent negative CAGR is highly recommended.
