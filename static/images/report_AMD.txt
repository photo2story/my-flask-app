## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Investment Report

This report analyzes Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), a company designing and manufacturing microprocessors and related technologies for computing and graphics applications.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMD's cumulative return of 1521.06% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 129.75%.  The difference is 1391.3 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 59.1% indicates AMD's performance is substantially higher than the S&P 500 over the period considered, placing it in the upper percentiles of historical performance relative to the index.  However, this is a historical snapshot and doesn't predict future performance.  The provided CAGR data shows significant year-over-year variability, highlighting the inherent risk in AMD's high-growth, cyclical business model.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $141.98 (Last-market: $142.77)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $139.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $140.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $151.93

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the last market price indicates limited volatility in the immediate period.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.21 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.53 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (-) – This implies a recent short-term downward trend. However, the absence of a numerical value makes definitive interpretation impossible.
* **Expected Return:** 2426.1% – This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500. This forecast needs careful consideration; it’s likely based on certain assumptions and may not accurately reflect future realities.  The 2426.1% expected return is exceptionally high and should be treated with a high degree of skepticism.

The provided earnings data reveals fluctuating revenue and EPS:

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth is inconsistent.  There was growth from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024, with a slight dip in Q2 2024. Comparing Q3 2024 to Q1 2024 represents  growth.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news is provided, along with no market outlook or analyst opinions. This information is crucial for a complete investment assessment and is currently missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has demonstrated historically strong performance relative to the S&P 500. However, the data highlights significant volatility in both price and financial metrics.  The high expected return of 2426.1% needs critical evaluation due to its magnitude and the absence of underlying assumptions and supporting data.  The currently available technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook, though the lack of data on recent news and analyst sentiment hinders a full assessment.  The company's financial performance shows positive revenue growth in the most recent quarter, but with fluctuations in profitability and return on equity. More information is needed, particularly about recent market sentiment and analyst opinions to determine a more definitive investment recommendation.  The high historical performance is noteworthy but cannot be relied upon to predict future outcomes.  A detailed analysis of the expected return calculation and its underlying assumptions is crucial before considering its validity.
