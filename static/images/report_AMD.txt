*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values (mostly in the 65-78% range) point to significant downside risk.
*   **Alpha:** High positive Alpha values in most periods indicate AMD has generated returns above what would be expected based on market movements alone. Negative alpha's are present in the two most recent periods.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values are generally low, suggesting AMD's price is not highly correlated with the overall market.
