## Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Review

This report analyzes Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), a semiconductor company designing and manufacturing microprocessors, primarily for computers, servers, and embedded systems.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

AMD's cumulative return of 1105.73% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.40% over the analyzed period.  The difference is 985.3 percentage points. The relative divergence (51.5%) indicates that AMD's performance is in the upper half of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  While impressive, this comparison lacks a specified timeframe; a longer-term perspective is needed for comprehensive context. The provided CAGR data in the table reinforces this superior performance, with significantly higher growth rates than implied by the cumulative return.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $127.74
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $136.51
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $138.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $150.84

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The gap between the current price and the moving averages indicates potential for further downward pressure.  The 127.76 last market price doesn't suggest any significant abrupt change, although it's important to note the price is trending downward.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (33.16):**  Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.30):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -6.7%, indicating a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 2275.1% â€“ This represents a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, but this prediction needs to be treated with caution and should be viewed in context of historical volatility and potential market shifts.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a mixed bag in recent quarterly performance:

* **Revenue:** Revenue generally increased QoQ except for a dip between Q2 and Q3 of 2024.  Overall revenue shows an upward trend from 2023 to the most recent quarter of 2024.
* **EPS:** EPS fluctuated significantly quarter over quarter,  with the highest EPS reported in Q4 2024 at $0.48.  Significant drops were observed between several quarters, requiring further analysis for the drivers of such volatility.
* **Missing Comparison to Expectations:** The table lacks information about whether these results met or exceeded analyst expectations.  Without this information, a full assessment of performance cannot be made.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue is generally increasing, however, profit margin shows some minor fluctuations quarter-over-quarter.  While the revenue shows growth, the slight reduction in profit margin in some quarters warrants further investigation.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has steadily increased, showing growth in the company's net worth.  ROE shows some volatility, with higher values in the Q4 periods indicating strong profitability during these quarters, again highlighting the need for further analysis to understand the underlying reasons for the fluctuations.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  The prompt only mentions to include "Recent Market Outlook," "Analyst Opinions," and "Performance Highlights," but the provided data does not furnish this.  To effectively complete this section, information on recent news, market sentiment surrounding AMD, and analyst reports and ratings needs to be added.  The lack of specifics on "earning news" within the last two days necessitates further research.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMD has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, the current short-term trend appears bearish, as indicated by the price being below its moving averages and negative PPO. The RSI suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a short-term rebound.  Long-term prospects look positive, particularly if the projected long-term expected return materializes, but this is subject to significant market risks.  The quarterly earnings show some volatility, warranting a deeper dive into the factors driving these fluctuations.  Crucially, the analysis is limited by the absence of information on earnings expectations and recent news, both of which are needed for a complete and accurate evaluation.
