2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided data for Arm Holdings PLC ADR (ARM), including a comprehensive summary:

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO) Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** ARM
*   **Company Overview:** Arm Holdings designs semiconductor intellectual property (IP) and licenses it to companies that manufacture chips.
*   **ARM Cumulative Return:** 5.63%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 53.52%
*   **Divergence:** -47.89
    *   **Divergence Range:** -119.2 to -41.6
    *   **Current Divergence:** -41.6
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (at the bottom of its recent range)

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Table**

*   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha (-55%) indicates that ARM has significantly underperformed its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis during the 2023-2025 period.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 0.6 suggests that ARM is less volatile than the market.  It moves about 60% as much as the market.
*   **CAGR:** The 6.0% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is positive but significantly lower than the S&P 500's return.
*   **MDD:** A 75.0% MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates a significant potential for loss from peak to trough. This is a high level of risk.
*   **Cap(B):** Market cap of 120.4B

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 113.51
*   **Previous Close:** 114.58
*   **Daily Change:** -0.93
*   **5-day SMA:** 120.89
*   **20-day SMA:** 132.88
*   **60-day SMA:** 149.42

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day).  This indicates a downtrend. The fact that the shorter-term moving averages are below the longer-term moving averages reinforces the downtrend.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 21.20 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.55
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.8 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%) :** 3811.5
*   **Price action**: -0.93

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium risk investment environment.
*   **RSI:**  The RSI of 21.20 indicates that the stock is oversold and might be due for a short-term bounce.
*   **PPO:** The PPO indicates that the stock is oversold as well.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  Recommends buying 90%
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return of 3811.5% should be viewed with extreme skepticism. It likely reflects some kind of model anomaly or optimistic assumption and should not be taken as a realistic prediction.
*   **Price action**: The recent small decline is not very important.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Negative Sentiment:**  The news headlines are overwhelmingly negative.
*   **Goldman Sachs Downgrade:**  Multiple articles mention a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, which is a significant negative catalyst.
*   **Price Decline:** Articles specifically address the stock's decline and whether to "buy the dip."
*   **Overall:** The news flow suggests significant concerns about ARM's near-term prospects.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** "Buy" (Mean = 2.26)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 32
*   **Target Price:** Average = 164.85, High = 215.00, Low = 80.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** (Information missing, but the text implies recent changes occurred)

**Analysis:**

*   **Conflicting Signals:**  The analyst consensus is "Buy," with a significant average target price above the current price. However, the recent news of downgrades suggests that analyst sentiment might be shifting negatively.
*   **Wide Range:**  The large spread between the high and low target prices indicates a lack of strong conviction among analysts and considerable uncertainty about ARM's future.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** ARM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Downtrend:** The stock is currently in a downtrend, confirmed by moving average analysis.
*   **Oversold:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold and there is a chance for a short-term rebound.
*   **Negative News:** Recent news is largely negative, driven by downgrades and concerns about the company's prospects.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** While the overall analyst consensus is "Buy", recent downgrades and a wide range of target prices suggest a lack of confidence in the stock's future performance.
*   **High Risk:** The significant MDD (75.0%) indicates a high-risk investment.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The MRI suggests medium risk, while many other indicators point to more significant risk.
*   **Overall Assessment:**  Based on the provided data, ARM appears to be a **high-risk investment** with significant challenges. The recent negative news flow and the stock's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 are major concerns. While the oversold RSI may present a short-term trading opportunity, the longer-term outlook appears uncertain.

**Recommendation:**

Given the current situation, a conservative approach is warranted. I would not recommend buying ARM at this time without significantly more information and a clear positive catalyst. Investors holding ARM should carefully consider their risk tolerance and potentially reduce their position. The advertised return rate (3811.5%) must be regarded as extremely unlikely until this anomality is corrected with a proper explanation from the model developer.
