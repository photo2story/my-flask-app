*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 13.01 (Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.27

The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. The very low RSI indicates an oversold condition, which could signal a potential bounce. The negative PPO supports the downtrend. The "Very Safe" hybrid signal is interesting and should be investigated further, particularly the MRI:0.90 used in its calculation. The negative change in the relative gap further confirms the short-term decline. The extremely high expected return suggests significant potential upside over the long term, relative to the S\&P 500.

The small negative change from the previous close doesn't drastically alter the overall trend, but it reinforces the recent weakness.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Positive Sentiment:**
    *   Loop Capital Raises Price Target to \$180
    *   Morgan Stanley Raises Target after Strong Q2 Results

*   **Number of Opinions:** 32
*   **Target Price:** Avg: \$167.97 / High: \$215.00 / Low: \$80.00

Analyst consensus is generally positive with a Buy rating and a significant average target price above the current price.  The wide range in target prices (\$80 - \$215) suggests considerable uncertainty or differing viewpoints on ARM's valuation.

**Positives:**

*   **Strong Analyst Ratings:**  Analyst consensus leans towards "Buy" with a substantial average target price.
*   **High Expected Return (Long-Term):** The data suggests significant potential upside relative to the S\&P 500 over a longer investment horizon.
*   **Oversold Condition:** The low RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce.
*   **Positive News:** Analyst target increases and a strategic investment by Alphabet are encouraging.

**Negatives/Risks:**

*   **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:**  ARM has significantly underperformed the S\&P 500 recently.
*   **High Volatility:** The large MDD indicates significant price swings.
*   **Short-Term Downtrend:** The price is below key moving averages, and the relative gap is declining.
*   **Dependence on AI Growth:** A key growth driver is tied to the future of AI, which is subject to uncertainty.
*   **Nasdaq Sell-Off:**  Broader market weakness, particularly in the tech sector, could negatively impact ARM.

**Conclusion:**

ARM appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment. The strong growth potential (CAGR) and potential for long-term outperformance are attractive. The recent negative performance and broader market risks should be carefully considered. The oversold condition might present a short-term buying opportunity, but investors should be prepared for potential volatility. Further research into the hybrid signal and the reasons for the wide range in analyst target prices is recommended.
