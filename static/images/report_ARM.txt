**Arm Holdings PLC (ARM) Report**

**0)  Executive Summary:**

Arm's recent performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, and indicators suggest caution. While analysts see long-term potential, recent news highlights concerns about valuation and competition. A mixed picture emerges, with both high expected returns and significant risks.

**1) Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **Ticker:** ARM
*   **Company Overview:** Arm Holdings designs semiconductor intellectual property and licenses it to chip manufacturers.
*   **ARM Cumulative Return:** 6.54%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 52.12%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -45.6
    *   Relative Divergence: 3.8

**Analysis:** Arm's performance is significantly underperforming the S&P 500. The negative divergence of -45.6 highlights this underperformance. The relative divergence of 3.8 indicates that the current divergence is near the lowest end of its historical range.  This suggests recent underperformance relative to its own historical volatility.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
| :----------- | :---- | :---- | :------ | :--- | :------- |
| 2024-2026  | 7.0%  | 39.4% | -52.0%  | 2.6  | 121.7  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 7.0% is a moderate projected growth rate.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 39.4% suggests significant potential downside risk.
*   **Alpha:** -52.0% indicates that Arm has significantly underperformed its benchmark index (the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis during this period.  A negative alpha suggests the stock has not delivered excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** 2.6 indicates that Arm is significantly more volatile than the market (S&P 500).  For every 1% move in the S&P 500, Arm tends to move 2.6%.
*   **Cap(B):** 121.7B is the market capitalization.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 114.73
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 114.73, Previous Close: 109.31, Change: 4.96
*   **5-day SMA:** 111.136
*   **20-day SMA:** 122.6095
*   **60-day SMA:** 144.1545

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a recent downtrend. The 5-day SMA being below the current price indicates a very short-term upward trend (bounce).  The 'change' suggests a sharp rebound occurred in the last trading session.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 18.94 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.1793
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-04)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 3.8 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 985.1%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk based on this single indicator.
*   The RSI of 18.94 indicates that the stock is heavily oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, but should be considered in conjunction with other factors.
*   The PPO being negative suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a downtrend.
*   The hybrid signal suggests buying 90% of cash with a recommendation to buy 1 shares (consider safe investment with MRI: 0.80).
*   The recent increase in relative divergence aligns with the recent price rebound.
*   The extremely high Expected Return of 985.1% is unrealistic and should be viewed with extreme skepticism. This likely represents a model-driven estimate and doesn't account for the risks identified in other data.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Qualcomm Acquires RISC-V Designer:** This poses a competitive threat to Arm, as RISC-V is an open-source architecture.
*   **Revisiting Valuation After Share Price Slide:** This indicates concern over Arm's high valuation.
*   **ARM Stock Declines 13%:** Confirms the recent negative performance.
*   **$140 Billion Mirage: AI Hype:** Suggests the stock's valuation may be driven by excessive optimism around AI, rather than fundamental performance.
*   **Buying Opportunity for 2026?:** Contrarian view suggesting potential long-term value.
*   **Goldman Sachs Downgrade:** Indicates further negative sentiment from analysts.

**Analysis:** The news flow is largely negative, focusing on valuation concerns, competitive threats, and recent price declines. The Qualcomm acquisition of a RISC-V designer is a particularly significant development.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (2.21)
*   **Target Price:** 163.25 (Mean)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** (No Data Provided)

**Analysis:** Despite the negative news, the analyst consensus remains "Buy," with a mean target price of $163.25.  This suggests analysts see long-term potential, even with the current challenges. However, the wide range in target prices (80 to 215) indicates considerable uncertainty.  The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the current trend in analyst sentiment.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Arm presents a mixed investment picture. The company is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, and recent price action suggests a downtrend. Negative news flow regarding competition, valuation, and downgrades further weighs on the stock. While the RSI indicates the stock is oversold and there's been a recent rebound, the negative alpha and high beta point to substantial risk. Although analysts maintain a "Buy" rating and project significant future returns, the very high expected return is likely an overestimation and the analyst ratings may not fully reflect the recent negative developments. The Qualcomm acquisition of a RISC-V designer is a significant competitive risk. **Therefore, investors should exercise caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in ARM.**
