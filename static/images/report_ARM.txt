2025-12-25 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided data on Arm Holdings PLC (ARM), comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and including news and analyst opinions.

**1) Return Comparison:**

*   **ARM Holdings PLC ADR (ARM):** A semiconductor and software design company, specializing in ARM architecture.
*   **ARM Cumulative Return:** 6.12%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 55.32%
*   **Divergence:** -49.2 (Relative Divergence: 0.0)

**Analysis:** ARM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative divergence of -49.2% shows the degree of underperformance. The Relative Divergence of 0.0 indicates this underperformance is at the very bottom of its historical range relative to VOO.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 6.0% | 75.0% | -56.0% | 0.6 | 118.3 |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 6.0% - Modest growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 75.0% - Very high risk; significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** -56.0% - Significantly underperforming a benchmark (likely S&P 500).
*   **Beta:** 0.6 - Less volatile than the market; moves about 60% as much as the market.
*   **Cap(B):** 118.3 - Market capitalization in billions.

**Analysis:** This data suggests that while ARM is less volatile than the overall market (Beta of 0.6), it has significantly underperformed in terms of generating returns (negative Alpha) and has experienced a large drawdown. This combination can be worrisome for investors.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 114.03
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 111.55, Previous Close: 112.02, Change: -0.42 (Slight decline in last market)
*   **5-day SMA:** 117.52
*   **20-day SMA:** 131.96
*   **60-day SMA:** 148.97

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three moving averages, indicating a recent downtrend. The fact that the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, further confirms this downward momentum.

**3) Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment) - This suggests a reasonable level of risk, not overly risky or overly safe.
*   **RSI:** 19.47 - This is significantly oversold territory (below 30). Often indicates a potential for a bounce-back.
*   **PPO:** -1.63 - A negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 - Confirms a short-term downtrend.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 3829.0 - Extremely high projected return if held long-term.

**Analysis:** While the MRI suggests a medium investment risk, the RSI indicates the stock is oversold and may be due for a rebound. The PPO confirms the recent downtrend. The extremely high expected return should be viewed with skepticism. Such high numbers are often generated by models that may not accurately reflect real-world conditions. The "cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash" seems contradictory.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** The news headlines are predominantly negative. They highlight concerns about valuation ("$140 Billion Mirage"), price declines ("Declines 13%"), downgrades ("Goldman Sachs Downgrade"), and potential competitive threats ("Qualcomm acquires RISC-V designer").
*   **Contradictory Sentiment:** There are some contradictory headlines like "Is ARM Stock a Buying Opportunity for 2026?", suggesting some analysts see potential despite the negative news.

**Analysis:** The recent news flow is largely negative, which likely contributes to the stock's recent underperformance and downward price movement. The concerns about valuation and competition are important to consider.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean of 2.26) - Contradicts the negative news and price action.
*   **Opinions:** 32 - Significant analyst coverage.
*   **Target Price:** 164.85 (Average) - This is significantly above the current price, suggesting considerable upside potential if analysts are correct.
*   **Target Price Range:** Wide range between 80.00 - 215.00 indicating uncertainty.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent changes indicated.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus, despite the recent negative news, remains positive, with a "Buy" rating. The average target price is significantly higher than the current price, indicating potential upside. However, the wide range in target prices highlights uncertainty among analysts. The lack of recent rating changes makes it hard to measure their changing sentiment.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

ARM's stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, and technical indicators confirm a current downtrend. The high MDD suggests a stock that investors should approach with caution.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   Significantly underperforming the S&P 500.
    *   Negative alpha and a recent downtrend.
    *   Predominantly negative news sentiment, including concerns about valuation, competition, and downgrades.
    *   Price below moving averages.
    *   The high MDD shows it to be a high risk stock.

*   **Positive Factors/Potential Reversal Signals:**
    *   Oversold RSI, suggesting a potential for a bounce.
    *   Analyst consensus remains a "Buy" with a significantly higher target price. The high expected return may have some positive influence.
    *   Market Risk Indicator (MRI) at 0.8 (Medium Investment).

**Conclusion:**

The current situation appears risky. While the oversold RSI and analyst ratings suggest potential for a rebound, the weight of evidence points to caution. The negative news, underperformance, and downtrend should not be ignored. The high expected return should be examined more closely, as such high numbers are often unrealistic.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, it is best to wait for more positive information before buying. The price must break above the moving averages. Be cautious about the positive analyst ratings, as this conflicts with much of the rest of the information provided.
