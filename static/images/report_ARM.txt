2025-12-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided data for Arm Holdings PLC ADR (ARM), compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** ARM
*   **Company Overview:** Arm Holdings is a British semiconductor and software design company.
*   **ARM Cumulative Return:** 29.46%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 55.71%
*   **Divergence:** -29.1 (Relative Divergence: 1.1)

**Analysis:** Arm has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. The divergence of -29.1% means Arm's cumulative return is notably lower than the S&P 500's.  The relative divergence of 1.1 indicates that the current divergence is near the *minimum* end of its historical range (between -30.7 and 119.2). So the underperformance compared to VOO is not extreme compared to its past history, but it is underperforming.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 2023-2025  | 29.0% | 75.0% | -33.0% | 0.6  | 150.0  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 29% over the period is a good return, showing the strong performance from ARM itself.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A 75% MDD is *extremely* high and indicates significant volatility and risk. This suggests that while the stock can grow, it also experiences large declines.
*   **Alpha:** A negative Alpha of -33% means that ARM has underperformed its benchmark (market index) on a risk-adjusted basis. The higher the absolute number, the higher the underperformance of ARM.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 0.6 suggests that ARM's price is less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500).  A beta of less than 1 indicates lower volatility, meaning it is less sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization of 150 billion dollars.

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests that, based on the algorithm, the risk/reward profile is moderately attractive.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 36.20 is nearing the oversold territory (typically below 30), suggesting that the stock may be undervalued and could see a potential bounce.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.194 gives the current percentage level between the 26-period and 9-period EMAs.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  Suggests a predominantly buy signal, tempered with a small cash allocation for safety, reflecting the MRI.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** Indicates a short-term upward trend in relation to its divergence from the S&P 500.  This supports the possibility of a near-term bounce.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return is an algorithm-generated estimate. Use with extreme caution, as such high returns are unlikely and could be based on overly optimistic assumptions. This suggests a potentially significant upside *if* ARM performs as expected.
