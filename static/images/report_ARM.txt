    *   **Analysis:** The stock price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The 5-day SMA is closest to the current price, suggesting some short-term stabilization, but the larger gap to the 20-day and 60-day SMAs highlights the sustained recent price weakness.

The recent market price indicates sharp decline of the price.
