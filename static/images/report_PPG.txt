## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

The cumulative return of PPG (4.81%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (112.20%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is a substantial -107.4%, placing it at the 3.2nd percentile of the historical range of divergence between PPG and the S&P 500 (-111.1% to 6.2%). This indicates a considerable underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting that PPG's performance has been only marginally better than what would be expected given its beta (market risk exposure). The beta values fluctuate, indicating changes in market sensitivity throughout the years, but largely remain above 0.1, indicating above average market risk.   The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates widely, highlighting the volatility of PPG's returns across different periods.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures show substantial losses during certain periods, particularly in 2022-2024 (-68%) and 2023-2025 (-69%), underscoring the risk associated with this investment.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates, reflecting market sentiment towards the company.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $113.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $114.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $119.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $123.24

The current closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 23.98 – This indicates that the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.48 – A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** +1.5 – This points to a short-term upward trend, despite the overall negative picture painted by the moving averages.

The expected return of -1302.5% is highly unrealistic and likely an error in the provided data.  This figure is not a valid indicator of future performance.  A long-term investment in PPG, even with the potential for a rebound indicated by the RSI, carries significant risk given its recent underperformance against the S&P 500.  Therefore, without reliable expected return figures, any claims about outperforming the S&P 500 are premature.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.58B   | 41.79%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.79B   | 42.97%        |

| 2023-09-30 | $4.64B   | 40.74%        |


Revenue shows some fluctuation but remains relatively stable. Profit margins are generally high and consistent, though there's slight variation.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE     |
|------------|----------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.79B   | 6.01%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.77B   | 6.80%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $7.94B   | 5.04%   |

| 2023-09-30 | $7.75B   | 5.50%   |


Equity is relatively stable. ROE (Return on Equity) shows some variability, indicating fluctuations in profitability relative to shareholder equity.  The significantly lower ROE in Q4 2023 is noteworthy and warrants further investigation.

**7. Overall Summary:**

PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, exhibiting considerable volatility and substantial drawdowns. While some short-term indicators (RSI) suggest potential for a rebound, the overall picture remains bearish.  The provided expected return is unreliable.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the reasons for the underperformance and the volatile ROE figures, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Given the historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500,  a long-term investment requires careful consideration of the risks involved. The accuracy and completeness of the data provided is also questionable due to the duplicate entry and implausible expected return.
