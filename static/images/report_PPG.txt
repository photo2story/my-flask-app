## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), PPG's cumulative return significantly lags.  While VOO shows a cumulative return of 120.36%, PPG's cumulative return is only 14.24%. This represents a substantial underperformance of -106.1 percentage points.  The provided relative divergence metric (-106.1/-111.1 to 6.2) places PPG at the 4.3 percentile, indicating significantly lower performance compared to the historical range of VOO's performance against PPG's. The alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance compared to the market benchmark but this is dwarfed by the beta, indicating high market correlation.  The CAGR and MDD data show significant volatility in performance, with periods of strong growth followed by substantial declines.  Note that the data provided does not reflect current market conditions.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last reported closing price:

* **Closing Price:** $123.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $119.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $122.21

The price is above its 5 and 20-day moving averages but slightly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price increase, possibly a short-term trend reversal.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages hints at recent volatility or a period of consolidation after the price change of $2.60 indicated in `Last-market`.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.02 –  Indicates a neutral to slightly bullish momentum.  It's not significantly overbought or oversold.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.73 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.1 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend in relative strength.

The significant positive change in price (`Last-market`) suggests a recent upward price movement. The projected negative expected return of -960.7% is extremely concerning and unrealistic for a publicly traded company. This likely contains an error and should be reviewed further.  If the stated long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to S&P 500 is also -960.7%, this would warrant serious investigation into the methodology behind the calculation.
