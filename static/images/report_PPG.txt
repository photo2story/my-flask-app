## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a leading global supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  Over the period analyzed, PPG's cumulative return of 17.71% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 128.31%. The difference is -110.6%, placing it at the 3.1st percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided Alpha values consistently above 1 suggest that PPG has historically outperformed the market on a risk-adjusted basis, although this is contradicted by the substantially lower cumulative return in comparison with the market.  This discrepancy warrants further investigation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $125.79 (Last Market: $123.15)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $122.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $123.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $126.26

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend, but possibly a longer-term downward trend.  The last market price of $123.15 does not indicate a significant recent jump or drop; further data would be needed to confirm this.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.49 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.14 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, albeit weak)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +1.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates no expected excess return over the long term relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This should be interpreted with caution given the limited information provided).


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue.  While the June 2024 quarter shows high EPS and revenue, subsequent quarters show a decline.  Missing is any comparison to analyst expectations, making a complete assessment impossible.  Further data, specifically analyst estimates and a comparison of actual vs. expected performance, is crucial for a full analysis.

**6. Financial Statement Analysis:**

The provided financial statements reveal fluctuating profitability. Profit margins are generally high but have shown some recent decline.  Return on Equity (ROE) also shows variability, indicating inconsistent profitability.  More detailed analysis requires additional data and context.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires further information.  News from the past two days (specifically earnings news from sources like Shacknews, Finbold, etc.) is needed to assess market sentiment and recent events that may impact PPG's stock price.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights, especially concerning the recent earnings releases, would greatly enhance the analysis.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly over the period examined, despite historical evidence of alpha suggesting risk-adjusted outperformance.  Recent price movement suggests short-term bullishness, but longer-term trends are uncertain.  Technical indicators are neutral to slightly bullish.  Financial performance is somewhat volatile, necessitating a thorough review against analyst expectations.   Missing information regarding recent news, analyst opinions, and comparisons to expected financial performance significantly limits the accuracy and completeness of this analysis.  More comprehensive data, including forward guidance from management and analyst consensus estimates, is needed for a robust conclusion.


**9. Recommendations:**

Further investigation is recommended before making investment decisions.  The discrepancy between historical alpha and recent performance relative to the S&P 500 necessitates a careful examination of the underlying reasons.  Thorough research into recent news, analyst reports, and future company guidance is crucial to forming a well-informed investment strategy.  The limited and conflicting information provided prevents the offering of a specific buy or sell recommendation.
