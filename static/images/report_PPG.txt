**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **Ticker:** PPG
*   **Company Name:** PPG Industries Inc
*   **Company Overview:** PPG Industries Inc. is a global supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.
*   **PPG Cumulative Return:** -38.29%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -140.5
*   **Relative Divergence:** 3.6

**Analysis:**

PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined.  The divergence of -140.5 indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns.  The relative divergence of 3.6 suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range (from min to max divergence), but this doesn't change the fact that PPG's performance has been poor *relative* to the market.

**2. Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha      | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|------------|------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | -35.0%   | 81.0%    | -140.0%   | 0.0  | 23.2   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** -35.0% indicates a strong *decline* in value.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 81.0% signifies a very large potential loss from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** -140.0% suggests substantial underperformance compared to its benchmark, even after accounting for market risk. A negative alpha indicates the investment has performed worse than expected for the risk taken.
*   **Beta:** 0.0 implies that the stock's price is uncorrelated with the market index and does not move in accordance with the index's movements.
*   **Cap (B):** 23.2 B = Market Capitalization of 23.2 billion.

**3. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 103.68
*   **Last Market Price:** 102.99 (change: -0.67)
*   **5-day SMA:** 103.69
*   **20-day SMA:** 102.46
*   **60-day SMA:** 100.17

**Analysis:**

The stock price has recently decreased. The 5-day SMA is slightly above the 20-day SMA, but both are above the 60-day SMA. This *could* indicate a short-term uptrend developing, but further observation is needed.  The close price decrease in the "last market" data suggests some recent downward pressure.

**4. Technical Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 73.48 (Overbought)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.0654
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe, MRI: 0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2009.3%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment risk.
*   The RSI indicates the stock is overbought, which *could* signal a potential pullback.
*   The PPO being positive suggests the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, implying some short-term upward momentum, but this conflicts with the RSI.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days indicates short-term downward pressure.
*   **The extremely negative Expected Return of -2009.3% is highly concerning and warrants further investigation.  This suggests the model predicts substantial future underperformance.**

**5. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) Given Consensus Rating of "Hold" by Brokerages:** A "Hold" rating suggests analysts are neutral on the stock.
*   **Is PPG Industries, Inc.'s (NYSE:PPG) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Financials In Any Way?:** This headline suggests the stock's performance may not be aligned with its underlying financials, raising concerns.

**Analysis:**

The news headlines present a mixed picture. While some articles suggest potential future improvement, others highlight concerns about the stock's performance and financials. The "Hold" rating from brokerages provides little definitive guidance. The negative articles should be carefully scrutinized.
