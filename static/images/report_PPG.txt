**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PPG's cumulative return of 10.75% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return of 116.43% over the analyzed period. The difference is -105.7%, placing it at the 4.6th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $122.38

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.2 – Indicates recent short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -891.7% – This extremely negative figure needs further clarification.  It's likely an error or requires additional context (e.g., specific timeframe, calculation methodology).  A negative expected return of this magnitude would be highly unusual and warrants investigation.
