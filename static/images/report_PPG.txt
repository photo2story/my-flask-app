## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  This report analyzes PPG's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and evaluating its financial health and future prospects.  Key findings suggest underperformance relative to the market, warranting further investigation before investment.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.

* **PPG Cumulative Return:** -3.91%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** -93.4% (This represents a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The relative divergence of -93.4% positions it at the 10.3 percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating consistent underperformance.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta fluctuates significantly), with periods of both outperformance and significant underperformance.  The negative CAGR in recent years (-46% from 2022-2024, -23% from 2023-2025) is alarming.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $108.95
* **Previous Close:** $109.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $109.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $112.11
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $114.82

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price change (-$0.37) indicates a small decline, but is not significant enough to indicate a sudden market shift.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.83 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.27 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +1.7 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -342.1% (This extremely negative value suggests significant potential downside risk over the long term compared to S&P 500.  This needs further investigation and clarification of the methodology used to derive this figure.)

The contradictory signals from the RSI, PPO, and relative divergence require further analysis to determine the strength and reliability of the trend. The extremely negative expected return is a major concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, while financial statements show volatility in revenue and a concerning negative ROE in the most recent quarter. The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant red flag.
