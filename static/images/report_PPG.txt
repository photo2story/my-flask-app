**0. Key Figures Summary:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  The following analysis uses provided data to assess the company's performance.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **PPG Cumulative Return:** 6.84%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 119.91%
* **Return Difference:** -113.07%  (PPG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period).
* **Relative Divergence:** 0.0% (Based on the provided min/max range, this indicates PPG's performance is at the lower end of the historical range relative to the S&P 500).

The provided alpha and beta values show significant variation year-over-year, indicating fluctuating performance relative to the market.  While some years show positive alpha (outperformance), recent years (2022-2025) show substantial negative alpha and high beta (high market sensitivity).  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has remained relatively stable around $30B.  Note the CAGR also shows substantial fluctuation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $115.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $121.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $121.78

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent significant price drop (-$6.00 from the previous close) indicates a notable negative shift.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.75 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.095 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, though very weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.2% (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return:** -4452.0% (This extremely negative figure suggests a highly pessimistic outlook on long-term (2+ years) performance relative to the S&P 500, given the current situation).  The large negative change in price from the previous close reinforces this bearish outlook.  This warrants a careful re-evaluation of the data and methodology used to calculate this figure.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the measured period. While the financial data indicates relatively strong revenue and profit margins, the recent price decline, negative expected return prediction (-4452%), and negative alpha suggest considerable risk.  The inconsistency in earnings data and the extremely pessimistic long-term expected return require further investigation to determine the validity of these numbers.  Before considering any investment, further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind the significant underperformance and the extremely negative expected return figure.  The substantial recent price drop warrants close attention to news and further fundamental analysis to ascertain the underlying reasons.
