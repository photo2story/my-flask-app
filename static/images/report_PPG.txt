**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.

Given the underperformance, inconsistent financial data, and the lack of recent news analysis, a thorough investigation of PPG's future prospects, competitive landscape, and any potential catalysts for growth is necessary before making any investment decision.
