**7. Overall Summary:**

PPG's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, exhibiting substantial underperformance. While some short-term technical indicators suggest bullish momentum, the long-term expected return is extremely negative, and the provided data contains inconsistencies.  Revenue and profit margins are relatively strong, but the variability in EPS and ROE raises concerns.  The exceptionally low projected long-term return (-1193%) necessitates a thorough review of the methodology used for this projection, as well as further investigation into the data inconsistencies and underlying market conditions.  Before considering any investment, a more detailed fundamental analysis, including a thorough review of the -1193% expected return calculation, is strongly advised.
