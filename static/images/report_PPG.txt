| 2023-2025  | -23.0%  | 80.6%   | -86.0%  | -1.0   | 23.6     |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR has fluctuated significantly over the periods, with some positive years but recent negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is very high, consistently above 69%, which indicates substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently negative, which means PPG has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis during these periods.  The negative alpha is especially pronounced in recent years.
*   **Beta:** Beta has also been negative in recent years, suggesting an inverse correlation with the market.  However, the magnitude is relatively small, indicating that PPG's price movements are not highly sensitive to market movements.
*   **Market Cap:** Market cap fluctuates over time.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movements**

*   **Current Price:** 104.43
*   **Previous Close:** 104.52
*   **Change:** -0.09
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 104.506
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 107.395
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 110.0358

**Analysis:**  The current price is slightly down compared to the previous close. The stock price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The 5-day moving average is slightly above the current price, which could indicate a potential short-term stabilization, but the broader trend remains negative as it is below the 20-day and 60-day averages.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 28.32 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.2639
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -0.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (9 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02)
*   **Expected Return:** -7046.3% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**  The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, contradicting other indicators. The RSI indicates that the stock is currently oversold, which *could* suggest a potential for a rebound, but must be considered with the broader negative trend. The negative PPO confirms the downtrend. The negative change in relative divergence suggests short-term downward momentum. The extremely negative expected return indicates very poor projected performance compared to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon.  The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, likely based on the oversold conditions, but this should be viewed with caution considering the other negative indicators.

The small price change from the previous close (-0.09) is not a significant price movement, so there's no immediate "event" reflected in that specific data point.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Color of the Year:** PPG announced "Secret Safari" as the 2026 Color of the Year. This is a marketing and branding event.
*   **Battery Coatings Market:** PPG is mentioned as a key player in the battery coating market. This is positive as it aligns PPG with the growing EV market.
*   **EV System Solutions:** PPG is showcasing coatings and EV system solutions in Detroit. This is a positive signal of PPG's involvement in the EV sector.
*   **Analyst Price Target:** BMO Capital lowered its price target to $126 but maintained an "Outperform" rating.
*   **Cost Actions & Acquisitions:** PPG is benefiting from cost-cutting measures and acquisitions, but is facing weak demand.
*   **Q3 2025 Earnings Preview:** An article discusses expectations for PPG's Q3 2025 earnings.

**Analysis:** Recent news presents a mixed picture.  The color of the year announcement is a standard marketing activity.  The involvement in battery coatings and EV system solutions is a positive strategic move.  However, the lowered price target, weak demand, and focus on cost-cutting suggest challenges.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean Rating: 2.25)
*   **Target Price:** $126.50 (Average) / $145.00 (High) / $112.00 (Low)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not provided.

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is "Buy," and the average target price is $126.50, which is above the current price. However, note that BMO Capital recently lowered its target. The high and low targets indicate a wide range of opinions among analysts.  Without recent rating changes, it's difficult to assess the latest sentiment shift.

**7. Overall Summary**

PPG Industries (PPG) is currently facing significant challenges. It is underperforming the S&P 500 substantially. Its recent stock performance is weak, with the price below key moving averages, and an oversold RSI.  The negative expected return is a major concern. While analyst consensus is "Buy" with a higher target price, recent news and financial data suggest caution. The company is involved in growing sectors like EV battery coatings, but is also facing weak demand and cost-cutting pressures. Profit margin have remained stable.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, a **HOLD** or **SELL** recommendation would be more appropriate than a buy, despite the analyst consensus. The negative trends in performance, combined with the very negative expected return, outweigh the potential for a rebound based solely on the oversold RSI and analyst ratings. Investors should carefully monitor the company's upcoming earnings reports and guidance for signs of improvement.
