## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PPG Industries Inc. is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

The provided data shows a significant underperformance of PPG compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  While PPG's cumulative return is 7.91%, VOO's is 112.74%. This results in a substantial lag of -104.8%, placing it at the 5.4th percentile of the historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  The alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, indicating marginal outperformance, but the beta shows varying levels of market sensitivity.  The significantly negative CAGR in the most recent periods suggests considerable underperformance compared to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $116.53
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $115.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $122.78

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.81  - Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.20 - Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +5.4  - Shows a short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500.  However, this positive divergence is contradicted by the negative CAGR in recent periods.

The expected return of -748.7% is exceptionally negative and likely an error in the data provided. It's crucial to disregard this value and focus on more reliable indicators.  Given the historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500, a long-term (2+ years) investment in PPG might not yield significant outperformance over the market, but the oversold RSI could indicate a potential short-term rebound.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's recent performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500, showing considerable underperformance in recent years. While the company maintains healthy profit margins and relatively stable revenue, the fluctuating earnings and ROE raise concerns. The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook warrants caution given the consistent underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the duplicate data entry in the earnings report is necessary before making any investment decision.  The provided -748.7% expected return is highly unreliable and should be disregarded.  The data suggests a need for a more in-depth analysis of PPG's business strategy and market positioning before considering a long-term investment.
