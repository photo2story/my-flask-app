**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period.

Given the information provided, a cautious approach is recommended.  The low projected long-term return casts doubt on the suitability of this stock for long-term investment unless a substantial improvement in growth prospects can be demonstrated.
