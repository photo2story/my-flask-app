This report analyzes PPG Industries Inc., a leading global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

PPG's cumulative return of 9.71% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return of 115.96% over the analyzed period.  The difference is -106.3%, placing it at the 2.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows a consistently low alpha (around 0.1), suggesting PPG's returns have largely tracked the market (Beta also consistently around 0.1), with limited outperformance.  The CAGR fluctuates significantly year-over-year, highlighting volatility and inconsistent performance.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures, especially in 2022-2024 (-69%), point to considerable risk.

* **Closing Price:** $119.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $120.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $123.03

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (23.15):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible, but not guaranteed.
* **PPO (-0.25):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (-0.2):** Shows a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (-1605.9%):** This extremely negative figure suggests a highly pessimistic outlook for future returns relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon. This drastic negative return requires careful investigation of its calculation and underlying assumptions. It is highly unlikely and should be treated with extreme skepticism.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data reveals some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-17).  However, based on the available information:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates around $4.5B - $4.8B, with no clear upward trend in the last four quarters.
* **EPS:** EPS shows volatility, ranging from $1.70 to $2.25. There's no consistent upward or downward trend.  The apparent inconsistency in the reported figures needs clarification.
* **Notable Beats or Misses:**  Without expected earnings figures, it's impossible to assess whether results beat or missed expectations.

**5. Financial Information:**

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or market outlook is provided.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are missing.  This section requires additional information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but this doesn't negate the significant underperformance and high risk profile (high MDD).  Recent earnings show mixed results, with no clear upward trend in revenue or EPS, and volatile profitability. The extremely negative expected return figure needs further investigation. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions hinders a complete assessment.  Currently, PPG appears to be a high-risk investment with questionable prospects compared to the broader market.  Further research is needed to understand the -1605.9% expected return figure.  More detailed financial data, recent news, and analyst sentiment are crucial for a more comprehensive evaluation.
