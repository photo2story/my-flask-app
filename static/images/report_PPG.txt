**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  Over the observed period, PPG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a cumulative return of only 5.64% compared to the S&P 500's 120.05%. This represents a substantial underperformance of -114.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 1.2% suggests that while significantly underperforming, this level of underperformance is not entirely unprecedented within the historical context of the data.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a highly variable alpha (ranging from -0.2 to 4.0) and a relatively stable beta (around 0.1-0.5, except for the last two periods).  This suggests that PPG's performance is not consistently correlated with the market (highly variable alpha), but generally exhibits low volatility relative to the market (mostly low beta). The exceptionally high alpha values in the last two years, however, warrant further investigation. The high negative CAGR in 2022-2024 (-35%) and 2023-2025 (-16%) are cause for concern.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 14.0% | 5.8% | -15.0% | 0.1 | 23.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 10.0% | 5.8% | -9.0% | 0.5 | 21.3 |
| 2017-2019  | 32.0% | 9.0% | 1.0% | 1.1 | 28.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 25.0% | 18.6% | -0.1 | 31.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 59.0% | 18.6% | -0.2 | 37.8 |
| 2020-2022  | 2.0% | 18.6% | -0.1 | 28.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 13.5% | 4.0 | 34.0 |
| 2022-2024  | -35.0% | 13.5% | 4.2 | 27.7 |
| 2023-2025  | -16.0% | 10.4% | 2.6 | 26.5 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $114.12
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $113.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.487
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $120.6433

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price change (-$0.62) also reflects this negative trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 30.31 (Oversold; potential for a bounce, but not necessarily a strong upward trend.)
* **PPO:** -0.52 (Negative; confirms bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +1.2 (Short-term upward movement relative to the S&P 500, but this is minimal given the overall context)
* **Expected Return:** -3673.0% (This extraordinarily negative figure requires verification. It is likely an error in the data provided.)

The price change reflects a minor negative movement, not a significant drop or rebound.  The extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation and likely indicates an error in the calculation or data input.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's no clear upward or downward trend, and further analysis, including comparing to previous years' data, would be needed to draw firm conclusions. Note that there is duplicate data entry for 2024-10-17.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-10-17 | 2.01 | $4.58 B      |
| 2024-07-19 | 2.25 | $4.79 B      |
| 2024-04-19 | 1.7  | $4.31 B      |
| 2023-10-19 | 1.8  | $4.64 B      |
| 2024-10-17 | 1.8  | $4.64 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability show some fluctuations. Profit margin is relatively stable, ranging from 40.74% to 43.28%, indicating consistent profitability.  ROE shows more variability, ranging from 1.15% to 6.80%, suggesting inconsistencies in the company's return on investment.  Further analysis is needed to understand these fluctuations and their underlying causes.


| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE   |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| 2024-09-30  | $4.58B   | 41.79%         | $7.79B | 6.01% |
| 2024-06-30  | $4.79B   | 42.97%         | $7.77B | 6.80% |
| 2024-03-31  | $4.31B   | 43.28%         | $7.94B | 5.04% |
| 2023-12-31  | $4.35B   | 41.82%         | $7.83B | 1.15% |
| 2023-09-30  | $4.64B   | 40.74%         | $7.75B | 5.50% |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PPG Industries Inc. has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. While the company shows consistent profitability and revenue, the recent negative CAGR values and considerable volatility in earnings and ROE are cause for concern. The stock is currently trading below its moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) suggest oversold conditions and bearish momentum.  The provided extremely negative expected return is likely erroneous.  Before making any investment decision, further in-depth analysis is strongly recommended, including comparing the data to industry benchmarks and investigating the causes of the recent significant underperformance.  The high alpha values in the last two years need further investigation to ascertain their validity and meaning.
