**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

PPG Industries Inc. presents a mixed picture. While analysts are generally bullish and the company holds a good reputation (WSJ ranking), the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence and very low expected return. Recent news about a CFO exit adds a layer of uncertainty.

The technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce, but the fundamental data is concerning. The high maximum drawdowns, negative alpha, and inconsistent revenue and ROE figures point to underlying issues.

**Recommendation:**

Given the negative divergence from the S&P 500, low expected returns, and mixed news, a *cautious* approach is warranted. While analysts have a "Buy" consensus, investors should carefully weigh the risks and potentially wait for more positive fundamental signs before making a significant investment. The recent price increase could be a good opportunity to exit a position if the investor is risk-averse.
