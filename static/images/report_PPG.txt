## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  The provided data reveals significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **PPG Cumulative Return:** 0.0%
* **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Divergence:** -82.6%
* **Relative Divergence:** 20.1% (This indicates PPG's performance is at the 20th percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500, considering the min and max divergence over the observed period).

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows a beta consistently around 1, indicating similar volatility to the market. However, the CAGR is 0% across all periods, highlighting significant underperformance.  The high negative maximum drawdown (MDD) values across all periods further underscore the risk associated with PPG during this time frame.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows relatively consistent growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $104.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $101.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $102.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $110.14

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The recent price increase of $2.26 (2.22%) from the previous close suggests a potential short-term bounce but needs further analysis to confirm.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.0 (Low Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.17 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.65 (Positive; suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -5.6% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -259.8% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises serious concerns and requires further investigation into the underlying assumptions and data used in the calculation).  The 2.26 price increase needs to be considered in context of this drastically negative long-term projection.

The significant price increase from the previous close suggests a possible short-term market reaction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, exhibiting consistent underperformance across multiple periods. While recent price action shows a short-term increase, the long-term outlook, indicated by the extremely negative expected return and the inconsistent financial results (especially the negative ROE), raises serious concerns.  The high MDD values across all observation periods further supports the risk.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for this underperformance and the validity of the provided extremely negative long-term expected return.  A thorough review of company-specific factors (e.g., industry trends, competitive landscape, operational efficiency), along with a more in-depth analysis of the provided financial statements, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data provided is insufficient to offer definitive recommendations.  Additional information and potentially different analytical methodologies are necessary for a comprehensive assessment.
