## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

The cumulative return of PPG over the analyzed period is 15.05%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which showed a cumulative return of 120.91%.  The difference is a substantial -105.9%, placing it at the 2.3rd percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500.  This indicates PPG's underperformance relative to the broader market. The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance above the market benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis; however, this positive alpha is greatly overshadowed by the substantial underperformance observed in the cumulative return.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $124.17
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $124.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $124.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $126.05

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average and very close to its 20-day moving average, suggesting a period of consolidation.  It is notably below its 60-day moving average indicating a short-term downtrend. The last market price of $124.21 doesn't signify any significant rapid upward or downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.32 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.0054 (Slightly negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +1.9 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates that, based on the provided data, no significant outperformance is expected over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) for a buy-and-hold strategy).  The low expected return reinforces the concerns regarding underperformance against the benchmark.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **EPS:** Fluctuates between $1.70 and $2.25, without a clear consistent trend.  There's no obvious pattern of continuous growth or decline.
* **Revenue:** Revenue generally hovers around $4.5B - $4.8B, showing some fluctuation but no significant consistent upward or downward trend.  The highest revenue was reported in Q2 2024.
* **Comparison:**  There's no information provided to compare these results against expectations, so we cannot assess whether the company beat or missed estimates.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins have shown some fluctuation, peaking in Q1 2024 (43.28%).  There is no clear long term trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, while ROE exhibits some variability.  The highest ROE was recorded in Q2 2024 (6.80%).  Again, there is no clearly established upward or downward trend.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided, hindering a complete assessment of market sentiment and recent developments.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While the alpha suggests some degree of risk-adjusted outperformance, the overall return heavily outweighs this positive aspect.  Recent price action suggests a period of consolidation.  Earnings show some volatility but no clear growth trend in either EPS or Revenue.  Without recent news or analyst opinions, a comprehensive assessment is limited. The provided financial data lacks a clear trend of consistent improvement. Based on the available data, a long-term investment in PPG relative to the S&P 500 carries considerable risk, given the observed underperformance and lack of robust positive financial trends. Further investigation is needed before making any investment decisions.
