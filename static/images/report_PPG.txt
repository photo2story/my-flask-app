**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, showing a large negative alpha and substantial cumulative losses.

While profit margins are generally high, recent financial data reveals concerning trends in both revenue volatility and, most importantly, a sharp decline in ROE, indicating potential underlying issues within the company's performance. The extremely negative expected return needs further investigation, and the provided earnings data requires clarification.  Before considering any investment, a thorough examination of the company's fundamentals and a more complete dataset are essential.  The -944.8% expected return is highly suspect and requires reevaluation.  The current situation warrants caution.
