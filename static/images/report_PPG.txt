## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Performance Review

**0) Overview:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  This report analyzes PPG's recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **PPG Cumulative Return:** -25.73%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.36%
* **Return Difference:** -92.09%  (PPG underperformed VOO by 92.09%)
* **Relative Underperformance:** 5.1% (This indicates PPG's underperformance is at the 5.1st percentile relative to its historical range of under/outperformance against the S&P 500, given a range of -97.4% to 7.1%).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO).  While periods of positive alpha (outperformance) exist (2015-2017, 2016-2018, 2017-2019), recent years show significant negative alpha, indicating substantial underperformance against the market benchmark. The beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements over time. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates slightly but remains relatively stable within a $20B-$40B range.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $100.73
* **5-day Moving Average:** $98.19
* **20-day Moving Average:** $106.87
* **60-day Moving Average:** $112.93

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. The recent 2.23% increase from the previous close indicates a potential short-term reversal, but the overall trend remains negative.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.71 (Suggests oversold conditions, but not necessarily a strong buy signal)
* **PPO:** -0.77 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -7.4% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -903.7% (This extremely negative expected return likely reflects the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 and should be viewed with caution.  It is not a reliable prediction of future returns.)


The 2.23% price increase from the previous close is a relatively small move in the context of the larger downtrend.  It doesn't suggest a significant "bounce" but warrants monitoring for continued price action to determine if it is a brief reversal or part of a larger trend continuation.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While revenue generally remains above $4 billion, EPS fluctuates significantly. There appears to be an error in the provided data as the 2024-10-17 entry is duplicated. A more consistent trend analysis is hampered by this duplication and the short timeframe of available data.  Further analysis requires more historical data.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-17 | 2.01 | $4.58 B     |
| 2024-07-19 | 2.25 | $4.79 B     |
| 2024-04-19 | 1.70 | $4.31 B     |
| 2023-10-19 | 1.80 | $4.64 B     |
| 2024-10-17 | 1.80 | $4.64 B     |  *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5) Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability metrics show some volatility. Revenue shows fluctuation, though generally high, and profit margins remain relatively stable at a strong level (above 40%) in recent quarters except for the latest quarter showing lower revenue and profit margin.

Equity shows a minor decline in Q4 2024, while ROE fluctuates, and even turning negative in the last quarter. More data would be needed for comprehensive analysis of these trends.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, exhibiting negative alpha and considerable price declines. While some technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the overall trend is bearish. Recent earnings show some volatility, and financial statements reveal fluctuations in key metrics.  The extremely negative projected return is unreliable and likely due to recent performance compared to the S&P 500.  More in-depth analysis considering macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and a longer timeframe is necessary for a comprehensive assessment of PPG's future prospects.  The duplicated data entry and short time frame limit the quality of the analysis.  A longer history of financial data and a more detailed industry analysis are crucial for forming a well-informed investment decision.
