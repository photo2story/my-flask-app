## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  The provided data shows PPG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The company's recent earnings and financial data require further investigation to determine the underlying reasons for this underperformance.  The negative expected return (-848.4%) is concerning and requires a detailed examination of the assumptions used in its calculation.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PPG's cumulative return of -26.06% is drastically lower than the S&P 500's 65.78% cumulative return. The significant divergence (-91.8%, placing it at the 5.4th percentile of historical relative performance) suggests substantial underperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance relative to the market (Beta).  While some periods show positive Alpha (outperformance), the recent years (2020-2025) consistently show negative Alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark. Notably, the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures highlight significant risk.  The fluctuating Beta suggests the stock's sensitivity to market movements changes over time.  The consistent negative Alpha in recent years is a serious concern.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $98.53
* **5-day Moving Average:** $97.88
* **20-day Moving Average:** $107.51
* **60-day Moving Average:** $113.20

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The significant difference between the closing price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages suggests a considerable drop in price.  The -4.44% daily change from the previous close shows a recent sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.77 (Oversold territory, but caution is warranted given the overall trend)
* **PPO:** -1.05 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -848.4% (This extremely negative figure requires careful review of the methodology. It is likely flawed or based on very pessimistic assumptions)

The technical indicators suggest a bearish market sentiment.  The large negative daily price change warrants further investigation into the potential causes of the sharp decline. The extremely negative expected return needs significant clarification and validation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of these fluctuations and their impact on the stock price.  The duplicate entry on 2024-10-17 requires clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, exhibiting consistent negative Alpha in recent years.  Recent price action shows a sharp decline, supported by bearish technical indicators. While profit margins are generally strong, recent earnings data and financial information exhibit volatility and the concerning negative ROE in Q4 2024 signals potential underlying issues. The extremely negative expected return (-848.4%) is highly improbable and needs to be re-examined.  Before considering any investment, a thorough investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and negative ROE, along with a rigorous review of the expected return calculation, is crucial.  Further analysis of industry trends and company-specific factors is required to make an informed investment decision.
