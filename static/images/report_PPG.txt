PPG's recent performance is concerning, with significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and negative technical indicators.

The extremely negative expected return calculation requires further scrutiny as it appears to be an outlier. While the MRI suggests a Medium Investment recommendation, investors should exercise caution and carefully consider the risks associated with PPG before investing. The oversold RSI may present a short-term buying opportunity, but a more fundamental analysis is needed to assess the long-term prospects of the company.
