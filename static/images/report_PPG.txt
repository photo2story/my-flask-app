## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  Over the observed period, PPG's cumulative return (15.52%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (128.86%), resulting in a substantial negative divergence. The provided data shows a current divergence of -113.3%, placing it at the 8th percentile of its historical range (relative divergence of 0.8).  The alpha consistently remains positive,  suggesting outperformance relative to the market, while the beta indicates higher volatility compared to the S&P 500.  However, the cumulative return data strongly contradicts the alpha/beta analysis, possibly indicating a recent shift in performance.  Further investigation into the reasons for this discrepancy is warranted.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $123.45
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $123.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $123.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $126.16

The stock price is slightly below its short-term moving averages (5 and 20-day), suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.  However, the difference is minimal and the stock is still relatively close to its moving averages. The 60-day moving average shows a more significant gap, indicating a further drop from recent highs.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.78 (Slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, leaning towards bearish)
* **PPO:** 0.16 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum, albeit weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.4 (+) (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This is a concerningly low expectation.  More data is needed to confirm this projection.)

The closing price of $123.44 is very close to the moving averages; hence no significant price jump or drop is observed. The low expected return raises red flags and may indicate further research is needed for a more accurate projection, particularly regarding the long-term outlook (2+ years). The relative divergence data suggests a recent short-term upward trend, but its impact on long-term projections is unclear given the low overall expected return.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show some volatility. While some quarters have shown growth in both metrics, others present declines.  A thorough analysis necessitates reviewing the quarterly reports to ascertain the underlying drivers of this variability.  The most recent EPS (2.01) and revenue ($4.58B) figures must be analyzed against analysts' expectations (if available) to get a clearer picture of the company's performance compared to its projections.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, hovering around $4.5B-$4.8B, but profit margins show some fluctuations, ranging from 40.74% to 43.28%. The drop from 42.97% in Q2 2024 to 41.79% in Q3 2024 should be investigated.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable. Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile, suggesting fluctuations in profitability.  The significant drop in ROE from Q1 2024 to Q4 2023 (5.04% to 1.15%) requires thorough analysis to determine causes.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires access to real-time news sources like Shacknews and Finbold to provide an up-to-date analysis of recent news, earnings reports, analyst opinions, and market outlook.

**7. Overall Summary:**

PPG's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the period observed. While some technical indicators suggest short-term potential upward movement, the overall picture indicates low expected returns and volatile profitability. The significant discrepancy between the consistently positive alpha and the negative cumulative return necessitates a deeper examination.  The analysis of recent financial performance, news, and analyst opinions (which are currently missing) will be crucial in determining the future outlook and investment strategy.  Current data suggests caution and thorough due diligence before investing.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the currently available data, a cautious approach is recommended. Further investigation is needed to reconcile the discrepancies between the historical alpha/beta analysis and the recent cumulative return.  Analysis of recent earnings reports and analyst opinions, along with a deeper dive into the factors driving revenue and ROE volatility, is crucial for a more informed investment decision.  Currently, the 0% expected return and lagging performance against the S&P 500 suggest that PPG might not be a favorable investment at this time compared to the broader market.
