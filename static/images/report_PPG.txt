### 3. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.329 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 46.71 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.55 (Potentially bullish if it continues to rise)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-08-18)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.0 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -4385.2% (Significantly Negative)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates a low-risk market environment overall. The RSI is neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The PPO is slightly positive.  The Hybrid Signal suggests a "Buy" recommendation (90% of available cash should be used to buy 1 share). However, the negative expected return is a major concern, indicating very poor future performance relative to the S&P 500 if investing for the long term. The recent decline in relative divergence reinforces the short-term negative trend.  The significant positive change in 'Last Market Data' price suggests a potential rebound, but needs further observation to confirm its sustainability.
