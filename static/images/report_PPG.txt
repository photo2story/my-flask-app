## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

The cumulative return of PPG (13.69%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (122.16%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -108.5%, placing it at the 2.2nd percentile of the historical range of divergence between PPG and the S&P 500.  This indicates PPG's substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting marginal outperformance relative to the market benchmark, however this is overshadowed by the overall underperformance indicated by the cumulative return.  Beta values generally range from 21 to 38, indicating higher volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $122.78
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $122.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $122.06

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, and significantly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a recent price recovery after a period of decline. The negative daily change (-$0.57) indicates a minor downward movement on the last trading day.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.13 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.89 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -2.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -1945.3% (This extremely negative figure requires further clarification.  It's likely an error or misinterpretation, and needs further investigation regarding the calculation methodology).  It is highly unlikely that a long-term investment in PPG will result in such significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.

The price change of -$0.57, while not substantial, contributes to the short-term downward trend indicated by the relative divergence. It does not suggest a sharp upward or downward movement.  The extremely negative expected return is inconsistent with other data and needs reevaluation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's recent performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500. While the company shows strong profit margins and generally stable revenue, the substantial underperformance and the highly negative (and likely erroneous) projected return raise concerns.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the significant underperformance relative to the market, the exceptionally low predicted return, and the potential errors in the provided data (duplicate earnings report, highly unrealistic expected return).  A comprehensive analysis requires a deeper dive into macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape, and a detailed review of PPG's business strategy and operational efficiency to understand the reasons for underperformance.  The current data alone does not provide a strong basis for investment recommendation.
