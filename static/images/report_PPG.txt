*   **Alpha:** The negative alpha values across all periods indicate that PPG has consistently underperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. The underperformance is particularly pronounced in recent years.
*   **Beta:** The beta values are generally low and even negative in recent years, suggesting that PPG has become less correlated with the overall market and may even move in the opposite direction. This could indicate that PPG's performance is influenced more by company-specific factors than broader market trends.
*   **CAGR & MDD:** The negative CAGR values for recent periods reflect poor returns, and the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values suggest significant volatility and potential for substantial losses.
