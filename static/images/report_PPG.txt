| 2023-2025  | -22.0%  | 80.6% | -89.0%  | -1.0  | 23.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) varies significantly, with positive growth in some periods and negative growth in others. Recent periods (2020-2025) show negative CAGR.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is high across all periods, particularly in recent years, indicating significant risk and volatility.  MDD has been consistently high.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is consistently negative, suggesting underperformance relative to the market.  The negative alpha values indicate that PPG has not been able to generate excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally low to negative, indicating lower sensitivity to market movements than the S&P 500.  This suggests that while PPG doesn't amplify market gains, it also doesn't provide much downside protection in market downturns, as evidenced by the negative alpha.
*   **Cap:** Market Cap is relatively stable.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close Price:** 104.32
*   **Previous Close:** 103.55
*   **Change:** 0.74
*   **5-day SMA:** 103.318
*   **20-day SMA:** 102.0868
*   **60-day SMA:** 100.188

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term upward trend. The positive change from the previous close reinforces this. The SMAs being relatively close together could indicate consolidation.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 66.40 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.131
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (10 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.5 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1736.9%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the other negative indicators, the MRI suggests high investment is recommended.  This is highly contradictory and should be viewed with extreme skepticism, especially given the other data points. This could be related to price fluctuations
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 66.4 is nearing the overbought threshold (typically above 70), suggesting that the stock's recent gains might be unsustainable.
*   **PPO:** The Positive Price Oscillator (PPO) is positive, indicating the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, confirming the short-term upward trend suggested by the SMAs.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends investing fully. However, this recommendation should be heavily scrutinized given the other concerning metrics.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days indicates a short-term decline, consistent with the underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-1736.9%) is a major red flag.  This suggests that, based on the data, long-term investment in PPG from this point is projected to result in significant losses compared to the S&P 500.

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~2.17)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 119.00 / 130.00 / 109.00

**Analysis:**  Analysts have a generally positive outlook, with a consensus rating of "Buy" and an average target price above the current price. However, this contrasts sharply with the negative expected return and recent underperformance. The lack of recent rating changes information makes it difficult to assess the most up-to-date analyst sentiment.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Based on the provided data, PPG Industries Inc. presents a mixed and concerning investment picture.

**Negative Aspects:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Negative Alpha:** The consistently negative Alpha indicates that PPG is not generating excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **High MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values highlight significant risk and volatility.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The projected long-term expected return of -1736.9% is a major red flag, suggesting substantial losses if invested long-term from this point.
*   **Concerning News Sentiment:** The recent news includes cautionary articles and analyses questioning PPG's performance and investment potential.

**Positive Aspects:**

*   **Recent Short-Term Upward Trend:** The stock price is currently above its short-term and medium-term SMAs, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend.
*   **Analyst "Buy" Consensus:** Analysts have a generally positive outlook with a "Buy" rating and a target price above the current price. However, this conflicts with other indicators.
*   **Relatively Stable Revenue and Profit Margin:** Revenue and profit margins have been relatively stable (excluding the one quarter dip).
*   **Positive ROE (Except One Quarter):** The generally positive ROE indicates profitability.

**Conclusion:**

The negative aspects significantly outweigh the positives. While there are some indications of a short-term upward trend and analyst optimism, the substantial underperformance, negative expected return, high risk, and cautionary news sentiment suggest that an investment in PPG Industries Inc. at this time would be highly speculative and potentially detrimental. The high MRI rating is extremely contradictory and should be treated with caution. I would **strongly advise against** investing in PPG based solely on this data. Further in-depth research and a thorough understanding of the underlying reasons for PPG's underperformance are crucial before considering any investment.
