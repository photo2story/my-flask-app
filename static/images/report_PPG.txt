## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  The cumulative return of PPG over the analyzed period is 14.77%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's cumulative return of 127.58%. The difference is -112.81%, placing it at the 1.16 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varied significantly year-over-year, indicating volatility,  Alpha consistently remains around 1.0, suggesting only marginal outperformance over the market benchmark (Beta around 1).  High maximum drawdown (MDD) values highlight the risk associated with PPG.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $122.65 (Last Market: $122.59)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $122.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $123.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $126.32

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates recent price stability, but the larger gap with the 20 and 60-day averages reinforces the bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 44.34 - This suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.07 - A negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -0.19 -  Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  This indicates that the model does not anticipate any significant excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment, considering the current context.  This is consistent with the historical underperformance.
* **Note:** The provided $122.59 price is not significantly different enough to suggest any abrupt changes like a sudden surge or crash.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue. While revenue generally remains above $4.5B, EPS fluctuates between $1.7 and $2.25.  More information, including earnings estimates, is necessary to fully assess recent performance.  The slight decrease in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 should be investigated further for underlying reasons (e.g., seasonal factors, one-time expenses).


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable but profit margins fluctuate between 40% and 43%, suggesting some variability in profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE (Return on Equity) is inconsistent, ranging from 1.15% to 6.80%, showing a fluctuating return on shareholder investment. Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind this inconsistency.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* _Requires further information._  The prompt requests analysis of recent news within the last two days from sources like Shacknews and Finbold, which isn't included in this prompt.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions,  the negative PPO and below-average moving averages indicate a bearish trend.  Profitability fluctuates, and ROE is inconsistent. The analysis requires additional information regarding recent news, analyst opinions, and earnings expectations to fully evaluate the current market outlook.
