## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

PPG Industries Inc. is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

The cumulative return of PPG (12.98%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (121.78%) over the measured period.  The difference is a substantial -108.8%.  This places PPG at the 0.3 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating significant underperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows that PPG generally exhibits a low beta (around 0.1), suggesting low correlation with the overall market.  However, the alpha values are consistently low, indicating that it hasn't significantly outperformed the market after accounting for its beta.  The CAGR fluctuates significantly, highlighting considerable volatility in returns.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) also shows periods of substantial losses.  The recent negative CAGR (-32%) is particularly concerning.

* **Relative Divergence:** The recent 20-day relative divergence of -2.1 points to a short-term downward trend.

This is consistent with the historical alpha data.  Given the current price is below the moving averages and the negative PPO, a short-term upward bounce can't be ruled out, but sustained upward growth remains uncertain.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce from oversold conditions, overall technical indicators and the recent negative CAGR paint a bearish picture. The company's recent earnings show some volatility without a clear upward trend.  The low beta suggests lower market risk but also limits potential for significant outperformance.  Overall, based on the provided data, PPG presents a high-risk investment with limited upside potential relative to the broader market, at least in the short to medium term.  More information (analyst opinions, recent news, and earnings expectations) is needed to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
