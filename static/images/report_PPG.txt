**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $99.61
* **Previous Close:** $101.48
* **Change:** -$1.87 (a significant daily drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $100.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $105.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.31

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend. The recent significant drop warrants further investigation into potential market catalysts.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.97 (suggests oversold conditions, but not a strong buy signal alone)
* **PPO:** -0.36 (negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.2% (indicates a recent short-term weakening trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term, >2 years):** -925.9%  This extremely negative value suggests a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This number seems implausibly low and requires review of the calculation methodology. A more reasonable expectation would depend on future market conditions and PPG's performance.


The large negative price change (-$1.87) reflects a significant daily drop, which should prompt further analysis to identify the causes of this drop.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly. Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, although the RSI hints at potential oversold conditions.  Recent earnings are volatile, and the financial statements show a concerning decline in ROE. The extremely low expected return figure (-925.9%) needs clarification.  Before any investment decision, a thorough investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and the sustainability of the current financial trends is crucial. The high profit margins suggest some underlying strength, but the negative ROE and underperformance against the market are significant warning signs.  Further research is needed to determine if the current price presents a buying opportunity or if the negative trends will continue.
