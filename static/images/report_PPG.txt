## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  Over the past period, PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting negative cumulative returns while the market showed strong positive growth.  Recent financial data shows mixed results with declining revenue in the most recent quarter but relatively high profit margins.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition but significant risks remain.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PPG's cumulative return of -25.36% significantly lags the S&P 500's return of 66.94%. The divergence is -92.3%, placing it at the 4.9th percentile of its historical range (-97.4% to 7.1%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market. While showing positive alpha in some periods (indicating outperformance), it consistently displays negative alpha in recent years, highlighting underperformance against the market benchmark.  The beta values generally range from 0.1 to 0.8, suggesting moderate market sensitivity. The significant drop in CAGR and increase in MDD in the last two years is particularly concerning.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 17.0% | 5.8% | -13.0% | 0.1 | 23.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 8.0% | 60.6% | -9.0% | 0.2 | 20.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 30.0% | 60.6% | 1.0% | 0.8 | 27.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 21.0% | 60.6% | -5.0% | -0.2 | 30.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 52.0% | 57.5% | -3.0% | -0.3 | 36.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -5.0% | 66.4% | -11.0% | -0.7 | 27.3 |
| 2021-2023  | -8.0% | 66.4% | -25.0% | -0.2 | 33.1 |
| 2022-2024  | -44.0% | 73.0% | -60.0% | -0.0 | 27.0 |
| 2023-2025  | -35.0% | 80.0% | 2.4 | 23.4 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $103.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $98.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $108.15
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $113.49

The price is below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent price increase from $91.66 to $103.11 represents a significant daily jump (12.49).  This could be interpreted as a sharp rebound, potentially indicating a short-term bullish reversal, but further confirmation is needed.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.31 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -1.17 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -940.7% (This extremely negative value suggests a significant risk, and possibly an error in the calculation. Further clarification is needed on the methodology used).


The significant price jump warrants caution. While oversold conditions may exist based on RSI, the negative PPO and high MRI indicate substantial risk. The extremely negative expected return needs further investigation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-17 | 2.01  | $4.58 B       |
| 2024-07-19 | 2.25  | $4.79 B       |
| 2024-04-19 | 1.70  | $4.31 B       |
| 2023-10-19 | 1.80  | $4.64 B       |
| 2024-10-17 | 1.80  | $4.64 B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Revenue shows some volatility, with a recent decline in the last quarter. EPS also fluctuates but generally shows a decline from Q2 2024. The duplicate entry requires clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.17B | 34.87% |
| 2024-09-30 | $4.58B | 41.79% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.79B | 42.97% |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.31B | 43.28% |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.35B | 41.82% |

Profit margins remain relatively high despite the recent revenue decline. The significant drop in revenue for Q4 2024 needs further investigation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $6.79B | -4.13% |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.79B | 6.01% |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.77B | 6.80% |
| 2024-03-31 | $7.94B | 5.04% |
| 2023-12-31 | $7.83B | 1.15% |

ROE shows significant volatility.  The negative ROE in Q4 2024 is a major concern and needs explanation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500 in recent years.  While profit margins remain relatively strong, recent revenue decline and negative ROE are alarming.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the high market risk indicator and extremely negative projected return signal considerable caution.  The recent price jump could be a short-term rebound, but it is too early to call a definitive trend reversal.  Further investigation into the reasons for the Q4 2024 revenue and ROE decline, and clarification on the expected return calculation, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough due diligence process is recommended before considering any investment in PPG.
