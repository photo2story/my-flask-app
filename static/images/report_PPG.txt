**0. Key Figures Summary:**

PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) is a global leader in the manufacture and sale of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  The provided data shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, alongside mixed signals regarding recent financial performance and market indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PPG's cumulative return (-20.85%) significantly lags the S&P 500's return (76.18%), resulting in a large negative divergence (-97.0).  The relative divergence of 7.2 indicates that PPG's underperformance is in the lower 7.2% percentile of historical relative performance compared to VOO.

While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market),  recent years (especially 2021-2025) show significantly negative alpha, suggesting underperformance against the market benchmark during these timeframes.  The high and volatile Beta values indicate PPG is significantly affected by market fluctuations.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $100.05
* **5-day Moving Average:** $100.06
* **20-day Moving Average:** $104.26
* **60-day Moving Average:** $111.53

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent increase (1.66) from the previous close indicates a potential short-term bounce, but the overall trend appears weak.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.89 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.14 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** 1.9 (+), indicating a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -672.7% This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is alarming and needs further investigation.  The data suggests a high level of risk and potential for significant further underperformance in the long term.  This negative return figure warrants deep scrutiny into what this number encompasses and its underlying assumptions.


The price change of 1.66%, while positive, isn't significant enough to classify as a dramatic rebound. The negative expected return, however, is a major red flag.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue        |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2024-10-17 | 2.01  | $4.58 B        |
| 2024-07-19 | 2.25  | $4.79 B        |
| 2024-04-19 | 1.7   | $4.31 B        |
| 2023-10-19 | 1.8   | $4.64 B        |
| 2024-10-17 | 1.8   | $4.64 B        | *(Duplicate entry?)*


Earnings are volatile, showing some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  The duplicate entry for October 17th, 2024 needs clarification.  A deeper analysis including comparisons to previous years and industry benchmarks is needed to draw definitive conclusions.

| 2023-12-31 | $7.83B    | 1.15%         |

Profit margins are generally strong and consistent. However, the negative ROE in Q4 2024 is concerning and requires further investigation.  The data suggests some potential inconsistencies or errors that need to be rectified.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance is significantly lagging the S&P 500, indicated by a large negative divergence and negative alpha in recent periods. While some financial metrics (profit margins) appear healthy, the negative ROE, volatile earnings, and significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 paint a concerning picture. The bearish technical indicators further support this negative outlook.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the source data, the -672.7% expected return figure, and the duplicate earnings data entry is crucial. The information provided raises serious concerns about the companyâ€™s current financial health and future prospects.  A more detailed fundamental analysis is required to assess the long-term viability of PPG.
