## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  Recent performance shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, marked by negative returns and volatile financial indicators.  A deeper dive into the provided data is needed to assess the long-term investment potential.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PPG's cumulative return of -6.02% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 85.44%. The provided divergence metrics highlight this underperformance, placing PPG at -91.5% relative to the S&P 500, representing the 12th percentile of its historical range of divergence.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance across the analyzed periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), most recent years (2020-2025) exhibit high negative alpha and high beta (high volatility), suggesting significant underperformance and heightened market sensitivity. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates but remains in a relatively stable range.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2017-2019  | 29.0% | 45.2% | 10.0% | -0.6 | 27.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 29.0% | 45.2% | -5.0% | -0.5 | 30.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 63.0% | 19.5% | -0.6 | 27.5 | 36.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

PPG's current price is $103.99, a significant decrease from the previous close of $110.11 (-5.56%).  The moving averages indicate a downtrend:

* 5-day moving average: $107.97
* 20-day moving average: $111.34
* 60-day moving average: $114.59

The price is below all three moving averages, reinforcing the bearish trend.  The substantial price drop of -5.56% suggests a possible market event driving this decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk) suggests moderate market volatility.
* **RSI (27.68):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce but not confirming an upward trend.
* **PPO (-0.44):** A negative value signifies a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent increase of 3.4 points suggests short-term upward momentum, potentially contradicting the long-term trend.
* **Expected Return (-287.3%):** This extremely negative expected return, relative to the S&P 500, over the long term (2+ years) is a major concern. This needs further investigation to understand the assumptions behind this calculation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's current situation presents a mixed picture. While the company boasts high profit margins historically, recent performance indicates significant underperformance relative to the market (S&P 500), substantial price decline, and volatile financial indicators.  The negative expected return is a major red flag.  The inconsistencies in alpha and beta across different periods highlight the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future.  Further investigation is needed to determine the drivers behind the recent price drop and the sustainability of its profitability.  Considering the high negative expected return and the overall volatility, a cautious approach is warranted before investing.  A thorough analysis of the company's long-term strategy, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated entry in the earnings data also needs clarification.
