    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is generally positive in the earlier periods (2015-2019), but negative in more recent periods (2018-2025). This indicates a weakening performance trend.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is very high in all periods except 2015-2017 indicating big losses in the period.
    *   **Alpha:** The consistently negative Alpha suggests that PPG has underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) during these periods.  A negative alpha means the investment's return was worse than expected for the risk taken.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values, which have become increasingly negative, show that the stock price is inversely correlated with the market (S&P 500).
    *   **Cap(B):** The Market Cap in Billions is fluctuating in range.

*   20-day SMA: 102.46
*   60-day SMA: 100.17

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA, suggesting possible short-term downward momentum. The 5-day SMA is higher than the 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 60-day SMA, indicating a recent upward trend, but the proximity of the averages suggests some potential consolidation or volatility.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Market Risk Indicators**

*   RSI: 73.48 (Overbought)
*   PPO: 0.0654

*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -2.2 (Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return (%): -2267.9 (Very negative expected return compared to the S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but this is contradicted by several other indicators.
    *   The RSI indicates that the stock is currently overbought, suggesting a potential pullback.
    *   The PPO, while positive, needs to be interpreted with caution given the longer-term negative trends.
    *   The Hybrid Signal leans toward buying, but consider the MRI and other data together.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms recent short-term weakness.
    *   The *extremely* negative Expected Return suggests a very pessimistic outlook for long-term performance relative to the S&P 500.

*   **Overbought Condition:** The high RSI indicates the stock might be overbought in the short term, increasing the risk of a pullback.
*   **Contradictory Indicators:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but the negative Expected Return, negative divergence, and high RSI contradict this.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Data:** The strong analyst consensus conflicts with the negative trends observed in the financial data and market indicators.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach to PPG Industries is warranted. While analysts are optimistic, the data reveals significant underperformance and potential risks. Before making any investment decisions, it is crucial to:

*   **Investigate the Analyst Rationale:** Understand why analysts have a "Buy" rating despite the negative financial trends.
*   **Analyze the Q4 2024 ROE Dip:** Determine the cause of the negative ROE in Q4 2024 and assess its impact on future profitability.
*   **Evaluate Future Growth Prospects:** Assess PPG's future growth prospects and its ability to improve its financial performance.
*   **Consider Alternative Investments:** Compare PPG's potential returns and risks with those of other investments in the same sector or the broader market.
