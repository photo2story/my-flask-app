## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PPG Industries Inc. is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

The cumulative return of PPG over the unspecified period is 6.30%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which shows a cumulative return of 112.47%.  The provided data indicates a substantial lag of -106.2 percentage points, placing it at the 4.2 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This suggests considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals mixed results across different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), the most recent period (2022-2025) demonstrates significant negative CAGR and high Maximum Drawdown (MDD), indicating substantial underperformance and high risk. The consistently low beta (around 0.1) suggests low correlation with the overall market. However, the volatile CAGR figures highlight significant risk associated with PPG.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $114.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $114.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $122.9986

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 34.68 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce, but not a strong buy signal on its own.)
* **PPO:** -0.39 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +4.2 (Short-term upward movement relative to the S&P 500, though this is in the context of substantial underperformance.)
* **Expected Return:** -978.8% (This extremely negative expected return needs clarification.  It's highly improbable and likely reflects an error in the calculation or data input.  A long-term, two-year investment horizon is recommended.)

The closing price of $114.80 doesn't inherently signify a sharp reversal.  Further analysis is needed to determine whether the current price represents a buying opportunity or continued downward pressure.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been significantly underwhelming, particularly in recent years. While the company shows generally strong revenue and profit margins, the volatile EPS, fluctuating ROE, and negative CAGR in the recent period raise concerns. The oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and overall underperformance against the market indicate a bearish outlook. The extremely negative expected return figure requires further investigation and clarification.  More comprehensive fundamental and technical analysis is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Caution is advised.  The -978.8% expected return is unrealistic and needs correction.
