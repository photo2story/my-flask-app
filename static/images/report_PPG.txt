**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

The substantial negative divergence highlights the underperformance relative to the broader market.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show a mixed performance compared to the market.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others show negative alpha (underperformance). The beta is consistently high, indicating a higher sensitivity to market fluctuations than the average stock.  The high beta is also evident in the large swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) between periods.  The dramatic negative CAGR in the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods shows significant vulnerability to market downturns.  Noteworthy is the incredibly high alpha in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 which needs further investigation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 36.58 (Approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce, but also suggesting caution).
* **PPO:** 0.0984 (Positive, but very close to zero which needs to be interpreted in the context of the overall trend).

* **Expected Return:** -1738.4% (This extremely negative value needs clarification.  Is this a miscalculation?  The context of this number is crucial for interpretation.)  The very small change of -0.14 in the price is not a significant enough movement to consider a "sudden jump" or "sudden fall."

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG Industries has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While the company shows high profit margins, its earnings and ROE exhibit some volatility.  The high beta suggests high sensitivity to market movements, making it a riskier investment.  The extremely low expected return (-1738.4%) needs further clarification and likely indicates a calculation error.  Technical indicators suggest a possible short-term bounce but don't signal a strong uptrend.  Further investigation is needed to understand the large swings in CAGR and high alpha values for some periods.  A deep dive into industry factors, competitive landscape, and the specifics of the -1738.4% expected return are necessary for a comprehensive assessment.  Given the current data, a cautious approach is advised.  The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raises serious concerns regarding investment potential unless a strong justification for the deviation exists.
