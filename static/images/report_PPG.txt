**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate has been volatile, ranging from -31% to +19%.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown has been significant in recent periods (close to 80%).
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha values indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500). In other words, PPG is generating less return than expected for the risk taken.
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate. Some are slightly positive (indicating a tendency to move in the same direction as the market), but most are negative, indicating an inverse relationship with the market, but negative Betas for positive CAGR periods don't make sense.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated over time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 102.91
*   **Previous Close:** 103.72

*   **5-day SMA:** 103.518
*   **20-day SMA:** 100.7848
*   **60-day SMA:** 100.264

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA but above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a short-term downtrend, with some potential for continued volatility as the shorter SMA is above the current price, while the 20 and 60 day SMAs support current price levels.

*   **The extremely negative expected return is very concerning and should be investigated further.**

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

PPG Industries is a company facing mixed signals.

*   **Negative Factors:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 with a substantial negative divergence. The alpha and beta analysis highlights consistent underperformance and increased volatility in recent periods. Most concerning is the extremely negative expected return, though I question the calculation of this figure.
*   **Positive Factors:** Recent news and analyst ratings are largely positive, with several firms issuing buy recommendations and raising price targets. The analyst consensus is a buy, with a target price significantly higher than the current price. The company's financials show stable revenue and strong profit margins. The MRI indicates medium investment risk.
*   **Neutral Factors:** The short-term technical indicators are mixed, with a potential pullback indicated by RSI.

**Conclusion:**

The data presents a conflicting picture. While analyst sentiment and recent news are positive, the historical performance and expected return (if accurate) are major red flags. A deeper dive into the methodology used to calculate the expected return and the reasons behind the underperformance is crucial before making any investment decision. The positive analyst sentiment and financial stability might suggest a potential turnaround story, but caution is warranted given the negative historical trends.
