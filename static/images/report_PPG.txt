*   **Alpha:** The negative alpha values across all periods indicate that PPG has consistently underperformed its expected return based on its beta.  The underperformance has become increasingly severe in recent years.
*   **Beta:** The beta values, especially in recent periods, are negative.  This suggests an inverse relationship with the market, which is unusual. A negative beta means PPG tends to move in the opposite direction of the S&P 500. This could point to defensive characteristics, but given the underperformance, it's more likely due to company-specific issues.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown values are very high, indicating significant peak-to-trough declines in PPG's value over the periods.

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** 0.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -7055.1% (Expected excess return over S&P 500 with long-term investment)

*   **RSI:** The RSI indicates that the stock is oversold, which could suggest a potential for a short-term bounce.
*   **PPO:** Negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** A buy rating could mean that it is a good time to invest in the company
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests severe concerns about PPG's future performance relative to the S&P 500.

### 7. Overall Analysis and Conclusion

PPG Industries presents a mixed picture. While analyst consensus is "Buy" and a recent partnership is a positive catalyst, several factors raise concerns:

*   **Significant Underperformance:** PPG has drastically underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Alpha and Beta:** The negative alpha indicates poor risk-adjusted returns, and the negative beta, while unusual, doesn't seem to be helping performance.
*   **Technical Weakness:** Price is below moving averages, RSI is oversold.
*   **Mixed News:** While there is a partnership, other headlines are concerning.
*   **Earnings Volatility:** EPS, Revenue, and ROE have fluctuated.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The model predicts a very negative long-term return relative to the market.

**Overall, the analysis suggests a cautious approach to PPG.** While a short-term bounce is possible due to the oversold conditions, the underlying issues and negative sentiment suggest significant risks. It would be prudent to wait for more positive signals (e.g., improved earnings, positive analyst revisions, and a reversal of the underperformance trend) before considering a long-term investment.
