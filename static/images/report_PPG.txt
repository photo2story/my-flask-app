2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of PPG Industries (PPG), incorporating all the data you provided:

**0) PPG Industries Inc. Overview:** PPG Industries Inc. is a global supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (PPG vs. VOO):**

*   **PPG Cumulative Return:** -36.39%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** -129.2
*   **Relative Divergence:** 4.0

**Analysis:** PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period. The large negative divergence indicates a substantial difference in returns. The relative divergence of 4.0 suggests that this underperformance is near its worst point compared to historical data.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | -4.0%  | 15.2%  | -8.0%   | 1.0  | 23.1   |
| 2017-2019  | 15.0%  | 15.2%  | -2.0%   | 0.9  | 30.1   |
| 2018-2020  | -18.0% | 40.1%  | -38.0%  | 0.9  | 32.5   |
| 2019-2021  | 12.0%  | 40.1%  | -31.0%  | 1.0  | 38.9   |
| 2020-2022  | -18.0% | 38.1%  | -16.0%  | 1.0  | 28.4   |
| 2021-2023  | -2.0%  | 29.1%  | -3.0%   | 1.1  | 33.8   |
| 2022-2024  | -31.0% | 26.5%  | -51.0%  | 1.0  | 27.0   |
| 2023-2025  | -23.0% | 29.3%  | -85.0%  | 0.9  | 23.1   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is negative for most periods, reflecting poor performance.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown indicates significant potential losses in each period.
*   **Alpha:** The consistently negative alpha suggests PPG is underperforming its benchmark index. This means that even after adjusting for market risk (beta), PPG is generating lower returns.  The Alpha is becoming increasingly negative in more recent periods, signaling worsening relative performance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values hover around 1, indicating that PPG's price generally moves in line with the market (S&P 500). A beta slightly above 1 (1.1 in 2021-2023) suggests it might be slightly more volatile than the market, while a beta below 1 (0.9) suggests it is slightly less volatile.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 104.35
*   **Previous Close:** 102.46
*   **Change:** 1.84
*   **5-day SMA:** 103.81
*   **20-day SMA:** 102.68
*   **60-day SMA:** 100.24

**Analysis:**  PPG's current price is above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This *could* suggest a short-term upward trend. The recent price increase of 1.84 from the previous close supports this idea.

**3) RSI, PPO Index and Market Risk Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 59.00
*   **PPO:** -0.02
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (10 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 1.1 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1599.2%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.8 indicates a "Medium Investment Recommended" rating.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 59.00 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), but isn't there yet. It suggests increasing buying pressure.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -0.02 is close to zero, suggesting the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests to use all available cash to buy PPG.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence (1.1) aligns with the short-term upward trend suggested by the moving averages.
*   **Expected Return (%):** The extremely negative expected return (-1599.2%) is a major red flag. It suggests the model anticipates very significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news headlines present a mixed picture.
    *   Some articles discuss PPG's recent stock performance in relation to its financials (neutral/analytical).
    *   Others focus on analyst price targets and ratings, with Citigroup expecting the stock price to rise (positive).
    *   Some articles like "Why You Shouldn’t Be Buying PPG Industries Stock" suggest caution (negative).
    *   Another article notes poor performance in 2025 but anticipates improvement in 2026 (mixed).
    * One article analyzes how Fed policy supports PPG stock (positive).

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.17 (~Buy)
*   **Target Price:** $119.00 (Avg) / $130.00 (High) / $109.00 (Low)

**Analysis:**  The analyst consensus is generally positive (Buy rating, average rating ~Buy).  The average target price of $119.00 represents a potential upside from the current price of $104.35. *However*, it is important to consider that target prices are *expectations* and not guarantees.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-10-29 | 2.01 | 4.08 B$     |
| 2025-07-30 | 1.98 | 4.20 B$     |
| 2025-04-30 | 1.63 | 3.68 B$     |
| 2024-10-17 | 2.01 | 4.03 B$     |
| 2025-10-29 | 2.01 | 4.03 B$     |

**Analysis:**

*   EPS has shown some fluctuation, with a dip in 2025-04-30 and a recovery.
*   Revenue has also fluctuated, with the highest revenue in 2025-07-30. It's important to look for trends in EPS and revenue growth (or decline) over a longer period. The fact that 2024-10-17 and 2025-10-29 data is identical suggests a possible data error.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Underperformance:** PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative alpha across the period indicates consistent underperformance relative to its benchmark.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Recent stock price movement shows a potential short-term upward trend. The RSI indicates increasing buying pressure but is not yet overbought. The PPO is neutral.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Model Pessimism:** Analysts have a generally positive outlook with a "Buy" consensus and a potential upside based on target prices. However, the model projects a very negative expected return, suggesting substantial long-term underperformance.
*   **Earnings and Financial Health:** Earnings have fluctuated, and revenue saw a dip in 2024. Profit margins are generally good. Equity has increased.
*   **News Sentiment:** Recent news articles show mixed sentiment, with some positive analyst ratings but also articles warning against buying the stock.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a conflicting picture. The strong underperformance compared to the S&P 500, very negative expected return, and mixed news sentiment suggest *caution*. While analysts are generally positive and there are some indications of a short-term upward trend, the underlying financial performance and relative performance issues are concerning.

**Therefore, based on this data, a neutral to slightly negative outlook on PPG is warranted.** Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and the validity of the model's negative projection is recommended before making any investment decisions. Pay particular attention to future earnings reports and any significant company announcements. The inconsistent data (duplicate rows in the earnings data) also raise concerns about data quality and should be clarified.
