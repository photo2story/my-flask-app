## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  The cumulative return of PPG over the analyzed period is 11.69%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a 114.36% return. The divergence is -102.7%, placing it at the 5.6th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently low beta (around 0.1) indicating low correlation with the overall market.  While Alpha is consistently positive, suggesting some outperformance, it's relatively small and hasn't been enough to offset the market's significant gains.  The CAGR fluctuates significantly, highlighting volatility in performance across different periods. The high maximum drawdown (MDD) in some periods underlines substantial risk.  The large negative CAGR in 2022-2024 is particularly concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $121.25
* **5-day Moving Average:** $122.83
* **20-day Moving Average:** $124.13
* **60-day Moving Average:** $126.20

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (42.59):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 50), potentially suggesting a bounce, but not a strong buy signal.
* **PPO (-0.25):** Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+5.6):**  Suggests a recent short-term upward price movement.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The projected long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500 is 0%, indicating no significant outperformance is expected given the current situation.  The current price of $121.25, below the moving averages, doesn't suggest immediate 급반등 (sharp rebound). However, it's not necessarily indicative of an imminent 급하락 (sharp drop) either, given the RSI approaching oversold levels.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue fluctuates, showing no consistent growth trend.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS is inconsistent; it's not possible to identify a clear pattern without additional context and expectations. There is an apparent duplication of data for 2024-10-17, which needs clarification.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, showing a substantial negative divergence.

Earnings data reveals inconsistent performance with fluctuating revenue and EPS, without clear growth trends.  The lack of consistent growth and significant underperformance against the market raises concerns. A long-term investment in PPG, based on the provided data, doesn't show a compelling case for outperformance over the S&P 500. More information regarding recent news, analyst opinions, and a comparison to earnings expectations is needed for a complete assessment.
