## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Performance Review

This report analyzes the performance of PPG Industries Inc., a leading global supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PPG's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.

* **PPG Cumulative Return:** 6.27%
* **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 118.31%
* **Return Difference:** -112.04%
* **Relative Divergence:** 3.2% (This indicates PPG's performance is relatively low compared to the S&P 500, falling within the lower 3.2% of its historical performance relative to the index.)


The provided alpha and beta analysis shows mixed results across different periods. While some periods exhibit positive alpha (outperformance), suggesting periods of outperformance relative to the market, recent years (2022-2025) show significantly negative CAGR and high beta (market sensitivity), indicating underperformance and high volatility.  The consistently high beta suggests PPG's returns are heavily influenced by broader market trends.  The market cap has fluctuated around $27B - $37B during the observation periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $114.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $117.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $119.88

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price change (-$2.06) indicates a relatively sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.73 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.15 (Slightly positive, suggesting a potential upward momentum, but weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.6 (Short-term upward trend, but very weak and context dependent)
* **Expected Return:** -1351.3% (This extremely negative value suggests a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).  This warrants further investigation into the basis of this projection.)


The large negative change in the last market day (-$2.06) reflects the short-term negative trend.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-17 | 2.01   | $4.58B       |
| 2024-07-19 | 2.25   | $4.79B       |

| 2024-10-17 | 1.80   | $4.64B       | *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*


Revenue fluctuates around $4.5B, but EPS shows some volatility.  There appears to be a duplicate entry for October 17th, 2024.  This data needs further clarification to draw reliable conclusions about earnings trends.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $2.17B   | 34.87%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $4.58B   | 41.79%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $4.79B   | 42.97%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $4.31B   | 43.28%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $4.35B   | 41.82%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE      |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| 2024-12-31  | $6.79B   | -4.13%   |
| 2024-09-30  | $7.79B   | 6.01%    |
| 2024-06-30  | $7.77B   | 6.80%    |
| 2024-03-31  | $7.94B   | 5.04%    |
| 2023-12-31  | $7.83B   | 1.15%    |

Profit margins are consistently high, suggesting good profitability. However, ROE shows significant volatility, including a negative ROE in Q4 2024. This requires further investigation to determine the underlying causes. The significant drop in revenue and equity in Q4 2024 warrants further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, exhibiting high beta and low cumulative return. While profitability margins remain strong, recent earnings and financial data show volatility and a concerning drop in Q4 2024. The negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a major red flag. The -1351.3% expected return is an outlier and needs further verification.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough investigation into the reasons behind the Q4 2024 downturn, the highly negative expected return projection, and the duplicate earnings data entry is crucial.  Additional fundamental and qualitative analysis is necessary to assess the long-term viability and investment potential of PPG.
