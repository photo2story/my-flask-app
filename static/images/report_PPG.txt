**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-10-29 | 2.01 | 4.08 B$   |

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

PPG Industries Inc. has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial negative cumulative return and a high degree of divergence. The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistent underperformance and negative correlation with the market. Recent news headlines point to concerns about potential price declines and underperformance relative to its sector. The MRI indicates a medium level of investment risk, while the RSI suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory. The expected return is extremely negative, which indicates that investment in PPG will significantly underperform compared to the S&P 500. Recent earnings and financial data show fluctuating revenue and relatively stable EPS, with strong profit margins and increasing equity. Analyst opinions remain generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus and a target price indicating potential upside. However, this is tempered by the negative technical indicators and underperformance.

**Overall Conclusion:**

While PPG exhibits some financial strengths (strong profit margins, increasing equity), the overwhelming negative performance indicators and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raise significant concerns. While analyst ratings suggest potential upside, investors should carefully consider the risks and negative trends before investing in PPG. The leadership transition and strategic shifts could potentially be positive catalysts, but their impact remains to be seen.
