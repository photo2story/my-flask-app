**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 55.49  -  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions; the stock is in a neutral zone.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.14 - A positive value suggests a bullish trend, albeit weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.53 - Shows a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 0.0% -  The provided data doesn't offer a specific long-term expected return beyond the statement that it is 0% compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This requires further analysis and consideration of various market factors.  Given the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 historically, a positive long-term outlook is unlikely without significant changes in the company's performance.
* **Current Price:**  The current price of $125.79 does not indicate a recent sharp upward or downward movement based solely on this data.  Further investigation into intraday price movements would be needed to confirm this.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and Revenue data show some volatility.  There is no information about the consensus estimate for the most recent quarter (2024-10-17) to compare against the reported earnings.  A thorough analysis would require access to analyst estimates and detailed financial statements. The revenue fluctuates around $4.5 Billion - $4.8 Billion per quarter.  Further analysis is needed to determine the long-term performance and prospects of the company.


**5. Quarterly Financial Data Analysis:**

**(1) Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable, hovering around $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion over the past few quarters. Profit margins show some fluctuation, ranging from 40.74% to 43.28%, suggesting consistency but not significant growth.

**(2) Capital and Profitability:**  Equity is relatively stable, but Return on Equity (ROE) shows volatility, indicating fluctuating profitability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  The provided data lacks information on recent news (within the last two days), earnings announcements beyond the EPS and Revenue data, analyst opinions, market outlook, and any other performance highlights from sources like Shacknews or Finbold.  To obtain this information a search of financial news websites would be necessary.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG Industries shows mixed performance.  While the recent short-term indicators suggest some positive momentum, the long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is significant.  Profitability is inconsistent, and more in-depth analysis is needed to assess the future prospects and value proposition of PPG. The lack of recent news, analyst opinions, and more complete financial data hinders a comprehensive evaluation. Additional research is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided 0% long-term expected return requires significant additional analysis and should be viewed with caution.


**8. Recommendations:**

Further research is needed to thoroughly assess PPG Industries.  This should include:

* **In-depth financial statement analysis:** Analyze balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements for a more comprehensive view.
* **Industry and competitive analysis:**  Compare PPG's performance with competitors to understand its market position.
* **Analyst reports and earnings calls:**  Review analyst opinions and listen to earnings calls for insights into management's outlook and strategic plans.
* **Macroeconomic factors:** Evaluate the impact of macroeconomic conditions (e.g., inflation, interest rates) on PPG's business.

Only after completing this additional research can a well-informed investment decision be made regarding PPG Industries.
