2025-12-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) based on the data provided:

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** PPG Industries Inc. is a global supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.
*   **Performance Divergence:** PPG's cumulative return (-39.68%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) return (100.58%). The divergence is a substantial -142.7, positioning it at the bottom 2.2% relative to its historical divergence range. This indicates a very negative relative performance.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   The Alpha values are consistently negative, indicating underperformance relative to the market.
    *   The Beta values fluctuate but are generally negative.  A negative beta suggests PPG's price tends to move *inversely* to the market, although the values are close to zero. It means it is less influenced by market movements and not the inverse relationship.
    *   CAGR has been inconsistent, even negative in recent periods.
    *   MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is very high in recent periods.

**Interpretation:** PPG has severely underperformed the S&P 500. The negative Alpha suggests value destruction, and high MDD signifies substantial risk and potential losses. The Beta is close to zero so it is hard to interpret.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** \$101.34
*   **Last Market Activity:** Price increased by \$0.36 compared to the previous close.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: \$100.55
    *   20-day SMA: \$97.50
    *   60-day SMA: \$101.51

**Interpretation:** The stock is slightly above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below its 60-day moving average. This suggests short-term upward momentum, but it is still struggling to regain its longer-term average. The stock price is fluctuating.

**3) Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 63.3 (Approaching overbought territory, but not yet there).
*   **PPO:** 0.83 (Positive, indicating that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, suggesting an upward trend).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends investing 100% of cash into the stock, but this is a very safe strategy with a high MRI (0.90). It also suggests a small monthly investment.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:**  A recent decrease in relative divergence (-4.2) indicates a short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** Very negative (-3263.7%), suggesting significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term.

**Interpretation:**  The MRI suggests a medium investment level, but the extremely negative expected return tempers this. The RSI and PPO offer conflicting signals, suggesting potential short-term gains but substantial long-term risks. The divergence change confirms recent weakness.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Headlines:** The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   Some articles discuss analyst predictions for future stock performance.
    *   Others analyze the impact of macro factors, leadership transitions, and institutional ownership.
    *   One headline highlights PPG's underperformance compared to its sector.

**Interpretation:**  The news coverage is diverse, with some articles presenting bullish viewpoints while others raise concerns about underperformance and potential challenges. The CFO transition and analysis of macro factors driving the stock suggest that the company is experiencing some internal and external changes.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.17)
*   **Target Price:** Average target price is \$118.45, indicating an upside potential.

**Interpretation:** Analysts, on average, have a positive outlook on PPG, with a "Buy" consensus and a target price significantly above the current price. However, without knowing the *timing* of these ratings, it's difficult to assess their current relevance.

**Interpretation:** Revenue has been somewhat inconsistent, with a significant dip in Q4 2024. Profit margins are generally healthy, hovering around 40%. Equity has been relatively stable, and ROE (Return on Equity) is positive but fluctuates. The negative ROE in Q4 2024 is concerning.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

PPG Industries is underperforming significantly compared to the S&P 500, with an extremely negative expected return. Its Alpha is consistently negative. Financial performance shows inconsistent revenue and fluctuating ROE. While analysts have a generally positive outlook, the technical indicators and recent news suggest potential short-term weakness and long-term risks. The high MDD and the fact that it is at the bottom of divergence with S&P500 suggest a high risky profile of the stock. Given the negative expected return and divergence from the S\&P 500, caution is advised regarding long-term investment in PPG at this time.
