    *   The Beta values are generally low or negative. Low Beta stocks are typically less volatile than the market, while negative beta values means the stock tends to move in the opposite direction of the market.
    *   CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of positive growth (2015-2019) followed by periods of negative growth (2018-2025).
    *   MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is very high in recent periods (2016-2025), suggesting significant risk and volatility.
    *   The Capacity figures, which represent assets under management in Billions of USD, remains fairly stable.

    **In short:** PPG has shown consistent underperformance compared to the market, particularly in recent years. This underperformance is reflected in the negative Alpha and relatively low/negative Beta values. The high MDD values highlight the stock's increased volatility and risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** $103.70
*   **5-day SMA:** 102.83
*   **20-day SMA:** 99.91
*   **60-day SMA:** 100.35

**3) RSI, PPO and Other Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment). This suggests a moderate level of risk based on the MRI model.
*   **RSI:** 73.59. This indicates that PPG is currently overbought, suggesting a potential pullback in the near term. RSI values above 70 are generally considered overbought.
*   **PPO:** 0.54. The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) measures the momentum of a stock. A positive PPO can indicate upward momentum, however, given the other negative indications, this requires further context.

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.1 (negative). This suggests a recent short-term downtrend.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

PPG Industries presents a mixed picture.

*   **The Negatives:**
    *   **Significant Underperformance:** PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The massive divergence is a red flag.
    *   **Negative Alpha:**  The consistently negative Alpha confirms underperformance compared to market expectations.
    *   **High Maximum Drawdown:** Indicative of high risk and volatility in recent years.
    *   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The projected long-term return is alarmingly low.
    *   **Overbought RSI:** Suggests a potential near-term pullback.
*   **The Positives:**
    *   **Analyst Buy Consensus:**  Analysts, on average, rate the stock a "Buy," with a potential upside based on the target price.
    *   **Solid Profit Margins:** Profit margins are generally strong, showing good operational efficiency.
    *   **"Best Managed Company" Recognition:** Indicates sound management practices.
    *   **Sustainability Initiatives:** REDCert² certification suggests progress in sustainability.
*   **The Uncertainties:**
    *   **Inconsistent Revenue and ROE:** Volatility in revenue and ROE needs deeper analysis. The Q4 2024 results stand out.
    *   **Contradictory Signals:** The positive analyst sentiment and short-term price trend contrast with the long-term underperformance and negative indicators.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, it is difficult to recommend investment in PPG at this time. The long-term underperformance, negative expected return, and high risk outweigh the positive analyst sentiment and recent news.

*   **Understand the rationale behind the analyst "Buy" ratings.** What are they seeing that justifies a positive outlook?
*   **Analyze the sector comparison.** How does PPG's performance compare to its peers in the materials industry?
