**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG Industries Inc. exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound, the substantially negative long-term expected return (-1738.4%), coupled with the lack of detailed financial data and recent downward trend, raises serious concerns.  The volatility in alpha and beta further highlights the risks associated with this stock.  Further investigation into the reasons for the significant underperformance, as well as acquisition of missing financial data, are crucial before any investment decision is made.  The projected extremely negative long-term return strongly suggests caution.
