**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha indicates significant underperformance relative to the market. The recent years show particularly poor alpha values.
*   **Beta:** Negative beta suggests an inverse correlation with the market. This could be beneficial during market downturns, but it has likely contributed to underperformance during the S&P 500's bull run.
*   **CAGR:** Negative CAGR in recent periods confirms the stock's poor performance.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant volatility and potential for large losses.

*   **20-day Moving Average:** 97.13
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 102.68

**Analysis:**  The current price has recently jumped above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages.  It's still below the 60-day moving average.  The significant change from the previous close suggests a recent positive catalyst (likely related to news, see section 4).

*   **Expected Return (%):** -2181.8 (Very negative, long-term underperformance expectation)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI is rising, indicating increasing buying pressure but is not yet at an overbought level.
*   The recent positive change in relative divergence supports the recent price increase.
*   The extremely negative expected return is a major concern.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Sustainability Rating:** PPG earned top sustainability ratings, highlighting its commitment to environmental responsibility.
*   **PFAS-Free Filtration Launch:**  This signals a potential new focus on sustainability and could drive growth in specific markets.

*   **Recycling Program:** Positive PR and potentially beneficial for brand image.
*   **Fiberglass Pipes Market:**  Indicates potential growth opportunities in related industries.

**7. Overall Summary:**

PPG Industries has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and its alpha and beta suggest a long-term trend of underperformance and negative correlation with the market. Recent positive news regarding sustainability and a potential new growth area (PFAS-free filtration) might be contributing to a recent price increase, reflected in the positive change from the previous close and the rising RSI. However, the extremely negative expected return is a major cause for concern. Analyst ratings are positive, but it's important to consider the lack of recent changes and the potential impact of the AkzoNobel/Axalta merger. The financial data shows fluctuating revenue and ROE, with a concerning negative ROE in Q4 2024. The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals (positive analyst ratings and recent price action vs. poor historical performance and negative expected return), a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards, considering the company's long-term underperformance, its sensitivity to market trends (as indicated by the negative beta), and the potential impact of increased competition. Deeper due diligence into the specific drivers of the negative expected return and the long-term sustainability of the recent positive news is highly recommended.
