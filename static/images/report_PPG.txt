| 2023-2025  | -25.0% | 80.6% | -84.0% | -1.0  | 22.3   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates, indicating inconsistent growth over different periods. The recent periods (2018-2025) show negative CAGR values.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD indicates significant potential for losses from peak to trough during the examined periods. The MDD figures are very high.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha suggests PPG has underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) after accounting for risk. The negative Alpha values are substantial, becoming increasingly negative in recent periods.
*   **Beta:** Negative Beta values suggest an inverse correlation with the market. This is unusual and could indicate the stock tends to move in the opposite direction of the S&P 500, or could be a spurious result of the time period examined. The negative correlation has also become more pronounced.
*   **Cap(B):** The company's market capitalization (in Billions) has fluctuated over the years, but is trending slightly downwards from 2019-2025.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 98.70
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   **Price:** 98.70
    *   **Previous Close:** 95.20
    *   **Change:** 3.68
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   **5-day SMA:** 95.68
    *   **20-day SMA:** 97.13
    *   **60-day SMA:** 102.68

**Analysis:** The stock price closed higher than its previous close and is showing a slight rebound. However, the 5-day and 20-day SMAs are below the 60-day SMA, which might suggest a potential downward trend in the medium term, although the recent price increase could indicate a short-term shift.

**3) Market Risk Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 63.24
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.29
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (1 share - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 3.2 (+) 단기상승 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1046.7

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, indicating a moderate level of risk.
*   The RSI of 63.24 indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold but is trending towards overbought territory.
*   The PPO of 0.29 suggests a slight positive momentum.
*   The hybrid signal recommends buying, possibly due to the stock being oversold previously.
*   The recent increase in relative divergence indicates short-term upward momentum.
*   The *extremely* negative expected return of -1046.7% is highly concerning and suggests very poor long-term prospects based on the model. This is a HUGE red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Valuation Assessment:** An article on Simply Wall St. discusses assessing PPG's valuation after recent share price declines. This suggests concerns about the stock's current value.
*   **Institutional Selling:** MarketBeat reports that Franklin Resources Inc. sold shares of PPG Industries, indicating decreased confidence from a major institutional investor.
*   **Underperformance:** Yahoo Finance highlights PPG's underperformance relative to the Basic Materials sector, further reinforcing the underperformance concerns.
*   **Sustainability Rating:** Business Wire reports PPG earning a top "AAA" sustainability rating from MSCI, which is a positive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) indicator.
*   **Earnings Beat:** Reuters reports that PPG beat third-quarter profit estimates on higher sales, which is a positive sign.
*   **"Don't Buy" Recommendation:** Trefis explains why you shouldn't be buying PPG Industries stock, which is a highly negative sentiment.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. Positive aspects include the sustainability rating and a recent earnings beat. However, the negative news outweighs the positive, including valuation concerns, institutional selling, sector underperformance, and a "don't buy" recommendation.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.17 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 119.80 / High: 131.00 / Low: 109.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No specific changes listed.

**Analysis:** Despite the negative news and poor performance, analyst consensus remains at "Buy." This could be based on potential future recovery or different valuation models. The target price suggests upside potential, but it's crucial to weigh this against the other negative indicators. Without recent changes, the data is a bit vague.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

PPG Industries Inc. is currently facing significant challenges. While recent earnings and a sustainability rating provide some positive signs, the overall picture is concerning:

*   **Underperformance:** PPG has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, with a massive negative divergence. The negative Alpha further supports the relative underperformance, which means PPG's returns haven't been commensurate to the risk taken.
*   **Risk:** The high MDD values indicate significant potential for losses.
*   **Negative News:** The negative news headlines regarding valuation concerns, institutional selling, sector underperformance, and a "don't buy" recommendation weigh heavily.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** Analyst consensus remains at "Buy," which contradicts the negative news and underperformance. This might be due to future growth expectations not reflected in the current data or differences in valuation approaches.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The -1046.7% expected return is a HUGE red flag, signaling potential severe long-term problems based on the model's assessment. This should warrant deep investigation.
*   **Mixed Financials:** Revenue, profit margins, equity, and ROE show fluctuation, indicating some instability. The recent ROE is positive and in line with previous quarters, but the large negative dip in Q4 2024 is concerning.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Based on this data, investing in PPG Industries Inc. would be considered **HIGHLY RISKY** despite analyst consensus. The significant underperformance, negative news sentiment, large drawdown risk, and particularly the extremely negative expected return strongly suggest caution. A deeper investigation is needed to understand the model's negative outlook and whether the potential upside justifies the risks.
