**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the provided period. While financial statements show consistent profitability and relatively stable equity, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend. The extremely negative expected return needs further investigation and clarification of the calculation methodology.  Further research is needed to determine the cause of the significant underperformance relative to the market and to validate the provided expected return figure before making any investment decisions. The provided data is somewhat contradictory and requires additional context to draw robust conclusions.  Addressing the data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry, exceptionally low expected return) is crucial for a more accurate analysis.
