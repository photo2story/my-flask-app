## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

The cumulative return of PPG (17.54%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 120.73%.  The divergence is -103.2%, placing it at the 2.4th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided Alpha values consistently remain around 0.1, suggesting marginal outperformance relative to the market benchmark after adjusting for systematic risk (Beta). However, the significantly lower CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) compared to S&P 500 over various periods demonstrates this small alpha is not enough to offset the market's significantly higher gains.  The high Beta values across the years indicate that PPG's stock price is highly sensitive to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $126.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $126.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $124.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $126.26

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, and significantly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some recent upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 60.94  - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.377 - A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.4 - Indicates short-term upward price movement.

The provided expected return of 0.0% for long-term (2+ years) investment relative to the S&P 500 suggests that, based on the current analysis, the investor should not expect to outperform the S&P 500 significantly.  Given the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 observed in the past,  caution is advised.  The slight recent upward momentum does not compensate for the historical underperformance.  There is no indication of a sudden price surge or drop based on the provided data, despite the slight difference between the closing price ($126.86) and the last market price ($126.90).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's no consistent upward trend in revenue; Q2 2024 had the highest revenue at $4.79B, followed by a slight decrease in the subsequent quarter. EPS also fluctuates;  it reached its peak in Q2 2024 at $2.25, before dropping to $2.01 in Q3 2024.  A direct comparison to analyst expectations is impossible due to the lack of that data. The provided data only allows for an analysis of actual reported numbers.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue shows some volatility but overall remains relatively stable around $4.5B-$4.8B.  Profit margins are consistently high (40-43%), indicating good profitability.  Equity fluctuates slightly, and ROE (Return on Equity) is inconsistent, suggesting variability in the company's ability to generate returns from its shareholders' equity.  In general, the profitability indicators are positive, but the volatility and inconsistency suggest a need for further investigation into the underlying drivers of this variation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook data was provided to analyze.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, despite generally positive profitability metrics.  While recent price action shows some upward momentum, this needs to be viewed within the context of the company's historical underperformance against the broader market.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook, but the long-term outlook needs further analysis, considering the lack of analyst expectations and market context.  The inconsistent ROE and revenue trends also warrant closer examination.  Further research is needed before making any investment decisions.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits the scope of this analysis.
