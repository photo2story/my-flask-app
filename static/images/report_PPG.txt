**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PPG's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.  While the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 56.22%, PPG shows a negative cumulative return of -32.02%. This results in a substantial divergence of -88.2%, placing it at the 8.8th percentile of its historical range (max: 7.1%, min: -97.4%).  This indicates PPG's underperformance relative to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values over the years.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), the recent years (2020-2025) demonstrate negative alpha, indicating underperformance against the market benchmark. The beta, representing market sensitivity, also varies but generally hovers around 0.2 indicating lower volatility than the market. The consistent high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant downside risk.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue has generally remained stable around $4.5B-$4.8B, EPS shows some fluctuations.  There appears to be a duplicated entry for 2024-10-17.  More detailed analysis requires a clearer picture of the data and a comparison to previous years' performance.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|

| 2024-10-17 | 1.8  | 4.64 B$    |


**5) Financial Information:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.17B | 34.87% |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PPG is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly. Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, though the RSI indicates potential oversold conditions.  Earnings show some volatility, and financial data reveal concerns about profitability and return on equity.  The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative expected return, the recent price drop, and the fluctuating financial performance is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high MDD throughout the years highlights the significant risk associated with this stock.  At this time, a long-term investment in PPG, given the provided data, seems risky compared to the S&P 500.
