**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

PPG Industries has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. The Alpha, Beta analysis further confirms this trend, with negative Alpha values, the stock generates less return for the risk taken compared to the market. A negative beta indicates an inverse relationship. Recent price action shows short-term positive momentum, but the long-term trend is less clear. Technical indicators like the RSI suggest it is moving into the overbought zone. The analyst consensus is positive with a "Buy" rating, which is directly opposed to the algorithm/calculated "Expected Return" which forecasts that the stock's performance will significantly decline over a 2 year period.

Recent news highlights both challenges (CFO retirement) and potential opportunities (institutional investment, valuation discussions).  Earnings have been relatively stable. Although there are some positives (analyst ratings, institutional investment), the extremely negative expected return, the large drawdown, the negative alpha and negative beta values suggest caution. Given the data, a wait-and-see approach might be prudent, monitoring future earnings reports and strategic initiatives. It appears there is an issue with the calculated/algorithm value for "Expected Return".
