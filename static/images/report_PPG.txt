**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG currently exhibits a bearish outlook.  The significant underperformance against the S&P 500, negative expected return, negative PPO, and concerning negative ROE in the last quarter raise serious concerns. While some indicators (RSI nearing oversold levels) might suggest potential short-term buying opportunities, the overall picture is negative.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the negative ROE and the significant drop in revenue in the last quarter is crucial before considering any investment.  The highly volatile nature of the stock (as seen in the beta values), makes it a high-risk investment.  Further analysis of the company's fundamentals and future outlook is needed before making an investment decision.  The extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 strongly cautions against a long-term investment strategy.
