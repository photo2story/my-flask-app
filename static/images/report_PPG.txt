| 2023-2025  | -22.0%  | 80.6%  | -89.0%  | -1.0   | 23.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates and is negative in many periods, indicating inconsistent performance.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is very high in recent years (around 80%), suggesting substantial risk and price volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Negative Alpha consistently indicates underperformance relative to the market risk-adjusted return. PPG has not been generating excess returns.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally negative, especially in recent years.  A negative beta means the stock tends to move in the *opposite* direction of the market, but this must be carefully considered.  In this case, it's likely a statistical artifact of underperformance, rather than a truly negatively correlated asset.
*   **Cap(B):** The Market Cap (in Billions) fluctuates, but there is no significant correlation with the recent data.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 104.32
*   **Previous Close:** 103.55
*   **Change:** 0.74
*   **5-day SMA:** 103.32
*   **20-day SMA:** 102.09
*   **60-day SMA:** 100.19

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, further supporting this bullish signal. The recent price change indicates a slight upward movement.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 66.40 (Approaching Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.13
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1736.9%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A high MRI score suggests favorable market conditions *in general*. However, this indicator needs to be interpreted cautiously alongside the company-specific information.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 66.40 is approaching the overbought level (typically 70), which might indicate that the stock could be due for a pullback.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.13 is close to zero and doesn't give a clear indication of either a bullish or bearish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying 100% with the available cash, which contrasts with the negative expected return.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence suggests a short-term decline compared to its divergence with the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The highly negative expected return (-1736.9%) is a major red flag, indicating analysts believe the stock will likely significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.

**Key Concerns:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** PPG has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Negative Alpha and High Drawdown:** Consistently negative alpha and very high maximum drawdowns highlight poor risk-adjusted returns and significant volatility.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return strongly suggests that the stock is not expected to perform well relative to the market.
*   **Mixed News:** Recent news articles highlight current struggles, although some suggest potential for improvement in the future.

*   **Potential Turnaround:** The news article suggesting potential for improvement in 2026 might be a reason for the analyst optimism. Investigate the basis for this potential turnaround.
*   **Industry-Specific Factors:** Consider if there are specific industry-related headwinds affecting PPG.
