**7. Overall Analysis (Summary of points 1-6):**

PPG has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period. While some technical indicators hint at potential short-term recovery, the overall trend appears bearish. Financial performance exhibits some volatility, requiring deeper examination of the underlying factors affecting revenue and profitability.  News and analyst sentiment (which need to be researched independently) will play a crucial role in forming a comprehensive investment opinion. The expected return of 0% warrants caution, suggesting a need for a thorough risk assessment before any investment.

**8. Recommendation:**

Based on the available data, PPG's performance warrants close monitoring.  While the oversold RSI and short-term upward momentum provide a potential buying opportunity for short-term traders, the long-term outlook requires a more comprehensive analysis, particularly concerning the consistent underperformance against the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the most recent earnings, analyst opinions, and news is critical before making an investment decision.   The 0.0% expected return based on the current data, however, suggests that long-term investors should proceed with caution and seriously consider the risk involved.  Consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
