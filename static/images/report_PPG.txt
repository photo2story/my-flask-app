The Alpha values fluctuate considerably, suggesting inconsistent outperformance compared to the market benchmark.  Beta is generally low, indicating relatively low market sensitivity, except for some periods with unusually high betas.  This volatility warrants further analysis.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of $115.38 is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The significant price drop of -$6.00 from the previous close indicates a considerable negative market reaction.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (54.75):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to neutral territory.
* **PPO (0.095):** A slightly positive PPO indicates a potential bullish signal, though it's weak.
* **Relative Strength Change (-2.2):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-4452.0%):** This extremely negative expected return is concerning and requires further investigation.  The data suggests significant underperformance against the S&P 500, even in a long-term scenario, which is a major red flag.

The significant negative price change of -$6.00 clearly reflects a recent negative market event influencing PPG's stock price.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance is significantly lagging the S&P 500, indicated by a substantial negative cumulative return difference. While profit margins and revenue appear relatively stable, the inconsistent earnings, fluctuating ROE, and extremely negative projected return raise significant concerns.  The recent sharp price drop suggests a negative market reaction, possibly due to unforeseen circumstances or disappointing financial news not included in this report.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the underperformance, the extremely negative projected return, and the potential issues highlighted in the financial data.  The data provided raises serious questions about the long-term viability of PPG as an investment relative to the broader market.  Additional fundamental and technical analysis are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
