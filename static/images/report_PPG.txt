The cumulative return for PPG over the analyzed period is 13.32%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a 119.94% return.  The difference is -106.6%, placing it at the 3.8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500's performance (based on the provided -111.1% to 6.2% range).  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While revenue generally remains stable around $4.5-4.8B, EPS fluctuates.  There's a discrepancy in the data with two entries for 2024-10-17.  Further clarification or correction is required.  The data needs more comprehensive analysis to draw firm conclusions about the company's financial health.  A trend analysis, year-over-year comparison, and inclusion of any reported guidance are needed to determine if this volatility is normal or indicates a potential issue.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's significant underperformance against the S&P 500 is the most striking observation. While the company demonstrates reasonably stable revenue and high profit margins, the inconsistent EPS and ROE figures, coupled with the negative and exceptionally large projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 (-1103.8%), raise serious concerns. The technical indicators present a mixed signal, with the RSI suggesting potential overbought conditions and the PPO showing positive momentum but not overwhelmingly so.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough review of the data discrepancies (specifically regarding earnings data and the drastically negative expected return), a deeper analysis of the financial statements and industry trends, and consultation with a financial advisor is strongly recommended. The current data alone does not support a positive investment outlook.
