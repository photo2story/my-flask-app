2024-11-20 - Analysis Report
## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  Over the analyzed period, PPG's cumulative return (15.49%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's return (124.78%). The difference is -109.29%, placing it at the 4.15th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varied considerably year-to-year, often exceeding the market (indicated by a Beta > 1), the recent period (2022-2024) shows significant underperformance (-23.3% CAGR).  Alpha, consistently above 0.9, suggests some outperformance relative to the market in several periods, however this is not consistent and overshadowed by the recent decline.  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) are consistently high, indicating substantial risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $123.42 (Last Market: $121.22)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $122.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $124.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $126.65

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent increase from $121.22 to $123.42 shows a slight upward movement, but remains within a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (40.06):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (-0.11):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (3.67+):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative performance, but this is minor compared to the overall underperformance.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) suggests cautiousness.  Given the historical underperformance, this needs further investigation to determine if the 0% is a reflection of market consensus or an oversight.  If the model used to generate this expectation doesn't consider factors like the current low RSI or potential market recovery, it could be misleading.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show some fluctuation. While revenue generally remains above $4.5B, EPS shows considerable variability.  There's a need for comparison to analyst estimates to assess performance relative to expectations.  The repeated entry of 2024-10-17 data needs clarification.  A missing estimate for the last quarter would significantly hinder a complete analysis.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, while profit margins show some fluctuation. There is a downward trend in profit margin from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, but ROE is quite volatile, indicating fluctuations in profitability.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires accessing real-time news sources.  I cannot access real-time data, including news articles from sources like Shacknews or Finbold. To complete this section, please provide relevant news articles published within the last two days.)*  The analysis here would include sentiment analysis of the news, discussion of any earnings surprises, and analyst opinions on the future prospects of PPG.  It would integrate the information from sources like FINBOLD and other financial news outlets.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

PPG is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly. While it has shown periods of outperformance in the past and has a relatively stable revenue stream, recent performance (particularly 2022-2024) is worrying.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition, which could present a buying opportunity for some investors, but the significant underperformance relative to the market and the high maximum drawdowns should be a major concern. Further analysis of the latest earnings reports, comparing actual results to analyst estimates, and a thorough review of recent news are crucial before making any investment decisions. The 0% expected return, without considering the low RSI and potential for market recovery, needs further verification.  The high variability in ROE also highlights a higher risk.

It is crucial to conduct your own thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
