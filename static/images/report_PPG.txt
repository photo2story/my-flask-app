## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Performance Review

This report analyzes the performance of PPG Industries Inc., a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PPG's cumulative return (-20.78%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 78.93%.  The difference is -99.7%, placing it at the 4.8th percentile of the historical range (-105.1% to 7.0%).  This indicates PPG's substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance across the years.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, e.g., 2017-2019), others display significantly negative alpha (underperformance, e.g., 2022-2024). The beta fluctuates, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity. The high negative alpha in recent years is a significant concern, correlating strongly with its poor performance compared to VOO.  Note that the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures are high, especially for the most recent periods, indicating substantial risk.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $101.83
* **5-day Moving Average:** $100.30
* **20-day Moving Average:** $102.64
* **60-day Moving Average:** $110.44

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price change ($0.05 increase) is negligible and doesn't indicate a significant reversal.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.84 (approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.3863 (slightly above zero, suggesting a potential bullish momentum but weak)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -0.2 (short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return:** -1050.7% This extremely negative expected return, relative to the S&P 500, is a major red flag. It strongly suggests significant underperformance is expected over the long term (2+ years).


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The quarterly earnings data shows volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally remains above $4 billion, EPS fluctuates significantly, failing to show a clear upward trend.

**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively stable, but the profit margin shows some fluctuation.  The equity fluctuates, and the Return on Equity (ROE) is low and even negative in the most recent quarter (-4.13% in Q4 2024), indicating concerns about profitability and shareholder return.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

PPG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period and shows a negative long-term expected return.  The company exhibits inconsistent performance across different years, high maximum drawdowns, and volatile earnings.  While some technical indicators hint at potential oversold conditions, the overwhelmingly negative long-term expected return, low and volatile ROE, and poor recent performance against the market strongly suggest a cautious outlook.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the significant underperformance is warranted before considering any investment.  The provided data raises substantial concerns regarding the current investment viability of PPG.  Independent verification of data is highly recommended.
