## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  Over the observed period, PPG's cumulative return (14.77%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (127.58%). The difference is a substantial -112.81%, placing it at the 1.16 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results, with Alpha generally hovering around 1.0, suggesting performance roughly in line with the market's risk (Beta), except for periods of significant outperformance (e.g., 2017-2019, 2019-2021) and notable underperformance (2022-2024).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $122.65 (Last Market: $125.32)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $122.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $123.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $126.32

The recent price action shows PPG trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The relatively small gap between the last market price and the closing price indicates limited volatility in the immediate aftermath of the market close.

**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI:** 44.34 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.07 (Negative value, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.19 (Short-term downtrend)

The RSI and PPO indicators both point towards bearish sentiment. The negative relative divergence reinforces the short-term downtrend.  The last market price ($125.32) being higher than the closing price ($122.65) might be interpreted as a minor short-term pullback rather than a significant event (like a sharp drop or surge).  The expected return of 0.0% for long-term (2+ years) investment suggests that while the company is not expected to generate outperformance compared to the S&P 500,  consistent investing might still offer some diversification benefits.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue. While there's some variability quarter-to-quarter, there isn't a clear downward or upward trend.  The most recent earnings per share (EPS) of $2.01 (October 17, 2024) would need to be compared to analyst expectations to determine whether it was a positive or negative surprise.  More detailed analysis requires access to the complete financial statements and analyst consensus estimates.
