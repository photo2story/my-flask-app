*   **Beta:** Beta values have been decreasing and are negative in the recent periods, indicating that the stock price has become less sensitive to market movements.  A negative beta indicates that PPG tends to move in the *opposite* direction of the market, although the magnitude is small.

*   **5-day SMA:** 100.55
*   **20-day SMA:** 97.50
*   **60-day SMA:** 101.51

**Analysis of Stock Price:**

The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day SMAs but below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a possible short-term upward trend, but it is still facing resistance at the 60-day level. The recent change indicates a slight increase in the stock price.

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 63.30
*   **PPO:** 0.83
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (10 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -4.2 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3263.7

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI of 63.30 indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The PPO is positive, suggesting a slight upward trend in momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying 100% with cash, indicating a very safe investment (MRI: 0.90).
*   The negative change in relative divergence suggests a short-term downward trend.
*   **The very negative Expected Return of -3263.7% is alarming and requires further investigation**. It suggests a very poor outlook for future returns if investing from this point. This is highly unlikely to be accurate. This number likely has a calculation error.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

PPG Industries has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The consistently negative Alpha values in the Alpha, Beta analysis table suggest that PPG has not been generating excess returns compared to the market. Although analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating with a potential upside target price, recent news highlights concerns about underperformance compared to its sector, and an institutional investor has reduced its position.

Recent earnings data show fluctuations in both EPS and revenue, and the financial information reveals variability in revenue and ROE, with generally high profit margins.

While the MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk and the hybrid signal suggests it is a safe investment, the extremely negative Expected Return figure is a red flag that needs further investigation to ensure data accuracy. It contradicts other positive indicators like analyst ratings and MRI score.

**In conclusion, PPG appears to be a mixed bag. While analysts are generally positive, the stock's underperformance, negative alpha, and questionable expected return suggest caution. Further research into the company's strategy, the reasons behind its underperformance, and a validation of the extremely negative expected return figure are necessary before making any investment decisions.**
