    | 2023-2025  | -22.0%  | 80.6%  | -89.0%   | -1.0   | 23.6   |

    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is inconsistent, with negative values in recent periods.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is very high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
    *   **Alpha:** The negative alpha figures consistently show underperformance relative to the market benchmark. The recent alpha values are extremely negative.
    *   **Beta:** The beta values are generally negative, suggesting an inverse correlation with the market. When the market goes up, PPG tends to go down, and vice versa. The absolute values of beta are relatively low, suggesting that the impact of the market on PPG's returns is low.
    *   **Cap:** The market capitalization fluctuates, reflecting investor sentiment and company performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** \$104.32
*   **5-day SMA:** 103.318
*   **20-day SMA:** 102.0868
*   **60-day SMA:** 100.188

    *   The stock price is above all three moving averages, which *could* indicate an upward trend in the short term. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, reinforcing this potential short-term uptrend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Investment Indicators**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - This seems contradictory given other indicators and should be viewed with extreme caution. The MRI could be lagging or based on different data/calculations that don't reflect the negative trends.
*   **RSI:** 66.40 - This is approaching overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the price may be due for a pullback.
*   **PPO:** 0.131 - The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is slightly positive, supporting the potential short-term upward trend seen in the moving averages, but the value is very small.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash" - This recommendation seems aggressive and potentially risky given the other negative indicators.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Negative (-0.5), indicating a short-term downtrend in divergence.
*   **Expected Return:** -1736.9% - This is extremely negative and a major red flag. It suggests a very pessimistic outlook for long-term investment.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |

| 2024-09-30   | \$4.03B    | 40.95%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE   |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| 2025-09-30   | \$7.80B    | 5.81% |
| 2025-06-30   | \$7.58B    | 5.94% |

| 2024-09-30   | \$7.79B    | 6.01% |

*   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** While profit margins are generally healthy, the revenue figures are not consistently growing. The 2024-12-31 quarter shows significantly lower revenue and profit margin, which is concerning.
*   **Equity & ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) shows the company's profitability relative to equity. The negative ROE in 2024-12-31 is a significant warning sign. Equity has fluctuated.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Overall, the analysis presents a mixed, but largely negative, picture of PPG Industries:

*   **Negative Performance:** PPG has severely underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative cumulative return and consistently negative alpha values.
*   **High Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown values suggest significant risk.
*   **Concerning Financials:** Fluctuating revenue and a period of negative ROE raise concerns about the company's financial health.
*   **Contradictory Indicators:** The "High Investment Recommended" MRI score is highly suspect given the other negative indicators. The hybrid signal pushing for full investment also seems risky.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Reality:**  While analysts have a "Buy" rating and a positive target price, recent news headlines and the expected return of -1736.9% paint a much more pessimistic picture. The analyst consensus does not seem to incorporate the issues outlined in the news.
*   **Short-Term Uptrend (Potentially):**  The stock price is currently above its short-term moving averages, *potentially* indicating a short-term uptrend. However, this needs to be considered in the context of the broader negative trends.
*   **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward, based on analyst target prices, does not seem to outweigh the very significant risks.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, an investment in PPG Industries would be highly speculative and carry substantial risk. The company is underperforming, has concerning financial metrics, and faces negative news sentiment. The optimistic analyst consensus seems out of sync with the current reality. The HIGH MRI rating is dubious.
