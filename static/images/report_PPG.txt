* **Closing Price:** $110.73
* **5-day Moving Average:** $112.50
* **20-day Moving Average:** $113.11
* **60-day Moving Average:** $115.84

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price change (-$0.48) indicates a minor decrease from the previous close.

* **Expected Return:** -342.5% (This extremely negative figure requires further investigation and clarification; it is likely an error or a misinterpretation of the data.)


The combination of a relatively low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative strength change suggests a bearish short-term outlook, although the RSI is not yet definitively in oversold territory.  The extremely negative expected return warrants further scrutiny.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |

| 2024-10-17 | 2.01 | $4.58B        |

| 2024-10-17 | 1.80 | $4.64B        | *(Duplicate entry likely an error)*

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|

| 2023-12-31 | $4.35B  | 41.82%       |


Revenue shows significant variation, with Q4 2024 unusually low. Profit margins are generally high and consistent, except for the low margin in Q4 2024. The drop in revenue and profit margin in Q4 2024 needs further investigation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE    |
|---------|----------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $6.79B  | -4.13% |

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PPG's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500. While historical data shows periods of both outperformance and underperformance, the recent trend is negative.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, although not definitively oversold.  Earnings and financial data reveal volatility, with Q4 2024 showing a concerning drop in both revenue and profitability, and a negative ROE.  The extremely negative projected return (-342.5%) is likely an error.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the Q4 2024 performance and the validity of the expected return figure before making any investment decisions.  A thorough review of the company's guidance, industry trends, and any significant news impacting the company is strongly recommended.
