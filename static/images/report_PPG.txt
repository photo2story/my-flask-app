*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values, suggesting significant volatility and risk.  MDD consistently increases, meaning the risk grows.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha indicates PPG has underperformed relative to its expected return based on its risk (Beta). Negative and decreasing alpha: Getting worse and worse.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are low, approaching negative values, suggesting low correlation with the market. This means PPG is less sensitive to overall market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 102.68
*   **Last-market:** price': 102.68, 'previousClose': 102.91, 'change': -0.22
*   **5-day SMA:** 103.346
*   **20-day SMA:** 101.1588
*   **60-day SMA:** 100.2433

**Analysis:** The stock price closed slightly down today. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which suggests a possible short-term upward trend. The 20-day SMA is also above the 60-day SMA, further suggesting an upward short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 62.61 (Slightly overbought, but not extreme)
*   **PPO:** 0.2771
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (10 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1341.6

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI indicates the stock is nearing overbought conditions.
*   The positive change in relative divergence over the past 20 days suggests a short-term upward trend, aligning with the moving average analysis.
*   However, the **extremely negative Expected Return (-1341.6%)** is a major red flag. This suggests that based on the model used, long-term investment in PPG from this point is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.  This needs further investigation to understand the model's assumptions and drivers.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Analyst Price Targets:** Citigroup analyst expects the stock price to rise.  A new analyst forecast gives a price target of $120.
*   **Sustainability Initiatives:** PPG achieved REDCert² sustainable raw material certification at two key European sites.
*   **Stock Performance Comparison:** A report compares PPG's stock performance to other materials stocks.
*   **Stock Prediction:** An article discusses where analysts see the stock going by 2027.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed.  Analyst price targets are generally positive, suggesting potential upside.  The sustainability certification is a positive development for ESG-conscious investors. However, the overall stock performance comparison and long-term prediction articles should be carefully examined for underlying concerns.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.17)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: $119.00 / High: $130.00 / Low: $109.00

**Analysis:**  Despite the negative performance, the analyst consensus is "Buy" with an average price target significantly above the current price. This discrepancy warrants further scrutiny. Are analysts factoring in potential turnaround strategies, industry recovery, or other catalysts not reflected in the historical data?

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

PPG Industries has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. Its Alpha has consistently been negative and is getting worse, the beta values are getting near negative values, and has experienced large MDD values. While recent short-term indicators suggest a potential upward trend, the extremely negative long-term expected return is concerning. Analyst consensus is "Buy" with a positive price target, creating a divergence between the data-driven analysis and analyst sentiment. The company is focusing on sustainability, which is a positive long-term trend. Recent earnings and financial data show fluctuating revenue, consistent profit margins, and positive ROE (except for one quarter).

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this data, a high level of caution is warranted.

*   **Further Investigation is needed:** Investigate the assumptions behind the extremely negative expected return. Understand why analysts have a "Buy" rating despite the negative trends.
*   **Monitor Performance:** Closely monitor the stock's performance and any company-specific news or announcements.
*   **Consider Risk Tolerance:**  Given the volatility and underperformance, PPG may not be suitable for risk-averse investors.
