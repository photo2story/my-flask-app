MDD increased, indicating greater risk. CAGR's are declining, especially the later values.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 104.25
*   **Previous Close:** 104.32
*   **Change:** -0.07
*   **5-day SMA:** 103.32
*   **20-day SMA:** 102.09
*   **60-day SMA:** 100.19

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the previous close, indicating a minimal recent drop.  The moving averages show an upward trend over the short (5-day) to longer-term (60-day), suggesting a slight recent upward price momentum.  The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, confirming the trend.

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 66.40 (Approaching Overbought)

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1736.9%

**Analysis:** The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests that now is a good time to invest, but the RSI is approaching overbought levels, which could indicate a potential pullback. The negative expected return is very concerning, implying significant potential losses relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. The "Hybrid Signal" of 'buy' and the high MRI seem contradictory to the very negative expected return.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

PPG Industries has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  Recent stock price movement shows a slight upward trend, but the very negative expected return is alarming. The RSI suggests the stock may be approaching overbought conditions. Analyst consensus is "Buy," with a target price above the current price, suggesting potential undervaluation. The mixed news headlines reflect concerns about recent performance but also point to potential improvement in the future. The financial data shows generally strong profit margins and ROE, although with some recent fluctuations.

**Overall Conclusion:** The data presents a mixed picture. While analysts are optimistic and the MRI suggests a good time to invest, the significantly negative expected return, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and mixed news should give investors pause. Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of the negative expected return and whether the potential for improvement in 2026 is realistic.
