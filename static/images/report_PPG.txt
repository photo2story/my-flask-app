The substantial underperformance warrants further investigation into the underlying causes of PPGâ€™s poor relative performance.  Before any investment decision, more comprehensive data analysis, including detailed financial statements and market outlook, is essential. The high volatility and negative alpha suggest a higher risk profile.
