**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

PPG Industries Inc. has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While recent financial data shows stable revenues and healthy profit margins, the stock's negative alpha, high maximum drawdowns, and low expected return are concerning. Analyst consensus is a "Buy" with a price target suggesting potential upside. The mixed news headlines and technical indicators create uncertainty. Recent price is hovering around $102, while the target price is $119, so analysts may be thinking it's a good time to buy. Considering the underperformance and negative outlook for outperformance, investors should proceed with caution and carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards. A deeper dive into why they are underperforming S&P is needed to fully understand their potential.
