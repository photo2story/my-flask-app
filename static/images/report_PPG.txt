**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500. While some technical indicators suggest potential positive momentum, the extremely negative projected long-term return is a major concern and requires clarification.  The company's financial data reveals some volatility in revenue, EPS, and ROE, but no clear downward trend.  A more in-depth analysis considering industry comparisons, macroeconomic factors, and the questionable -1942.8% expected return is critical before forming a conclusive opinion.  The duplicate data entry also necessitates data validation.  Considering the significantly negative expected return provided, a recommendation cannot be made until further investigation into this figure's derivation has occurred.  The provided financial data doesn't immediately suggest severe problems, but consistent underperformance relative to the market is worrying.
