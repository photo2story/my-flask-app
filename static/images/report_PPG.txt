## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  The provided data shows significantly underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with negative cumulative returns and concerning technical indicators.  Earnings data shows some volatility but requires further analysis for a complete picture.  Crucially, a lack of key financial data (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) hinders a thorough assessment.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **PPG Cumulative Return:** 0.0%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** -82.57%
* **Relative Divergence:** -82.6 (20.1% percentile based on historical min/max range).

PPG has severely underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  Its relative divergence suggests that its underperformance is extreme compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The consistently near-zero CAGR and high negative Maximum Drawdowns (MDDs) across all periods are significant concerns.  While the beta of approximately 1.0 suggests similar market volatility, the lack of positive alpha indicates a failure to outperform the benchmark.  The market capitalization fluctuates, indicating market sentiment changes toward the company.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-04-30 | 1.63  | 3.68 B$     |

| 2025-04-30 | 1.70  | 3.85 B$     |

Earnings show some volatility, with a decline in EPS and revenue in the most recent quarter (2025-04-30) compared to the prior quarters, though the data contains a duplicate entry.  More data is required to identify trends.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data severely limits the ability to conduct a proper financial analysis. Key profitability and growth metrics cannot be assessed.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, showing consistently negative returns and high maximum drawdowns. Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, while earnings data shows some volatility but requires more context. The critical lack of key financial data prevents a comprehensive assessment.  The extremely negative expected return should be treated with skepticism, given the methodological uncertainties and reliance on past underperformance.  Further investigation into the company's fundamentals, competitive landscape, and any specific catalysts affecting performance is crucial before making any investment decisions.
