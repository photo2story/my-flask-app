**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, showing considerable volatility both in terms of return and market sensitivity (Beta).  While some short-term indicators suggest a mildly positive outlook, the extremely negative long-term expected return (-317.4%) and the fluctuating financial performance raise significant concerns. The drastic drop in revenue and negative ROE in the last quarter need further investigation.  Before considering any investment, thorough due diligence is crucial, including an understanding of the factors contributing to the substantially negative long-term expected return.  The high degree of volatility suggests PPG is a higher risk investment.
