## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

The cumulative return of PPG is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The difference is -107.4%, indicating a substantial underperformance.  The relative divergence of -107.4% places it near the lower bound of the historical range (-109.3% to 6.2%), suggesting considerable underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting marginal outperformance relative to the market, but this is overshadowed by the dramatically lower overall return.  The beta values consistently range from 0.1 to 1, suggesting low sensitivity to market movements.  CAGR and MDD vary significantly year-over-year, highlighting volatility in performance.  The substantial negative CAGR in the most recent two periods (-35% and -15%) is a key concern.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $115.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $119.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $122.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $124.54

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (25.43):**  Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity, although this should be considered in conjunction with other factors.
* **PPO (-0.41):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent increase of 1.5 suggests short-term upward movement, counteracting the longer-term trend indicated by the moving averages.
* **Expected Return (-2655.5%):** This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and needs further investigation to determine the source and reliability of this figure.  A -2655.5% projected return is unrealistic, suggesting a potential error in the calculation or data used.
* **Current Price and Volatility:** The current price of $115.42 is below the moving averages suggesting a potential trend reversal in the short term.  However, without additional information on the speed of the price movements it is difficult to classify this is either a significant upward or downward trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly results show some variability:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates between $4.31B and $4.79B, without a clear consistent upward or downward trend.  A decline is observed between Q2 and Q3 2024.
* **EPS:** Shows some volatility, ranging from $1.70 to $2.25, again without a clear and consistent trend.  There is a notable decline between Q2 and Q3 2024.
* **Significant changes:** There's no clear pattern of consistent growth in either revenue or EPS.  In fact, the most recent quarter shows declines compared to the previous one.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates, and profit margins are relatively stable, ranging from 40.74% to 43.28%.  However, there is a slight declining trend visible in the profit margin.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable, while ROE varies considerably.   The ROE shows substantial volatility.  The low ROE in Q4 2023 is particularly notable.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PPG is currently exhibiting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The recent earnings show some volatility, without a clear upward trend. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but this must be evaluated cautiously in light of the negative price trends and low expected return, which appears to be erroneously calculated.  A thorough review of current market conditions, analyst opinions, and a reassessment of the significantly negative expected return calculation are crucial for informed decision-making.  The substantial declines in recent quarters necessitate a careful evaluation of the company's strategy and future outlook.  Additional information regarding recent news and analyst opinions is needed to draw comprehensive conclusions.
