**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:**  Consistently negative Alpha values indicate that PPG has underperformed relative to what its Beta would predict based on market movements. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a severely negative Alpha of -88.0%, highlighting significant underperformance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values, mostly negative, suggest an inverse or low correlation with the S&P 500. A negative beta means the stock tends to move in the *opposite* direction of the market. If the market goes up, it tends to go down, and vice-versa. Although PPG has a small Beta, the performance is still weak, indicating that other company-specific factors have more impact on PPG performance, and PPG is independent of the S&P 500 Index as a whole.
*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating CAGR values illustrate the volatility in PPG's returns over different periods.
*   **MDD:** High MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values indicate substantial risk and potential for significant losses during the specified periods.

*   **20-day SMA:** $101.1588

**Analysis:** The recent price ($102.68) is slightly below the 5-day SMA ($103.35) but above the 20-day ($101.16) and 60-day ($100.24) SMAs. This suggests that while there might be some short-term downward pressure, the stock is still trending upward over a longer time horizon. The small negative change from the previous close (-$0.22) indicates minimal fluctuation in the last trading session.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

PPG Industries has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, as indicated by the negative cumulative return and divergence. The Alpha/Beta analysis confirms this underperformance, with consistently negative Alpha values.

Technically, the stock price is showing signs of short-term downward pressure but remains in a slightly longer-term uptrend based on the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. The RSI indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.

The analyst consensus is "Buy," with an average target price suggesting potential upside. Recent news includes positive analyst ratings and operational achievements related to sustainability.

However, the *highly negative* Expected Return is a major cause for concern. It indicates a model prediction of significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if an investment is held long-term from this point.  This contradicts the analyst "Buy" consensus.

The financial data shows fluctuating revenue, healthy profit margins (except for one quarter), and relatively stable equity.

**Overall Recommendation:**

While analyst ratings and some technical indicators suggest potential upside, the significantly negative Expected Return raises serious questions about the stock's future performance. The large negative difference and alpha indicates that company-specific challenges have more impact on PPG's performance, and PPG is independent of the S&P 500 Index as a whole. Therefore, **investors should exercise caution and conduct further due diligence before investing in PPG.** Consider investigating the reasons behind the model's negative Expected Return prediction. Look at company-specific risk factors. Consider understanding why PPG doesn't follow S&P500 with Beta and also see if you can understand more about the company performance.
