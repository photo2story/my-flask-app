    *   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  PPG's Alpha is consistently negative across all periods, indicating underperformance relative to its expected return based on its Beta.  The Beta hovers around 1, suggesting that PPG's volatility is similar to the market.  The negative CAGR and high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values in recent periods (2018-2020, 2020-2022, 2022-2024, 2023-2025) indicate significant losses and volatility.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 104.35
*   **Previous Close:** 102.46
*   **Change:** 1.84
*   **5-day SMA:** 103.81
*   **20-day SMA:** 102.68
*   **60-day SMA:** 100.24

    *   **Analysis:** The stock price closed higher than the previous day and all SMAs. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA. This indicates a recent upward trend. The 1.84 price change can be considered a notable increase.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 59.00
*   **PPO:** -0.02
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (10 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** 2.4 (+) - Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1210.0

    *   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI of 59 indicates a slightly overbought condition, leaning bullish but not excessively so. The PPO is slightly negative, indicating that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying with 100% of available cash, which, despite a low MRI, indicates high confidence in the stock. The short-term increase in divergence suggests recent positive momentum. However, the extremely negative expected return suggests very poor future performance compared to the S&P 500, based on the calculations.

ROE fluctuates, with the negative value in Q4 2024 being a significant concern. The increasing equity shows the company's asset base is growing.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

PPG Industries is a company that has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent times, as evidenced by its negative cumulative return and high divergence. While recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, underlying financials and news sentiment present a mixed picture.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Underperformance:** The most significant concern is the stark underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The negative Alpha figures reinforce this.
*   **Financial Health:** Revenue and profit margins appear reasonably healthy, but ROE volatility, including a negative value, warrants closer examination.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Analyst ratings are generally positive ("Buy"), and target prices suggest potential upside. However, news articles present a more cautious outlook, with some questioning the stock's fundamentals and advising against buying.
*   **Market Risk:** The MRI indicates a medium level of investment risk, while the hybrid signal surprisingly recommends buying. This difference requires more analysis.
*   **Expected Return:** Extremely negative expected returns are a warning sign.

**Overall Conclusion:**

PPG Industries is a complex case. While there are some positive signs, such as analyst optimism and recent price momentum, the significant underperformance, mixed news sentiment, and low expected returns suggest caution. Potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence, investigate the reasons for the negative divergence and low ROE, and carefully consider the risks before investing. They should also investigate the discrepancy between the medium market risk and the buy hybrid signal.
