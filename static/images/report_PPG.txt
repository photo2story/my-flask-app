**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:**  The consistently negative Alpha values, particularly in recent periods, suggest that PPG has underperformed relative to its expected return based on its risk (Beta). This underperformance is quite pronounced in the later years.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates and is sometimes negative, indicating the stock's price is not strongly correlated with the market. A negative Beta indicates PPG may move in the opposite direction of the market. A Beta of 2.0 in 2023-2025 is an outlier.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values across all periods indicate substantial risk and volatility associated with PPG's returns.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 110.08
*   **Previous Close:** 111.21
*   **Change:** -1.02
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 112.12
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 109.94
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 107.70

**Analysis:** PPG closed lower than its previous close, indicating a slight downward move. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend. However, the price is below the 5-day MA, which could signal a weakening of this short-term trend.

### 3. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.36 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 51.31 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.05 (Slightly Bearish)
*   **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** 1.7 (Positive, indicating recent short-term increase in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2974.7 (Significantly Negative)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests low market risk.
*   The RSI around 50 indicates a neutral momentum.
*   The negative PPO hints at a slightly bearish trend.
*   The positive change in relative divergence over 20 days suggests that PPG might be starting to catch up to its benchmark, though this could also be a short-term fluctuation.
*   The dramatically negative expected return is an extreme outlier and warrants further investigation. Such a large negative number is highly unusual and may be due to data errors or model limitations.

**Issue Consideration:** The price change of -1.02 reflects a slight downward pressure, but it is not significant enough to warrant a "급반등" (sudden rally) or "급하락" (sudden drop) designation.

Alpha values are consistently negative, indicating underperformance relative to risk. The technical indicators provide a mixed signal, with a low MRI and a neutral RSI. However, the PPO is slightly bearish.

Recent news suggests that PPG is experiencing volatility, which could be influenced by market events or company-specific actions. Recent earnings show fluctuating EPS and declining revenue, indicating potential issues in the company's performance. The latest ROE has decreased while the equity is also decreasing.

**Recommendation:**

Given the negative divergence from the S&P 500, negative Alpha, recent revenue declines, and current volatility, a *cautious* approach is warranted. The dramatically negative expected return number needs to be confirmed by further analysis, as it is an extreme outlier and could skew overall conclusions. Investors should monitor the company's news and earnings closely.
