        <h1>Stock Strategy Backtesting and Analysis</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on comparing the performance of individual stocks with benchmark indices such as the S&P 500 (tracked via the VOO ETF). It provides tools to visualize and analyze cumulative returns, divergence metrics, and other key financial indicators, enabling users to assess the relative strength of specific stocks over time.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The backtesting engine simulates a monthly investment strategy, where a fixed amount is consistently invested. The engine generates cumulative return comparisons between target stocks and the S&P 500 index (VOO). Additionally, it offers analysis tools to help you understand historical performance, recent trends, and expected future performance.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cumulative Total Return:</strong> Tracks the stock's total return compared to VOO.</li>
            <li><strong>Divergence:</strong> Measures the performance gap between the stock and the S&P 500 over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Relative Divergence:</strong> Highlights the stock's position within its historical divergence range.</li>
            <li><strong>Expected Return:</strong> Projects the likely future performance over a 5 to 10-year period.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Monthly Investment Simulation:</strong>  
                The project simulates a consistent monthly investment in both the target stock and the S&P 500 (VOO). Over time, it compares the cumulative returns of both.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Performance Metrics & Graphs:</strong>  
                The backtest generates multiple graphs and key performance metrics:
